# Life Goes On

Aside from the Eurydice disaster, what would life have been like on the Isle of Wight at the time, particularly around Ventnor and Sandown, and what were the major issues of the day that the Islanders might have had on their minds?

## Sandown, Up and Coming Holiday Town

Whilst Ventor was the original fashionable holiday destination on the island, with its favourable microcolimate, Sandown was also developing as a holiday destination. Its notable visitors included a certain Rev. C. L. Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, author of *Alice in Wonderland*.

From announcements in the Hampshire Advertiser, it seems that Dodgson visited Sandown over many years. For example, in the issue dated [Saturday 04 October 1873](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000495/18731004/051/0008), p8:

> SANDOWN Oct. 4. FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE. The Rev. C. Dodgson and Miss Dodgson, and Mr. and Mrs. Coop and family have arrived at the King's Head Hotel.

On [Saturday 29 August 1874](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000495/18740829/062/0008), p8:

> SANDOWN, Aug. 29. FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE. ... The Rev. C. Dodgson, the Rev. — Soames, and Mr. and Mrs. Christmas are among the visitors at the King's Head Hotel.

And on [Saturday 02 July 1881](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000495/18810702/079/0008), p8:

> SANDOWN, July 2. Arrivals at the Sandown Hotel.— The fashionable arrivals here include the following visitors : — Mr. and Mrs. Grevais, Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bennett, Rev. C. L. Dodgson, Rev. E. P. Sampson, Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Marchant, Mr. and Mrs. H. Burroughs and family, Mr. and Mrs. J. Sutton and family, Mr. and Mrs. A. Crabbe, Mr. and Mrs. Kronim, &c.

It was whilst staying in Sandown in 1875 that he worked to finish his nonesense poem *The Hunting of the Snark*, first published on March 29th, 1876, that he had started in 1874. During that visit, he met the young  Gertrude Chataway, to who the *Snark* was dedicated in the form of an acrostic.

[The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll (Rev. C. L. Dodgson)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11483/11483-h/11483-h.htm), 1898-05-03, p. ?

Lewis Carroll during the last fifteen years of his life always spent the Long Vacation at Eastbourne; in earlier times, Sandown, a pleasant little seaside resort in the Isle of Wight, was his summer abode. He loved the sea both for its own sake and because of the number of children whom he met at seaside places. Here is another "first meeting"; this time it is at Sandown, and Miss Gertrude Chataway [to whom The Hunting of the Snark was dedicated] is the narrator:—

I first met Mr. Lewis Carroll on the sea-shore at Sandown in the Isle of Wight, in the summer of 1875, when I was quite a little child.

We had all been taken there for change of air, and next door there was an old gentlemen—to me at any rate he seemed old—who interested me immensely. He would come on to his balcony, which joined ours, sniffing the sea-air with his head thrown back, and would walk right down the steps on to the beach with his chin in air, drinking in the fresh breezes as if he could never have enough. I do not know why this excited such keen curiosity on my part, but I remember well that whenever I heard his footstep I flew out to see him coming, and when one day he spoke to me my joy was complete.

Thus we made friends, and in a very little while I was as familiar with the interior of his lodgings as with our own.

I had the usual child's love for fairy-tales and marvels, and his power of telling stories naturally fascinated me. We used to sit for hours on the wooden steps which led from our garden on to the beach, whilst he told the most lovely tales that could possibly be imagined, often illustrating the exciting situations with a pencil as he went along.

One thing that made his stories particularly charming to a child was that he often took his cue from her remarks—a question would set him off on quite a new trail of ideas, so that one felt that one had somehow helped to make the story, and it seemed a personal possession It was the most lovely nonsense conceivable, and I naturally revelled in it. His vivid imagination would fly from one subject to another, and was never tied down in any way by the probabilities of life.

To me it was of course all perfect, but it is astonishing that he never seemed either tired or to want other society. I spoke to him once of this since I have been grown up, and he told me it was the greatest pleasure he could have to converse freely with a child, and feel the depths of her mind.

He used to write to me and I to him after that summer, and the friendship, thus begun, lasted. His letters were one of the greatest joys of my childhood.

I don't think that he ever really understood that we, whom he had known as children, could not always remain such. I stayed with him only a few years ago, at Eastbourne, and felt for the time that I was once more a child. He never appeared to realise that I had grown up, except when I reminded him of the fact, and then he only said, "Never mind: you will always be a child to me, even when your hair is grey."

```


In *Fit the Second, The Bellman's Speech* of the *Hunting of the Snark*, Carroll describes the various marks by which a genuine Snark may be known:

"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,  
Which it constantly carries about,  
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes—  
A sentiment open to doubt.

Such things were a common sight in Sandown at the time.

## The Opening of Sandown Pier

Whilst attempts were being made to raise the Eurydice, other activity had been going on in Sandown Bay, in particular the construction of a pleasure pier. The first part of the pier was opened by a local dignitary of a noble family line, Lady Oglander.

The report is an odd one, and seems to hint at various slights and snipes that may be interesting to dig into further. However, it also reveals something of the national mood at the time, and in particular, the threat of looming war. But war with whom?

The new pier is almost completed, and, although in appearance it is slight, the testing which has taken place this week has been satisfactory Thirty-five tons of sand were placed on the second bay (from one column to another), and there was no deflection of the iron work.

```{admonition} OPENING OF THE NEW PIER. - Saturday, June 1st, 1878
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18780601/010/0005), 1878-06-01, p. 5

Sandown was en fete on Wednesday, the day fixed for the opening of the new pier, and every one seemed impressed with the fact that the event was one of no ordinary importance in the history of the little town. Lady Oglander very kindly consented to perform the opening ceremony, but so unpropitious was the weather at the beginning of the day that for some time it was doubtful whether a postponement would not be necessary. The rain fell all the morning without ceasing, and of course made the roads in the neighbourhood of the pier dirty and muddy ; but, as the hour fixed for the ceremony approached, the sky commenced clearing, and by 3 o'clock it was tolerably fine. A considerable number of persona then began to flock to the pier, the approaches to which were decorated with banners and flags. Across the street which Lady Oglander would have to pass was stretched a banner, bearing the arms of the Oglander family and the motto "Server Munia Vitae," on each side of which was the word " Welcome." Above the street leading to the pier was a banner bearing the words "Success to the Pier," and over the pier gates another, bidding all " Welcome." There was also plenty of bunting about, a number of poles being placed at regular intervals on both sides of the pier, and each carrying a gay flag. With respect to the pier itself, which next claims our notice, it must not be understood that it is actually finished. Only a portion of the structure — half the total length contemplated — is finished, but of course this is sufficient to give a good idea of its general effect, and makes a very nice promenade. Unlike the piers we have seen elsewhere, the seats run down the whole length. From the pierhead can be obtained capital views, not only seaward but of the cliffs, sands, and general scenery of the interior of the Island. The pier looks a very light structure — uncomfortably so, in fact. The iron piles on which it rests are so slight, and their distance one from the other is so great, as to lead one to doubt whether it will be found sufficiently strong to withstand the winter waves which roll into the bay. This uncomfortable feeling was intensified by the appearance of a wreck close at hand — the John Douse— highly suggestive of the stormy waters which the structure will have to withstand ; while further out to sea, and almost in line with the head of the pier, was another dismal sight — the masts of the wreck of the Eurydice, still beneath the waters, and still holding many a score of the bodies of brave young tars. These were two things highly suggestive of what the winds and waves can do about here. We suppose, however, that the lightness of the pier just at the parts which are finished does not matter, and doubtless the structure will be made more substantial as it reaches that portion of the shore where the full fury of the waves will be encountered. However, a pier seems to be a necessity for Sandown, and we congratulate the inhabitants of the little town upon their energy and evident determination to improve the place.

THE OPENING CEREMONY.

Shortly after 4 o'clock the townspeople began to flock to the pier. A number of the members of the Nunwell Volunteers were drawn up on each side of the pier gates, as a sort of guard of honour, under the command of their popular young captain (A. Brook Leeds, Esq.) and Lieut Pound, while the band was stationed at the end of the pier to add harmony to the proceedings. Amongst those assembled at the pier gates to welcome Lady Oglander on her arrival were F. Pittis, Esq. (Mayor of Newport), Col. Currie (chairman of the Ventnor Local Board), Mr. Walter Mew (chairman of the Sandown Local Board), W. H. Wooldridge, Esq (clerk to the Local Board), Mr. Eldridge (town clerk of Newport), the Rev. W. M. Harrison, Dampier Child, Esq , and the following members of the Sandown Local Board : Dr. Bulbeck, Messrs. Linfield, Love, J. K. Hollis, Warne, Pelley, and Box. Lady Oglander arrived punctually at the time fixed, accompanied by Major Leeds, and on alighting from her carriage was received by Mr. Wooldridge, who introduced the Chairman and members of the Sandown Local Board to her ladyship. Mr. Walter Mew (chairman) then stepped forward and presented her ladyship with an address from the Board. In doing so he expressed the great pleasure he felt in seeing her ladyship present, and thanked her for the interest she had always taken in Sandown, at the same time expressing the hope that she would long be spared to them. Mr. Wooldridge then read the address, which was handsomely engrossed on vellum, and signed by 155 ratepayers and inhabitants of the district. It was as follows :

To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Park, Isle of Wight.  
Madam, — We, the Local Board of the district of Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, and the undersigned ratepayers and inhabitants of the district, beg respectfully to express the great pleasure and gratification which it gives us to see your ladyship taking part in, and inaugurating the opening of a Pier in Sandown. We are well assured that your ladyship at all times takes an interest in all ,atters connected with the public welfare of Sandown and its inhabitants ; knowing, as we do, the readiness and liberality with which you have always contributed and assisted all charitable, and other local undertakings, we trust that your ladyship may long be spared and be able to assist, and participate in all public enterprises which may conduce to the prosperity of the town of Sandown, in which, as Lady of the Manor, we feel sure you will always have a deep and sincere interest. With every expression of respect and esteem,  
We are, your ladyship's faithful servants,  
Walter Mew, Chairman.

The Common Seal of the Local Board of Sandown was affixed, this 27th day of May, 1873, in pursuance of a resolution unanimously passed at a special meeting, held on the 24th day of May, 1878, in the presence of Mr. H. Wooldridge, clerk to the Board.

Leaning on the arm of Major Leeds, her ladyship then walked to the end of the pier, which had been carpeted for the occasion. Here she was introduced to the chairman and directors of the Pier Company. Her ladyship having briefly declared the pier open, Mr. Jonathan Jolliffe, the chairman of the company, stepped forward and presented her ladyship with another address. He explained that the company had a hard struggle to get the pier completed so far, but they hoped to be able to make the structure double its present length, and to place a lifeboat at the end. It would then be very useful for yachts and steamers, which would be able to land passengers here. He then presented the address, which was also engrossed on vellum, and read as follows :

To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Park, Isle of Wight.  
Madam, — The chairman and directors of the Sandown Pier Company beg to welcome your ladyship on this, to them, important occasion, and at the same time express their sincere thanks for your kindness in consenting to preside at the opening of the pier. It is only after having overcome many difficulties, and even local opposition, that the directors have at length succeeded im completiing the first section of the pier, so as to permit the same to be opened for the use of the public. However, they hope to receive such pecuniary assistance from residents, owners of property, and others interested in the welfare of Sandown, as may enable them to complete the original design, and carry out the pier to its full lengih of 650 feet, being nearly double the length of the portion already constructed, and so kindly opened by your ladyship. — The directors are sure that the pier will atford a pleasant and agreeable promenade, and prove a source of attraction to the town of Sandowm and its visitors; and they venture also to hope that it may ultimately prove useful, not only for purposes of recreation, but also a station from which a lifeboat may bo launched. Recent sad events that have taken place in the bay deepen the conviction that Sandown will prove a most important station for a lifeboat. For the carrying out so laudable an object the directors can only trust to the liberality and sympathy of the public generally.— Again thanking your ladyship tor the kind interest you have shown in the work the directors have in hand by your presence here to-day, and with every good wish for your welfare and happiness,  
We beg to remain,  
Your ladyship's obedient and faithful servants  
Jonathan Joliffe,  
Richard Dampier Child,  
George Pelley,  
James Kennington.

The seal of the Sandown Pier Company (Limited) was affixed this 28th day of May, 1878, in pursuance of a resolution duly passed at a meeting of the directors im the presence of W. H. Wooldridge, secretary.

This portion of the ceremony concluded, Miss Brandt stepped forward, and, on behalf of the directors presented her ladyship with a very handsome bouquet. Her ladyship briefly replied as follows; "Mr , Chairman and gentleman of the Sandown Local Board and gentlemen of the Sandown Pier Company -I thank you very much for the kind and gratifying reception you have given me. It affords me at all times siccere pleasure to assist im any way in promoting the prosperity of Sandown, and I trust the undertakimg you have so successfully curried out and inaugurated this day may prove one of the many means of adding to the attractions of the place, and an additional source of health and enjoyment to visitors and inhabitants alike. " Hearty cheers were then given for hey ladyship, and a number of the gemtlement present having been introduced to her, the procession again went up the pier; her ladyship and Major Leeds re-entered their carringe, and drove off amidst the loud cheers of the assembled spectators. This concluded the ceremony, which was followed by

As well as reporting on the opening ceremony, an account of banquet to honour the opening also appeared:


```{admonition} A BANQUET, - Saturday, June 1st, 1878
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18780601/010/0005), 1878-06-01, p. 5

which took place at half-past 5, in the Town Hall, where about 70 gnntlemen sat down to the excellent repast provided. The chair was taken by Mr. Jon. Jolliffe, and the vice-chair by Mr. Walter Mew; : there being also present Capt. Brook Leeds, Lieut. Pound, Col. Currie, Rev. W. M. Harrison, Mr. W. H. Wooldridge, Col. Brandt, Mr. F. Pittis, Mr. F. Pittis, jun., Mr. T. H. Urry, Mr. W. H. Barton, Mr. C. G. Vincent, Dr. Meeres, Mr. Binns (engineer), Mr. D. Mitchell, Mr. Linfield, Mr. J. K. Hollis, Mr. L. H. Saunders, Mr. Theodore Saunders, &c. After the removal of the cloth,

Mr. Wooldridge read letters of apology from Mr. Baillie Cochrane, M.P. (who was unable to attend owing to the state of his health), the Mayors of Ryde, Yarmouth (I.W.) and Andover, Mr. F. White Popham, Col. Calthorpe, and others.

The Chairman briefly proposed the usual loyal toasts, which were heartily responded to. He then, proposed "The Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces," coupling with the toast the names of Col. Currie, Col. Brandt, and Capt. Brooke Leeds.

Col Currie congratulated those present upon adding a pier to the attractions of Sandown ; and then, speaking to the toast, said he had seen a great deal of war, and what he had aeen of its horrors led him to hope that peace would be maintained, and if it was maintained with honour to the country it would be the brightest star in the escutcheon of the noble lord who now presided over the destinies of the country (applause).

Col. Brandt, who also responded, was sure that in the present unfortunate discussion England would do her best to be on the right side, and should it end in war the Army, who had never yet been backward when called on, would do its best (applause). God forbid it should end in bloodshed, for he was sure no Englishman wished to see that ; all they wished was to see justice and right done (applause). If we did have a peace he hoped it would not be a patched-up peace, but that the question would now be so settled that there could be no chance of its being brought forward again (applause).

Capf. Brook* Leeds, in responding for the Volunteers, said that the corps he commanded owed a great deal to Sandown, and the numbers who had  joined them from that town enabled them to muster more strongly in proportion than the corps belonging to large and important towns. They would not be able to keep the corps up to this position without the help of Sandown. They had just drafted 15 Sandown men into the corps, and their band was composed five-tenths of Sandown men. Their corps then was virtually, except in name, a Sandown corps. The Volunteers as a body had no politics, and were always ready to do their duty if called on ; but they could not forget that, in spite of the many matters of importance which our present Government had to attend to, they had remembered the Volunteers. A Volunteer commission had been appointed to take into consideration the wants and requirements of the force. Although the Volunteers had their grant there were many other things required, which would no doubt be supplied (applause).

Mr. Dampier Child proposed "The Bishop and Clergy of the Diocese and the Ministers of all Denominations." In spite of certain difference* he thought the Church had the hearty good wishes of all true Englishmen. After regretting the absence of the Vicar, he coupled with the toast the names of the Rev. W. M. Harrison to respond for the Bishop and clergy, and the Rev. Mr. King for the ministers of other denominations.

The Rev. W. M. Harrison said he was extremely pleased to be present on such an auspicious day for Sandown, and he wished their new institution every success. Mr. Dampier Child had alluded to differences of opinion in the Church, but he asked where they did not find differences of opinion. It was so when he was a boy, and he supposed always would be so ; but he believed that, in spite of differences of opinion, his brethren of the Church and those amongst the Nonconformists were coming more into accord, and beginning to see that there was not such a great gulf between them but what they could shake hands ever it. He hoped they would give them credit for that, and would see that though they were parsons on Sunday they had their hearty sympathy on all occasions.

The Rev. Mr. King said he trusted that ministers of all denominations were beginning to see that they were building on one great foundation, and all endeavouring to inculcate one noble principle — good will towards men. He was very pleased to be present on such an occasion. Having been intimately associated with Sandown for a great number of years in greatly rejoiced him to see its increasing prosperity. He believed the construction of the new pier wonld prove a great thing for Sandown, and he hoped that, when completed, it would be crowned with success.

Mr. Pelley in eulogistic terms proposed the health of Lady Oglander, who always took such interest in the town, and had given £10 towards the expenses of the day (loud applause and cheers).

Capt. Leeds responded, and said he wished to tell them what Mr. Wooldridge evidently forgot, that his father, Major Leeds, was unable to be present, and had only been able to attend that afternoon at some risk to himself, for he was very far from well. He thanked them for the hearty way in which the toast was proposed and received. It was unnecessary for him to dilate on the kindness of Lady Oglander. One could not praise one's own relations very well, but he thought they would remember that it was a very difficult matter for any lady to take part in public matters. When, however, Lady Oglander was asked to open the pier, she at once complied, and although the day was not everything which wished, she came and went through the ceremony (applause). It was a pleasmre foe her to do anything to help Sandown. He then thanked them heartily on her behalf.

Mr. L. H. Saunders proposed " Success and Prosperity to the Sandown Pier." He should like to say a few words on the subject, which, as he wad a resident outside Sandown, he hoped would be accepted in all sincerity. The pier so far had been built by a mere handful of men. Fewer men than were assembled in that room had found the capital necessary to build what was nothing less than an institution — the pier which they had seen so ably opened by Lady Oglander that day, and he trusted that all those present, who had not yet done so, had decided to become shareholders. The capital required was £6,000, in 1,200 shares of £5 each, to build a pier 650 feet long, with the object, not only of benefiting the residents, but of bringing an additional number of visitors to Sandown. Perceiving the advantages of such a pier a number of the gentlemen present had put their hands in their pockets, and more than half the capital required had already been subscribed. He thought they ought not to be backward now, for he believed greater profit would accrue now than at the commencement. The pier as at present finished was 350 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it possessed one advantage which they did not often see. He had been on a great many piers, and he found seats generally rather scarce, but on the Sandown pier he noticed that seats ran from end to end, and there was plenty of room for those who could not walk about. He thought that arrangement would greatly contribute to the success of the undertaking. All that was wanted now was the means tor providing the remainder of the money required, ami for an outlay of another £2,500 or so they would be able to complete the pier to the length he had mentioned, so that they would always have nine or ten teet of water at the end of the pier, sufficient for steamers to come alongside at all times and take up or put down excursionists. Although they had a railway to Sandown they wanted something more— accommodation by water, and he hoped to find no difficulty in doing that. He believed it was a fact that all the preliminary expenses of this company—-getting the Bill in Parliament,&c.— in fact, all their Parliamentary expenses, were covered by a cheque for £200. That was sufficient to show that there was no promotion money paid, and he thought such a company, with responsible directors and not overweighted, must be a success. The directors, in addition to the large amount of shares they had taken, rather than open the pier with any liability upon it, had given their names and taken a personal liability for £200 each beyond their holding. That showed the sort of opinion the directors had of the undertaking. In proposing the toast he hoped that every Sandown man would take a share. — The toast was received with three times three.

The Chairman said they were going to carry on the undertaking in an honest, straightforward way and if they only revived support They would make the pier oue of the best litile properties in the Isle of Wight. He had spent a great deal of time and money on the Newport Junction Railway, and if that had only been carried out as he said it ought to have been it would now be paying cent. per cent. A very small sum, only £2,000 more, was required to have the pier 650 ft. long, and not a penny of the money subscribed should be spent except on the pier (cheers).

The Mayor of Newport briefly responded to the toast of his health, and expressed the interest which was taken by the inhabitants of the capital of the Island in the progress and prosperity of Sandown. The easy distance of Sandown from Newport, and its many attractions would make it especially interesting to the inhabitants of the centre of the Island. With respect to the pier he considered it one of the most promising business investments in the Island.

The toast of "The Chairman and Directors", coupled with the name of Mr Binns, followed.

Mr. Binns said it was now some years since he attended the first meeting of the promoters of a scheme for the erection of a pier in their beautiful bay, and being of opinion that something of the sort would be a great acquisition to Sandown he most willingly advocated and supported the movement. A committee was formed and very quietly worked its way, and some three or four years after the plans of the proposed pier— a wooden structure with girders 7ft. deep and 40ft. span, supported on two 12in. cast-iron columns — were sent to him, with the request that he would undertake to superintend its creation, which he declined on the grounds that such a structure was not only out of date, but inelegant. He therefore suggested and got out a design for the structure, which they had this day had the pleasure of opening. The pier, so far as it extends, consists of seven bays of 50ft, span ; in each bay they are three girders 48ft. 9in. in the clear, and 3ft. deep, supported by three cast-iron columns firmly embedded in the gault or "blue slipper," than which nothing could make a firmer foundation. The principal novelty in the structure consists in the dolphin brackets and seat standards. The former are firmly bolted to vertical channel irons forming part of the lattice girder, and on the top of each bracket is bolted an ornamented seat standard ; consequently the two rows of seats, which are continuous throughout the entire length of the pier, are quite independent of the deck planking, which can at any time be taken up for repair, turned over, or renewed without interfering or in any way disturbing the seats.

Col. Brandt proposed the toast, of " The Sandown Local Board," and took a general review of the duties connected with the office of a member of the Local Board, and the difficulties standing in the way of a conscientious discharge of those duties.

Mr. W. Mew, in replying to the toast, assured them that he fully intended, as long as he had the honour of holding his present position at the Board, to faithfully and conscientiously carry out the duties entrusted in his hands.

The toast of "The Visitors " was ably proposed by Mr. W. H. Wooldridge, and responded to by Mr. Linfield, of Ventnor.

Mr. Pittis proposed in deservedly eulogistic terms. "The health of the secretary of the Pier Company," Mr. W. H. Wooldridge.

Mr. Wooldridge, in acknowledging the warm manner in which the toast had been received, very grotesquely described the difficulties of the day, and trusted he had been successful in surmounting those and other general difficulties connected with his office as well as it could reasonably be expected a man could do.

The toasts of "The Ladies" and "The Press" brought the proceedings to a close.

## Looming War

The toasts at the opening of Sandown Pier at the end of May, 1878, hinted in passing that Britain was perhaps on the verge of war. So what was the cause of this sense of rising national tension?


```{admonition} THE EASTERN QUESTION. - Saturday, May 4th, 1878
:class: note dropdown

[Illustrated London News](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001578/18780504/033/0006), 1878-05-04, p. 6

The equivocal attitude of Russia, and the distrust of her real intentions, with regard to the disputed reference of the Treaty of San Stefano to the proposed European Congress, agreeably to the demand made by the British Government, continue to excite the worst apprehensions. The Grand Duke Nicholas has this week taken leave of the Russian army in Turkey, and has returned home way of Odessa, after a farewell visit to the Sultan at Constantinople. General Todleben has taken the chief command of the army instead of the Grand Duke. lie is said to have again urged on the Turks the evacuation of Shumla, Varna, and Batoum, and to have intimated that, in the event of the Porte at once yielding to this demand, the Russians would withdraw to the fortified lines of Tchekmedje, Tchataldja, and Derkos. Turkish Council of War, attended by Osman Pasha and Mukhtar Pasha, has this matter under consideration.

The entry of portion of the Russian troops into Constantinople, for the Easter services the Greek churches in that city, was prudently countermanded. Their Easter service was performed in the church of San Stefano. The village was decked out with evergreens and coloured lanterns. the entry of the Grand Duke, the priests, the officers of the staff, carrying sacred pictures, and the soldiers with church banners, formed procession and marched round the church. The congregation joined in the Easter Hymn, and mass was chanted. The service lasted an hour and a half. The Grand Duke entertained all the officers at supper afterwards. The customary firing of cannon was dispensed with, and the review was not held, in consequence of the heavy rain having converted the plain into a mud swamp.

The Russian authorities assert that the revolt of Turks collected in the Rhodope Mountains was caused bands of soldiers belonging to Suleiman Pasha’s army of Bashi-Bazouks. There is no trace of an organised or general rising of Mussulmans. There are a few Russian outposts there, but the country is not comprised within territory under Russian administration. On the other hand, intelligence has been received of an afiray between some Turkish and Russian soldiers, caused an attempt of the latter to enter the lines of Boulair. Several men were killed or wounded; and it is probable that the Russian official accounts greatly underrate the hostility of the Turkish population.

The British fleet has left Ismid for tactical exercise and artillery practice at sea. It will anchor at Touzla, and return in two days to Ismid. Diplomacy has not succeeded in its efforts to arrange the simulfnneous withdrawal of the Russian army and the British fleet from the neighbourhood of Constantinople. The Russians are stated to regard war with England as inevitable. At the Porte, also, the hopes of pacific arrangement have become weaker.

It is stated that there are now 56,000 Russian troops in Roumanian territory, and that considerable additions to that force ore on the march thither. Russian diplomatists are continuing their endeavours to induce the Roumanian Government to conclude new military convention, but hitherto without success.

The insurrection of the Greeks in Thessaly seems but partially subdued. The number of Turkish troops now the province cannot be much short of 30,000, whilst that of their opponents is about 11,000, in bodies varying from 200 to 1000 cr 2000. But their knowledge of the country and capacity to endure hardship quite make up for the disparity in numbers. The Turkish naval forces are considerable, both here and on the coasts, there seldom being less than four ironclads in the port of Volo, while as many are at Salouica or cruising between this and the entrance of the Gulf of Salonica. They are principally employed for preventing the landing of and men to join the insurgents.

A party of Russian engineers and other officers, bound on some secret service, have passed through Egypt to the Red Sea. Erom America, too, hear of a mysterious Russian expedition. A hired steam-vessel called the Cimbria is lying in a port of Maine, having on board, in addition to the German ordinary crew, sixty Russian officers and six hundred Russian seamen, under the command of Count Grifenburg. There is a strong opinion that they are destined for San Francisco, to man Russian privateers already in the Pacific Ocean. The calling-up of 4000 fresh seamen is, we leam, causing great stir in naval circles at St. Petersburg. Plans are being prepared the Russian Government for the formation three powerful squadrons. One of these, consisting of the strongest frigates, and reinforced by the steamers which Russia is on the point of purchasing in America, will be dispatched in May to cruise in the North Sea; to a second, comprising eight or nine somewhat obsolete ironclads, will be assigned the duty of cruising about the Baltic; while the third, composed of eleven small monitors and a large number of gun-boats and torpedo-vessels, will be dispersed between Cronstndt, Sweaborg, and Riga. The defensive operations of the “inshore squadron” will be waged almost exclusively with the torpedo.

The prospects a pacific settlement have apparently improved during the past week the opening of direct negotiations between England and Russia, through the agency of Count Schouvaloff, the Russian Ambassador to this country, who has been summoned to St. Petersburg for personal conference with the Emperor Alexander II. It is now proposed that, waiving the formal question of the extent of authority to be ascribed to a Congress, each of the opposing parties to this controversy should make a positive declaration to what they think are their vital interests the East which they are determined to maintain at all hazards. A similar course has been taken in the Russo-Austrian negotiations. If the English and Russian Governments come to an understanding in this respect, then the Congress may meet to give a European sanction to Austro-English-Russian arrangements.

The tone of the St. Petersburg official journals has become much more temperate. Speaking of what ought, in the interest of peace, to be the result of the journey of Count Schouvaloif to St. Petersburg, the Agencc liusse says ; Russia has no thought of setting aside the legitimate influence of England in Turkey, or of exercising an exclusive preponderance in that Moreover, facts prove the inanity of such a claim, since, in spite of the blood shed, the treasure expended, and ihe victories gained by the Russians, English influence is at the present moment still predominant at Constantinople. The Russian Government recognises so fully the legitimacy of English influence that, even before the war, it invited England again and again to come, to a common understanding for a pacific solution of the difficulties existing, not only in regard to Turkey, but even to the far East."

The Grand Duke Nicholas, on his return to Russia, issued a farewell address to the Russian army in Turkey, naming General Todlebeu as their new Commander-in-Chief, and giving them to understand that they will perhaps be called upon engage in a fresh conflict to secure the fruits of the late victorious war, but exhorting them to treat the Turks brothers.” It seems certain that General Todleben is about to retire to the lines of Tchataldja, leaving a small force at San Stefano. The Russians offer to fall back behind a straight line drawn between Dedeagatch and Adrianople, if the British fleet -will withdraw at the same time. part of the Varna garrison has reached Constantinople, but the question of the immediate evacuation of Yama, Shnmla, and Batoum by the Turks is not yet settled, notwithstanding tire urgency of Russia. It is, indeed, announced that on Wednesday last the Porte decided to hand over those fortresses if the Russians withdraw to Adrianople; but the details are not arranged. The Russians occupy Livana and the environs of Batoum, and fresh troops have landed at Bourgas. It is said that Russia has recently stopped the extradition of the Turkish prisoners of war who are fit for service. She thus retains about 60,000 men of Turkey's best troops, some of them being the defenders of Plevna.

The new province of Bulgaria, in the parts south of the Balkans, is far from being entirely subdued by its Russian patrons. The latest accounts of the Mahommedan insurrection tpeak of a movement of insurgent bands more to the west and Deeper in among the mountains; but it does not seem clear whether this owing to their having been pressed back, or merely to an attempt to take a more central position in face of the considerable Russian forces which have been sent against them from all sides. They seem to have entirely disappeared ircm the Maritza Valley. Still, there can scarcely be any material alteration in the whole position, else we should have heard something from the Russians themselves. Advices from Adrianople and Phrlippopolis, under date the 1st and 2nd inst., report continued fighting about Haskioi, in which district twenty Mohammedan villages jhave been destroyed, the Russians laying blame on the Bulgarians, the Bulgarians on the Russians. There have been many arrests at Adriarrople, among them Bulgarians accused of complicity in the destruction of Turkish villages. The insurgents have not descended into the plain further west than Haskioi; hut the Pomaks or Bulgarian Mussulmans co-operate with the main body of the insurgents, furnishing a contingent and holding the mountain passes. To counteract this movement Russian force is marching from Sophia.

The Turkish Government has received the proposals which have been formulated the insurgents of Thessaly and Epirus, through the mediation of the British Consuls, Messrs, alerliu and Blunt, for the pacification of those provinces. The insurgents demand a general amnesty and mutual disarmament, and it is hoped that an arrangement will be effected on the basis of these moderate proposals. The Turkish irregular troops, Gheggas and Amaouts Irom Albania, and Zeibeks from Asia, who have perpetrated horrible outrages, are to be removed from Thessaly; and the Greek volunteers are to be conveyed H.M.S. Falcon home to Greece. In Macedonia, likewise, the British Consuls have met the chiefs of the insurgents, who have accepted the same terms as the Thessahans—namely, that the volunteers shall keep their arms and return to Greece, either hoard a British man-of-war or, if they prefer it, by land. The native insurgents will return to their homes and retain their arms.

The Servians have established a strong military post at Kustendil, oil the Mitrowitza and Salonica Railway line. Military communications with Old Servia have been rendered difficult the. raids of the Mohammedan Arnaouts, 9000 of whom have taken positions in the mountain ranges. These marauders are stated to have committed atrocities in Servian villages.

The Cabinet of Vienna has opened negotiations with the Porte respect to the occupation the Austro-Hungarian troops of the fortress of Ada Kaleh, which will shortly be evacuated the Turkish garrison conformably with the Treaty of San Stefano. The Austrians reckon on the consent of the Porte, so that the free navigation of the Danube may be secured, and that Servia may be prevented from taking possession of this fortress. Meanwhile, a contradiction is given to the reports of a concentration of Austrian troops on the Bosnian frontier, and it is declared that Austria will not occupy that province without the consent of the Porte.

The Emperor Alexander of Russia is taking counsel with his Ambassador to Queen Victoria, Count Sohouvaloff, who arrived from London at St. Petersburg on Sunday evening, and who is supposed to bring bun authentic information of the demands of our own Government. Prince Gortchakoff’s illness may delay the progress of negotiations ; but there is indication, hitherto, of the probable result, which seems to depend entirely upon the Emperor’s personal decision. It is said that one of the points upon which the British Government insists most strongly is that of its objection to the cession of the Turkishfortress of Batomn, at the south-east corner of the Black Sea. The Turkish Government continues to evade, under various pretexts, the execution of those clauses of the Treaty of San Stefano which promise the surrender of Shumla, Varna, and Batoum to the Russians; while General Todlebeu, who has succeeded the Grand Duke Nicholas in command of the army near Constantinople, is urging the point with increased vehemence. The troops at San Stefano are being encamped in tents on the hills two miles nearer to Constantinople. It is expected that Adrianoplc will fortified by General Todleben with all the resources at his command. Shumla will most likely be given up to him by the Turks, as its communications with Varna have been cut off by the Russians at Pravady. The formation of a Bulgarian army under Russian command has been commenced, and it seems to be much needed, the Russians being now called upon to suppress the Mussulman insurrection in the Rhodope mounteins, south-west of Adrianople, and finding it a difficult task. It is, nevertheless, considered that the Turkish army is not in a condition to resist the occupation of Constantinople by the Russians, which had been threatened by General Todleben if Shumla, Varna, and Batoum were not surrendered at once. From Asiatic Turkey we hear that the Russians have occupied Tchuruk-su, near Batoum. They forcibly disarmed the population, and during the proceedings losses were inflicted on both sides.

At Constantinople there is an announcement of certain organic laws and administrative, judicial, and military reforms which are being elaborated by order of the Sultan. Sadyk Pasha is reported to have proposed to the Sultan a political programme restraining the palace influence, increasing the independence of the Porte, and promoting administrative decentralisation. On Friday the Sultan gave a dinner to Mr. Xayard, and several Turkish Generals. General Sir Collingwood Dickson, and Baker Pasha were among the guests ; the Sultan, speaking to Baker Pasha, said he would never forget bis services. Prince Labanoff, the new Russian Ambassador, has arrived at Constantinople.

The official journal of St. Petersburg publishes an appeal of ihe Moscow Society for subscriptions for the organisation of the volunteer fleet, "in order to defend the just cause in case the adversary of Russia should provoke war." In St. Petersburg contributions will be received by the Czirewifoh.

In Greece much uneasiness is felt lest the suspension of hostilities in Thessaly should enable the Porte to send fresh troops to Crete and overpower the insurrection there. It is deemed highly desirable that the same truce and the same guarantees in favour of the insurgents of the mainland should he extended to the island.

Our Special Artist in Turkey furnishes this week’s Illustrated London News with two Sketches of warlike precautions now going on at the Dardanelles and in the Sea of Marmora, notwithstanding the pacific tone in which Count Sohouvaloff's late conference with the Emperor of Russia is spoken of by the newspaper and telegraph correspondents at St. Petersburg and Berlin. The Turkish soldiers at work strengthening their lines of fortifications at Boulair in front of Gallipoli, is one of our Illustrations of the War that has scarcely yet been terminated between that Empire and Russia; while the situation of the British squadron in the Gulf of Ismid, few hours' sail-eastward of Constantinople, gets some light thrown upon it by the apparatus used at night on board H.M.S. Agingcourt, in looking out for possible torpedo-boats, though her Maiesty's Government is actually still at peace with the Russian Empire and every other Power. It is not incumbent upon us to reconcile these contradictory facts and incidents, but to represent their visible aspects to the eyes of our readers, and there is no occasion for any further comment, as we have already described both the position and manoeuvres of Admiral Hornby's naval force, and the military defensive preparations of the Turks on the shore of the DardaneUes. We can but hope that neither the one nor the other will have to stand the brunt of conflict with the Russian forces in that part of the world, but that the efforts of diplomacy to bring about a peaceable settlement of the Eastern Question may soon be crowned with abiding success.

Count Schouvaloff, the Russian Ambassador to her Majesty Queen Victoria, arrived in England on Wednesday last, having returned from St. Petersburg after his conference with the Emperor Alexander II., and having again seen Prince Bismarck, on his way back, as well as in his journey from this country to Russia. The result of these deliberations will not be made public till it has been officially dealt with in the communications of our Foreign Office with the Russian Government; but Count Schouvaloff had an interview with Lord Salisbury on the day after his arrival. There is a rumour of some propositions which the Russian Government believe will be acceptable to the English Cabinet; the questions bearing upon Turkey in Europe to be submitted to a Congress, whilst those bearing upon Asia Minor it is proposed should be made Ihe subject of a separate convention between Russia and Great Britain. The Russian propositions are stated to be drawn up the' most conciliatory terms; but we are by means assured that they will be found sufficiently definite and explicit to form the basis of amicable deliberations in the Congress which once more talked of, and which must be allowed to take full cognisance of the whole Eastern Question. Prince Labanoff, the new Russian Ambassador at Constantinople, on Sunday received the principal Russian residents, to whom be made a speech expressing hopes of peace, at the same time warning them against being too sanguine, the situation being still one of great tension. There is still considerable activity in the Russian army near Constantinople. Troops are being continually sent to join the forces of General Todleben before the Turkish capital, and these, in turn, are replaced by other regiments from Adrianople. It is, however, alleged that this ovement among the Russian troops is simply a withdrawal to a more healthy locality inland. It seems that General Todleben lately ordered the divisional commanders to throw out and maintain advance posts all along the line. This appeared from the Turkish side to be an advance of the Russian army. In one village it brought the two outposts together, and the Turks fell back, leaving a narrowed space between themselves and the Russians. This movement, and the demand of General Todleben for the evacuation of the fortresses, caused great excitement and alarm in Constantinople. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday the Russian troops continued their forward movement towards the Bosphorus, till General Skobeleff, reinforced with artillery from Tchataldja, has stationed his troops quite close to the Sweet Waters. Gsman, Baker, Ahmed Mukhtar, and Fuad Pashas have inspected all the Turkish lines, and ordered the detachments the front not to retire. Russo-Turkish commission is to fix the exact line of demarcation.

There have been serious political riots among the Mussulman population at Constantinople, led by frantic Softa, or student of Moslem theology and law, named Ali Suavi. About noon last Monday a crowd of his fanatical followers, bent on deposing Sultan Abdul Hamid, went to the Tcheragan Palace, occupied the ex-Sultan Murad, and demanded to see him. The crowd persisting alter being refused admittance, the ringleader was shot one of the sentries on duty ; after which the mob dispersed. Tire incident caused considerable excitement in the afternoon, but by nightfall quiet was restored. Next morning 5000 refugees assembled and sent a deputation to the Porte, representing that provisions had failed, that sickness was increasing among them, and asking for relief. They were promised that henceforth rations should be regularly distributed to them.

The Greek insurrection in Crete has not yet been appeased, and intelligence was received at Athens on Saturday that hostilities had been renewed between the insurgents and the Turks in the neighbourhood of Canea. Over 30,000 refugees, from Thessaly and Macedonia, are stated to be now upon Greek territory, and a destitute condition. Many of them have enlisted in the Greek army.

The transport of British Indian troops through the Suez Canal, on their way to Malta, has been going on briskly since the end of last week. The Goa and the Duke of Athol were the first vessels to pass. We leam that the Madura and Hospodar, with Indian troops on board, reached Suez on Saturday, and entered the canal. The same evening the steamer Suez, towing the Bramhletye, arrived at Suez, and left for Port Said next morning. noon on Sunday the Canara steamer arrived, and entered the canal in the afternoon The Steamer St. Osyth, with a regiment of Ghoorkas on board and the whole staff of the expedition, was detained three days at Adeu repairing her machinery. The Euesian papers have published the appeal put forward by a national committee, of which the Czarevitch is president, for raising subscription funds to purchase and equip a fleet of armed vessels to attack an enemy’s merchant-ships in case of war. His Imperial Highness remarks that Eussia has adversary whom it necessary to attack at sea. Russian sailors will soon he able to find out that adversary’s weak point if they have abundance of good and rapid ships. Dozens of vessels,” he adds, under the command of competent captains, may be scattered all over the commercial routes of the enemy, and put stop to his universal trade.” But he also points out that the ships will he available in time of peace as Eussiau merchant navy.

## Temperance Movement

From evidence we have already seen, the temperance movement appears to have formed part of the background of daily life in 1878. The Emma, the ship that rescued Cuddiford and Fletcher, was a "temperance craft", and a lodge of the Good Templars, a fraternal temperance society, had been lost on the Eurydice.

On the Island, Liberal Party campaigners supporting the Liberal M.P. for Newport, Mr. Charles Clifford, were attempting to find a way to be supportive of the latest attempt by Sir Wilfrid Lawson, long time temperance campaigner, to pass a temperance related Bill whilst not antagonising folk with more permissive liberal views.


```{admonition} Liberal Party Truckelling to Teetotallers. - Saturday, February 15th, 1879
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790215/017/0008), 1879-02-15, p. 8

— A public meeting was held at the Queen's Rooms on Thursday evening, in support of Sir Wilfred Lawson's resolution to be submitted to the House of Commons on the 11th proximo: "-That in the granting and renewing of licenses for the public sale of intoxicating drinks, it is both expedient and just that the will of the ratepayers should be consulted." Mr. Councillor H. J. Orchard was in the chair, supported by the Rev. Canon Connon, vicar, the Rev. B. L Green (Unitarian minister), the Rev. W. B. Lark (Bible Christian minister), and Messrs. W. Denness, R. Bullen, John Pierce, W.C, W. H. Day, and C. Jolliffe. Evidently all were intent upon making political capital at the next election for Mr. C. C. Clifford, who has promised to support Sir Wilfred's resolution. It appears that the Liberal party here, in view of the general election, finding that it would be inexpedient to make teetotallism a plank in the Liberal platform, have determined on truckling to the teetotallers in an underhand way, so as to avoid giving offence to the many Liberals who are strongly opposed to restrictive class legislation as to inns. There was the recent *sudden* conversion of the Liberal Unitarian minister to teetotalism, and the organ of the Pinnock section of Liberals rejoicing over him as one " who would be a great acquisition to the Island teetotal platform." Mr. Green was at once hand and glove with the Vicar in the teetotal agitation, under the patronage of the Liberal Bishop of the diocese. The Vicar, having cut his connection with the Constitutional Working Men's Association, who were holding a meeting at the same time, was enabled to attend this Liberal teetotal meeting, and propose a resolution to the effect, that it is expedient and just to take the power of granting and renewing inn licenses out of the hands of the magistrates. He proposed this, because he thought the ratepayers should have a direct voice in these Licensing matters, and that there should be power to refuse renewal of licenses to some houses, in order to lessen the number—the mere presence of so many publichouses offering, as they did, irresistable temptations to the masses of the people. — Mr. Bullen having seconded the resolution, a ratepayer, addressing the meeting, pointed out that this resolution, on the face of it, implied present mal-administration in licensing matters on the part of the county and borough magistrates. The proposer had advanced nothing in proof of mal-administration, for the simple reason that there was nothing, and therefore his position was untenable. As to the bare assertion that a large number of publichouses in a town was more irresistible to the masses than a small number, statistics showed that it was not so. And the reason of this was not far to seek. Amongst the masses who use publichouses, more or less, the number of those who are so besotted as to be allured to drink on nearing a publichouse was happily very inconsiderable. Perhaps no clearer proof of this could be offered than the marked absence of anything like a "run" upon houses having on occasions of dinner parties, license to keep open an hour or two after the usual time for closing. Here in Newport the experience of the last six years showed that a "run" upon a house having extension of time for inn business was unknown. Recently the chief constable of a county, at quarter sessions, said the same thing of his county. It was manifest that the teototal party agitators had all along rested their claims on the public for countenance and support, on this gross misrepresentation, that the masses, not merely the scum, were so besotted as to need " more restrictive class legislation for protection against themselves." As to the manner in which the magistrates as licensing authorities were discharging their duties, there was the fact that the teetotal party had not ventured to bring evidence to make out a plausible case for taking the power from their hands. Lord Aberdare, the author of "Bruce's " Act, of 1872, had recently administered to the Permissivites a severe rebuke for their want of common honesty in systematically hiding from view the manner in which the law as it stands is operating against anything like looseness in granting uew licenses. So far from looseness in the matter were the licensing authorities carrying it, that it was most difficult to obtain a license in cases where the requirements of the public were most palpable. Every part of the country furnished instances where the licensing authority at quarter sessions again and again refused to confirm the grant of such licenses at couuty petty sessions.

)

> Temperance
>
> Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet (4 September 1829 – 1 July 1906) was an English temperance campaigner and radical, anti-imperialist Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1859 and 1906. He was recognised as the leading humourist in the House of Commons.
>
> Although Lawson did not enter the House of Commons on behalf of the Temperance movement he became their chief parliamentary spokesman. In 1863 he spoke in favour of a Bill to introduce the Sunday closing of public houses.Later that year he proposed that "the Laws under which Licences are granted for the sale of Intoxicating Liquors are eminently unsatisfactory and deficient in power to protect the public, and therefore require immediate alteration." After the resolution was heavily defeated he was encouraged to introduce his Permissive Bill. On 8 June, Lawson rose in front of a packed House of Commons to deliver a speech of great ability that filled four pages of Hansard, to move the second reading of the first of several Permissive Bills. A policy that later became known as Local Option and eventually Local Veto, The Bill was fashioned to embody the convictions but not the policy of the United Kingdom Alliance. he did not propose to prohibit the sale of liquor by enactment. The Bill provided that on application of any district, be that parish, town or borough, the votes of the ratepayers should be cast on the question of whether the trade in alcoholic beverages should exist in that district or not; where a majority of two-thirds of the ratepayers would be required to decide the outcome. The Bill was heavily defeated by a majority of 257. He reintroduced the bill again in 1869, 1870, 1871,1873, 1874, 1876, 1878. In 1879, he varied his attack on the drink trade by proposing a Resolution in place of the Permissive Bill. Taking the words from a recommendation of the Convocation of the Province of Canterbury, he asked that inhabitants of districts, being the persons most interested in the licensing of Public Houses, should themselves have the power of stopping such licensing, if they objected to having the trade forced upon them.[77] In the following year he moved his resolution on two occasions, In the first he was defeated by a majority of 114 votes, whereas on the second occasion he carried his motion by 26 votes. Although he carried the motion again in 1881 and 1883 with majorities of 42 and 87, Gladstone's government failed to enact the policy.

So how did Mr. Clifford, M.P,. vote in the matter of Sir Wilfrid Lawson's proposal?


```{admonition} THE LIBERAL PARTY TRUCKLING TO TEETOTALLERS. - Saturday, March 22nd, 1879
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790322/011/0006), 1879-03-22, p. 6

The division list on Sir Wilfrid Lawson's resolution shows that both Mr. C. C. Clifford, the Liberal member for Newport, who intends to offer himself for re-election here, and the Hon. Evelyn Ashley, M.P. for Poole, who is pledged in the Liberal interest to contest the seat for the county of the Isle of Wight, voted for the resolution, which was in favour of taking out of the hands of the magistrates the power of granting and renewing inn licenses. Mr. Evelyn Ashley's leaning in favour of more restrictive class legislation as to inn businesses, subversive of the personal freedom of the artisans and labourers, and the class next above them, was well known. But who would have thought of Mr. Clifford truckling to the teetotallers at last ? Sir Wilfrid's resolution, like his Permissive Bill, was based on the bare assumption to teetotal agitators, that the masses (and not merely the scum which has been so much reduced as to be scarcely perceptible to casual observers in large public holiday gatherings of artisans and labourers) are so besotted that every publichouse they come near proves an irresistible temptation to drink. And on this assumption, in the face of the clearest evidence to the contrary, we are asked to believe that "more restrictive legislation as to inns is needed to protect the masses against themselves ." There is growing a feeling of righteous indignation throughout the Island against the unseemly clamorous and mischievous teetotal agitation ; and, doubtless, a large majority of the electors of the Island at the hustings will bear in mind this truckling of the two Liberal candidates to the teetotallers. During the last six years the country has been flooded with temperance leaflets, setting forth this purely ideal want of self-restraint, and consequent deep degradation of the masses of artisans and labourers, and also the many other teetotal fallacies. And, for truth's sake, it is much to be deplored that the two Defence Leagues of Licensed Victualler- (the only organisations for resisting infringement of the personal liberty of the subj ct. in the incessant teetotal attacks on the trade) have, through poverty, as we understand, entirely omitted from" their programme the issue of leaflets exposing these teetotal fallacies, and disabusing the minds of the public. We have it on good authority, that a "leading bishop," untainted with the teetotal heresy, and honestly seeking the truth of the matter, having gone about amongst the masses, carefully noting everything at large gatherings of artisans and labourers on pleasure bent, with abundant means and facilities for indulgence in excessive drinking, fell in with a very intemperate temperance agitator, and ventured to ask him, " Where is all this intemperance you are speaking about for I really do not see the drunken men about." And the reply to the right, rev. prelate's question of fact was, " My lord, because you won't see, and not because you can't see. There are hundreds of people born blind to it!" Take the facts noted by this good bishop, together with statistics—see Mr. W. T. Wilson's pamphlet, *Law and Liquor*, published by Weldon and Co., Fleet-street showing that in the eastern counties, where publichouses are most numerous ia proportion to population, drunkenness is less than in counties where the houses are much fewer in proportion to population. And take also the marked absence of anything like a " run " upon publichouses in towns, large or small, having, on occasion of late dinner parties, license to keep open to the public an hour or two after the usual time for closing; and we have clear, undisputablo evidence that the maligned masses of artisans and labourers of this country are sober and orderly men, possessing manly self-control in respect of strong drink ; and that they no more stand in need of restrictive legislation as to inns, for " protection against themselves," than the aristocracy. If the masses had not this self-control, their large gatherings would present the inevitable outcomes— disgraceful scenes of drunkenness and tumult ; and magistrates throughout the country would have long since ceased to grant licenses for extension of time for inn businesses, on account of the " run " upon inns having such licenses. Our Army is recruited by tin- labourers and artisans, and where are the evidences of their want of pluck and endurance ? It is noteworthy, as showing that very few of our senators have endeavoured to grasp the subject, that in the debates of the House of Commons on the numerous teetotal nostrums, which have troubled the House of late years, Sir Wilfrid Lawson and his followers have never been met with this argument, which, we submit, is most conclusive, and completely cuts the ground from under them. " The teetotaller at large," clamouring to fasten the legislative muzzle of restraint on his neighbours at every turn, rests his cane wholly on his bare assertion that the masses of our people have sunk so low as to be utterly incapable of self-control. And he insists that benefit society meetings, Army and Navy pensioners' pay meetings, and coroners' courts ought *not* to be held at publichouses, *because there is the temptation to drink*. Ihe long-experienced managers of benefit societies; the sober, steady pensioners; and men who have served as coroners' jurors in town and country, in " respectable" parts of the city, and in the slums, hundreds of times, and know more on this point than coroners, who are present *only* during the enquiry, in vain relate their experience, and show clearly that he is altogether wrong in his assumption that this attendance at a publichouse is unharmful. Good, easy, well-meaning folks take the teetotal statements for granted, and readily part with their money in aid of Bands of Hope and other teetotal societies, with their marked attendant worse evils than immoderate indulgence in strong drinks ; and thus they help to perpetuate those evils, some of which are pointed out in the saying of Dr. Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln : " The pledge is unscriptural and heretical, and it is a deadly sin for Christians to sign it, inasmuch as it leads to lying and disregard of truth, and tends to raise a generation of hypocrites." *—Communicated.*
