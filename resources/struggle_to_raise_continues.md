THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

It is now more than six weeks since the Eurydice sank, and, so far from the wreck being nearer the surface, it has become embedded still deeper in sand and clay. Three hundred tons was the strain estimated at the last attempt to raise the vessel, but experience has been gained by the failure, aud the authorities are providing a lifting power of 1,000 tons for the next attempt. Toggles are to be inserted in each porthole, and hawsers attached to them as weil as passed uuder the ship. The lifting power thus obtained will be tremendous, and, unless some parts of the vessel are carried away by the enormous strain, the wreck is almost certain to be lifted. Large steel hawsers are to be used, and in consequence of the increased amount of lift, additional lighters are being prepared. It is proposed to take out the fore and mizen masts before lifting the ship. Although the extent of the requirements of the relief cannot even now be fully known, it has been proved that 43 widows and 50 children have been rendered destitute, and appeals for help have come from 57 mothers, six sisters, and five other relatives.

On Wednesday a body was found floating close to the wreck. It was placed in a boat, aud lowed by a tug into Portsmouth Harbour. From the description of the clothing it was evident that the body was that of one of the crew of the Eurydice. It was in an advanced state of decomposition, and therefore perfectly unrecognisable, except by tattoo marks on the breast, or by the clothes. A diver encountered a body in the fore channel, but in attempting to raise it the hand came off, and this is missing from the body. This is the first body recovered out of the more than 30O persons who went down with the ill-fated craft more than five weeks since. The corpse was taken to Haslar Hospital.

A correspondent writing to a contemporary says : How are we to pronounce the name of the ill-fated vessel which went down in the snow-storm of the 24th ult. ? Classical readers will have no difficulty in deciding on what ought to be the pronunciation, but nine persons out of ten persist in dividing the word into only three syllables, laying the accent on the ultimate, thus— Eu-ry-d*i*ce. The "correct thing," however, is to call the wrecked vessel Eu-ryd-i-ce making it sound as four syllables and accenting the ante-penultimate, or second syllable. In heathen mythology Eurydice was the wife of the poet Orpheus. As she fled before Aristaeus, who wished to do her violence, she was bitten by a serpent in the grass and died of the wound. Orpheus was so disconsolate that he ventured to go to Hades, where, by the melody of his lyre, he obtained from Pluto the restoration of his wife to life provided he did not look behind him before he came upon earth. He violated the condition; his eagerness to see his wife rendered him forgetful, he looked behind and Eurydice was for ever taken from him. Will the attempt to recover the unfortunate vessel be any more successful?

CORRESPONDENCE. THE WRECK THE EURYDICE.

To the Editor of the Evening News.

Sir, —Some three weeks or more ago, it was freely published in various papers throughout the country, that the public were becoming greatly dissatisfied with the fact that the Eurydice, with probably over 150 bodies on board, had not been raised. On Sunday, March 24th, the Eurydice foundered with her living freight off Dunnose, and freely state is a national disgrace that, close proximity to our greatest naval port, the ship should be in far worse state now than when she foundered. Prior to my entering the dockyard service, had some knowledge wrecks, which is thoroughly implanted on my memory. In the present case, there has been employed a Master Attendant, an Assistant Master Attendant, the Chief and Assistant Constructors of Portsmouth Dockyard, and the Master Attendant and Chief Constructor of Chatham Dockyard but with all their superior knowledge (because superior knowledge it must be) the Eurydice still lays where she fonndered. What practical man in wrecking, would have thought of employing such vessels as the Pearl, Rinaldo, two dockyard lighters, and now, the Swan and Wave, both old gunboats. I certainly should not have done so. I should have designed certain camels and placed them in such positions that I am certain, barring all casualties, the Eurydice would long ere this have been safe in Portsmouth Harbour. Nearly a fortnight ago I was talking to Capt. Coppin on other matters, when asked my opinion of the Eurydice, which I gave him. The plan of this country is, unfortunately, to take the advice of the man receiving the largest salary.  
I am, Sir, yours obediently,  
Southsea, May 11. A Practical Shipwright.
