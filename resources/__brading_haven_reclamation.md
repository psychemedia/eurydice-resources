# The Brading Harbour Reclamation Project Continues

Alhtough the story of the Eurydice brought us to the Island of 1878, what of the Island in few years afterwards, and in particular, the developments at Bembridge and St Helens?

A guide to the Isle of Wight, published in 1895, describes the scene of the reclamation just a few years on.

he former lines. A map of the island, published in 1610, shows the ancient conditions very clearly. The eastern peninsula is there called the *Isle of Bembridge*, the western the *Isle of Freshshwater* ; and twelve years later it was proposed to make the latter into a real island by cutting a trench to the sea at Freshwater Gate, and to fortify it as a refuge and citadel in case of an invasion.

From Brading town to St. Helen's stretched until recently the wide estruary of Brading Haven. Now, with the exception of enough to make a useful harbour at Bembridge, this great estuary, where Sir John Oglander's father would shoot " forty fowl of a night," has been reclaimed by the directors of the " Liberator " Companies.

The nature of the appeal made by this wild scheme in the first instance to the daring speculators who, seventeen years ago, embarked the resources of the company in an enterprise of which not only the practical difficulty, but the financial worthlessness, had already been proved by actual experiment, as early as the reign of James I., will probably remain among the unknown factors of commercial failure. The belief in the possibility of getting "Something for nothing," due to the notion that land won from the sea is a kind of treasure-trove, may have quieted the first misgivings of shareholders. But the fact that Sir Hugh Myddelton, the engineer of the New River, though a " crafty fox and subtle citizen," as Sir Oglander noted, had ultimately failed, not only to maintain his reclamationofBradingHaven,buttomakeit paywhilethedamlasted, was well known in the history of engineering ; and though the mechanical difficulties might be overcome by modern machinery, the nature of the harbour bottom for the growth or non-growth of crops and grasses could hardlyhavechanged. Briefly,the past history of the Brading reclamation was as follows. In 1620 Sir Hugh Myddelton dammed the mouth of the river Yar at Bembridge, opposite Spithead, and on the seven hundred acres of land so reclaimed he "tried all experiments in it ; he sowed wheat, barley, oats, cabbage-seed, and last of all rape-seed, which proved best ; but all the others came to nothing." " The nature of the ground, after it was inned," wrote Sir John Oglander, " was not answerable to what was expected, for almost the moiety of it next to the sea was a light, running sand, and of little worth. The inconvenience was in it, that the sea brought so much sand and ooze and seaweed that these choked up the passage for the water to go out, insomuch that I am of opinion that if the sea had not broke in there would have been no current left for the water to go out, so that in time it would have laid to the sea, or else the sea would have drowned the whole country. Therefore, in my opinion, it is not good meddling with a haven so near the main ocean."

This experiment had cost in all £7,000, when the sea broke in ten years later, and Sir Hugh Myddelton's fields once more became harbour-bottom, and cockles and winkles once more grew where his meagre crops of oats and rape had struggled for existence. Some years later an offer was made to repair the dam for £4,400, but this fell through. No one thought it worth while to spend the money, though small arms and creeks of the harbour were from time to time banked off and reclaimed by adjacent landowners. The attempt which had baffled Sir Hugh Myddelton was suddenly revived by the Liberator directors seventeen years ago. The sea was banked out, almost on the lines of Sir Hugh Myddelton's dam, a straight channel of double the size necessary for the mere drainage of the higher levels was cut for the passage of the river and the holding of its waters during high-tide, when the sluices are automatically closed ; and a railway and quay were added, with a hotel at Bembridge. Solid and costly as their embankment was, the sea broke in, steam-engines and machinery were toppled from the dvkes and buried in the mud, workmen were drowned, and the whole enterprise was within an ace of becoming a little Panama. But at last the sea was beaten, 643 acres of weltering mud were left above water, and the reclamation, such as it is, is probably won for ever. But at what a cost ! Four hundred and twenty thousand pounds are debited to Barading reclamation, of which vast sum we may assume that £100,000 were expended on the railway quay and buildings, leaving £320,000 as the price of 643 acres of sea-bottom.

As reclamation of mud-flats and foreshores has lately been much advocated as a means of providing " work and wages," and of adding to the resources of the country, the present state and probable future of the land won from the sea at Brading is a matter of some interest, omitting all considerations of the original cost. We may concede at once that, from the picturesque point of view, the reclaimed harbour is a great improvement on the ancient mud-flats. It has added to the Isle of Wight what seems a piece of Holland, covered with green pasture and grazing cattle. This area is as much withdrawn from the intrusion of man as the old lagoon ; for as on the mud-flats there were no roads, no rights-of-way, and no footpaths, so the reclamation is a roadless district, secured absolutely to the use of the occupiers, and incidentally to the wild-fowl which swarm by its shallow pools and drains. The broad embanked river runs straight through the centre, and divides into two the level which lies like a green sea between the ring of surrounding hills and the harbour-bank. In this river, the waters of the ancient reclamations higher up the valley collect during high-water, when the pressure from the sea automatically shuts the sluices, and pour out during low-tide, when the pressure of the sea is removed, through the iron gates, near which lie, with the grooves still sound and sharply cut, parts of the sluices made for Sir Hugh Myddelton of English oak in the year 1621. The general shape of the reclamation is an oval, with one of the smaller ends facing the sea and the other abutting on ancient dams near Brading, two miles higher up the valley. The whole of this has been converted into firm, dry land ; neither is its quality so inferior as Sir Hugh Myddelton judged. Possibly the improvement in the seventeen years during which the old sea-bottom has been exposed to sun and rain, has been proportionately more rapid than in the ten in which it was exposed to the air after 1620. Then half the area was described as consisting of " light, running sand of little worth," though the upper portion promised to become valuable pasture. Those advocates of reclamation of land from the sea, who propose to " leave it to Nature " when the sea has once been barred out, can see at Brading and Bembridge what it is exactly that Nature does, and how far art can help to make old sea-bottom into pasture for cattle, and even into a playground for men and women, in seventeen years. It must be remembered that in this case Nature has been hurried, and made to do her work before her time. Left to itself, the harbour would have silted up in the course of centuries, and the pastures would have grown of themselves on land already covered with the alluvial mould. As it is, the sea was swept trom the land, which had to take its chance as it was—mud, sand, shingle, or cockle-beds, just as they came. There was not even an earthworm on the whole six hundred acres to move the soil and help the rain to wash the salt out of it. The wonder is not that the change has taken place so slowly, but that the change from a soil supporting marine vegetable growth to a soil largely covered with grass, clover, and trefoil, has matured so quickly. What was once the head of the bay is now good pasture covered with cattle and letting for 30s. an acre—there are one hundred and fifty acres of this good ground. Nature had already prepared it in part—for it was mud washed from the valley above—and still preserves in contour, though covered with grass, the creeks and " fleets " in which the tide rose and fell. All round the fringes of the flat, where it joins the old shore, the earthworms have descended and made a border of fair soil. On one side sewage has been run into the hungrier soil, and there, on a natural level, the true use and place of such experiments is seen. Three crops of grass a year are cut from ground which otherwise would not fetch more than 53. an acre a hint, perhaps, for the disposal of some of the London "effluent." There remains a portion of dead, sour greensand on which no herbage grows, though the advance of soil and grass may be noted, like the gradual spread of lichen on a tree. Each patch of rushes, each weed and plantain, gathers a little soil round its roots or leaves, and the oasis spreads until all is joined and made one with the better ground. A cattle-farm and nursery garden occupy the centre of the seaward curve. The farm is already surrounded by rich grasses, clover, and sweet herbage, and the garden is a wonder of fertility. Not only vegetables, but roses, chrysanthemums, carnations, lavender, and other garden flowers are there reared in profusion ; and in the winter masses of mauve veronica are in blossom. In walking over what is now good pasture, the evidences of the recent nature of all this agricultural fertility crop up on every side. Where the turf lies in knolls and hillocks, the sea-shells may still be seen lying bleached or purple among the roots of the grass, and what would be taken for snail-shells elsewhere are found to be little clusters of the periwinkles and mussels for which Brading Haven was once famous. But perhaps the greatest success in the conversion of the old harbour to daily use is the present condition of the " light, running sand" near the sea. This sand must have a stratum of clay beneath it, for groves of poplar trees planted on it are now in vigorous growth. But for some years the land lay barely covered with cup-moss, lichen, and thin, poor grass, a haunt of rabbits and shore-birds. It is now converted into a golf-ground, and studded at short intervals with level lawns of fine turf for " putting greens," which daily extend their area, and promise before long to convert the " running sands " into a beautiful and park- like recreation ground. The beauty of the whole scene is much increased by the number of half-wild swans, which are constantly in movement, either swimming upon the pools and streams, or flying to and from the sea. These swans are among the natural agents busied in aiding the reclamation of the land. They feed almost entirely upon the weeds which would otherwise choke up the dykes, and it is believed that two
swans do as much work in keeping the waterways free and open as could be done by a paid labourer.
The history and fortunes of a given area of land are the constant subject of story. The rise and fall of the importance of a particular part of the sea, except perhaps as constituting a fishery, has seldom been made the theme of a historian. Yet there are certain areas of sea off the English coasts which have an average population much greater than that of the adjacent land, and have maintained this pre-eminence for centuries. There are the great roadsteads off the English coasts, places in which ships and their crews congregate as naturally for food, shelter, or refit, as do the sea-fowl off certain parts of the coast. The proximity of a great harbour is not a necessary feature of such roadsteads. The fleets of vessels which in certain winds lie off the " Downs " in the Channel have little or no communication with the shore. But usually the roadstead lies off a harbour, and the permanence of the port makes the occupation of the adjacent sea a matter of course, so long as the harbour continues to be used. For some reason this has not been the case at Portsmouth and Spithead.

St. Helen's Roads, off St. Helen's Point, and opposite the mouth of the old Brading Haven, now Bembridge Harbour, was once the favourite anchoring ground of the British fleets when about to leave for foreign service ; and their communications with the island were almost as frequent and important as with Portsmouth itself. The fleets used to leave Spithead and anchor off St. Helen's, sending to Bembridge, at the point where a spring of fresh water runs down from the sloping cliff to the sea, to fill their water casks, and to the little village of Bembridge itself for their fresh meat, so long as they remained, which was taken out daily to the ships in " row-barges." Hence the old inn was originally called the " Row-Barge " and the country people, farmers, and village tradesfolk profited greatly by the presence of the fleet. For a time the Isle of Wight held the place for which it seemed naturally suited in those days, of a victualling-ground for the minor needs of the fleet. Sir John Oglander, long before this, had foreseen this possibility, though he did not expect the development which brought the ships to the mouth of the harbour which lay almost in touch with his own park at Nunwell. He proposed that a new port and road should be made at Cowes for a "rendezvous." "If the country would have so much discretion as to make good use of that harbour, as first to have an honest man to be captain there, to build storehouses, to have by a joint store of all provision, and to have that their rendezvous, and to victuall there, they need no other market nor means to make the island happy and fortunate."
The first account of a British fleet lying for a long period off St. Helen's is preserved in the Fleming Collection at Rydal Hall, and gives the list of ships and " order of array " for an expected battle with the French in 1545. Henry VIII. , only two years before his death, drifted into war with both France and Scotland on the burning question of the betrothal of the baby princess, Mary Oueen of Scots, to Edward the Prince of Wales. Henry was at that time in the position of a tenant for life of a large estate, who has exhausted the savings of his ancestors and his own credit. He had only two more vears to live, but the national, or rather the royal, exchequer was drained. All his father's savings were spent. The whole of the Church property had already been sold in the greatest possible hurry at the lowest possible price. The last financial expedient of debasing the coinage till the proportion of base metal was as four to six, had brought nothing in, and destroyed credit; and Henry, in his old age, found himself threatened with a French invasion, and without means to equip a sufficient fleet.

Brading Haven Reclamation Scheme.— During the few years the works in connection with the above scheme have been in progress, there have not been wanting those ready to express a donbt as to Mr. Seymour or anyone else having the power of bringing such a work to a successful termination.

The idea of reclaiming the extensive mudflats, which for years hare only been haunted by the " winkle picker," originated with Mr. E J. H.

The railway to Bembridge also will open up one of the most lovely, though hitherto neglected, spots in the Island. A few years will probably convert this little village into a town, and then the company who have displayed so much enterprise will receive a fitting reward.

The Reclamation of  Haven.— After many ominous shakes of the head from people residing in the locality of St. Helen's, there can be no doubt that Mr. Seymour has successfully completed the task of keeping back the water from the extensive mud flats which for years have furnished such capital spots for the " winkler " aud the fowler. The idea of reclaiming the extensive tract of submerged laud called  Haven, originated with Mr. R J. H. Saunders, C.E., who succeeded in forming a company to provide the requisite capital. No trifling amount was required, for already the amount expended has reached the formidable sum of £80, 000. For this investment the company have some 700 acres of land, and although at present this does not look very promising, there can be little doubt that, in a few years time, there will be a good return from it. At the top of the harbour are what are known as the marshes, a tract of low land which has evidently been at some period reclaimed from the sea by an embankment, and this is stated to be one of tho best pieces of grazing land in the Wight. The farmers say that it fattens beasts extremely well, and some consider this is owing to the salt which still remains in the land. There is every hope, therefore, that in a few years' time the land now reclaimed will be equally good. But the reclamation of the harbour was by no means the whole of the company's scheme. They are now constructing a railway to St. Helen's and Bembridge, and a large portion of the embarking work will also serve to carry the railway. Bembridge is at present a locality very little visited, owing to the difficulty and trouble of reaching it. Horses and carriages have had to go a long way round to get to it. and the pedestrian from Ryde could only shorten the route by crossing a ferry at St. Helen's. Nevertheless, Bembridge is one of the prettiest little places in the Island, and very healthy. Already a number of gentry have settled there, and when it is connected with the other parts of the Island by rail, it will probably soon arrive at the dignity of a town, and the company, who have shown so much enterprise, will reap a rich reward.

Could old Sir Hugh Middleton re-visit this earth and again cast his eyes over the watery expanse that lays beyond "ye ancient borough of Bradinge," he would find the desire of his heart accomplished. For two years the navvy has been toiling away St. Helens and Bembridge ; and strong and able workmen under the able direction of Mr. Frederick Seymour have devoted their minds and bodies to one object—to reclaim Brading Haven from the sea. On Thursday last that work was accomplished and over eight hundred acres of what will in the course of a few years be probably fine pasture land were reclaimed from the sea. This land will be the property of the Brading Haven Reclamation Company ; and imagine that its value will more than equal the cost the reclamation. We cordially congratulate Mr Frederick Seymour in having brought so arduous an undertaking to successful termination. The name this gentleman will be handed down to posterity as the one who carried out the mightiest engineering work ever done in this island. Not merely has this gentleman reclaimed 80 acres of land, but the inhabitants of Bembridge and St. Helens have been greatly benefitted by his enterprise in other matters; and we hope that he will meet with substantial recompense for the great work he has accomplished. The Isle Wight is larger by over 800 acres than it was when we went to press last week.— *Ryde Newspaper.* [Mr. F. Seymour has many friends in Jersey].

Reclamation of Brading Harbour.— A correspondent of the Building News writes to say that the arduous work of reclaiming Brading Harbour, which haa been carried on with unremitting diligence during the last two or three years, has now terminated successfully, and an immense tract of what we hope will be ere long arable land added to the Island.

Novel Cricket Match.— On Saturday last a cricket match was played between members of the Brading Cricket Club and a team selected from tbe men employed by Mr. Seymour, the contractor, who has curried out the reclamation works, at Brading Harbour. The match was less remarkable as a display of skill, than from the fact that it was played upou ground till recently covered by the sea, and hardly yet firm enough to enable a good match to be played. The Brading team won easily, but a considerable number of persons assembled, more curious it appeared as to the firmness of the ground than the ability of the cricketers.

Bembridge and its Prospects. —Our correspondent writes as follows :— I paid a visit to this little village on Tuesday on the occasion of the annual regatta, and was surprised at the change which a few years had made in the locality. Situated at the extreme eastern end of the Island, and cut off from communication with Ryde by the harbour, it has hitherto been so difficult of access as to be quite out of the way of the general tourist and traveller . All this is being altered, and in a few months Bembridge will be as accessible as any other watering place in the Island. Desirous of examining the effects of the new reclamation works which keep back the water from what used to be " Brading Harbour," I walked from Brading to Bembridge along the old shore. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen's side, just above the Mill, and terminating on the Bembridge aide near the Point. The sea is effectually kept out, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, the "harbour" now appears to be a brown and barren waste. As the mud banks have dried they I have cracked, and are covered with large fissures. Thousands of oookles, winkles, and sea weeds have come to a dry death in consequenoe of the reclamation, and their dried shells, which smell rather offensively, can be found by hundreds by scraping the surface of the banks. It will not be many years, however, before smiling green fields will make the inhabitants forget that this extensive tract was once covered with water. Here and there a blade of grass, hardier than its fellows, can already be seen sprouting. The new railway runs from the Brading Station by the side of what was the Harbour to St. Helen's Mill, and will cross to Bembridge on the embankment. I noticed that there was still a good deal of water behind the embankment. This is fresh water, brought down by the River Yar, and flows through large flood gates up to the sea. On entering the village I saw a great change even within the last two years. A speculative gentleman, who had great faith in the place, many years ago built a large hotel and a number ot houses, but, no doubt owing to the difficulty of getting to the place, these remained empty for a number of years. I noticed, however, that all the houses were now let, and that a number of visitors were walking about. With a railway brought close to it, I have not the slightest doubt that before many years are past Bembridge will rival Sandown and Shanklin. The arboreal beauties of the place are most striking. Avenues of trees shelter the roads, and the pathway to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of Shanklin Chine. The beach is as good as that of Sandown, and protected by a reef of rocks. Altogether there seems some justification for the inhabitants waking up to a sense of the long-neglected beauties of the locality, and indulging in the confident hope that their prosperous days are at hand.

```{admonition} BEMBRIDGE AND ITS REGATTA. - Saturday, August 30th, 1879
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790830/017/0006), 1879-08-30, p. 6

Although the guide books acknowledge the picturesque beauties of the "little village of Bembridge," they also complain of the difficulty of access to it. There have been hitherto no better means of reaching it from Ryde than taking a carriage or walking along the road to St. Helen's, and then crossing the mouth of the harbour at the ferry. This is so very awkward a route, and so extremely hilly, that Bembridge has remained till within the last year or so one of the most out-of-the-way places in the Island. On paying the place a visit on Tuesday, however, we were astonished at the change which about two years had made in the appearance of the locality. This change was almost entirely due to the new reclamation and railway works, which are still incomplete. Arriving at Brading by train, we took the opportunity of getting from thence to Bembridge by skirting along the shores of what used to be Brading Harbour. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen's side just above the water mill, and terminating on the Bembridge side near the Point. This effectually keeps out the sea, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, Brading "Harbour" has now the appearance of a desert. The mud-flats are all dried — at least as far as the surface is concerned, — but, remembering certain awful warnings of people who had sunk into treacherous mud up to their knees, we did not venture far. The banks as they have dried have cracked, and are covered with extensive fissures that do not add to their beauty. It has been a sad time for the winkles, cockles, and sea plants. In some sandy places, on scraping the surface, scores of cockles which had been dried up in their shells were found, while there were numerous winkles and sea weed which had met a like sad fate. Through the centre of the reclaimed banks flows a rather large stream called the Yar. It is a curious fact that there are two streams in the Island which go by this name, and this causes some confusion in the minds of the tourists. The stream has been the principal difficulty in carrying out the work, and an exit had to be provided for it by means of flood gates. In a few years time the appearance of the reclaimed land will be as pleasing as it is now the reverse. Nature soon throws her green mantle over the most desolate-looking spots, if there is plenty of water, and doubtless in a few years the inhabitants, viewing the green meadows here, will almost forget that they were once covered by the sea. Even now in some places a blade or two of grass may be seen shooting up. There is little doubt that centuries ago this harbour consisted of smiling fields, upon which the sea burst, either suddenly or by degrees, till 700 acres were covered. In the interesting account of the unsuccessful reclamation by Sir Hugh Middleton, it is stated that in the centre of the harbour a well was found, proving the truth of our statement. The new railway runs by the side of the harbour as far as the mill, and will then cross the embankment to Bembridge, where a station is in course of erection. On entering the village we were struck with the alteration in the appearance of the place, which seemed waking up to a sense of its own importance. The shops had been enlarged and the once desolate looking hotel was occupied. Bembridge happened to have been visited some 30 years ago by one of those unfortunate individuals who " live before their time." Charmed with the beauty of the place, he thought that nothing more was necessary to attract visitors here than to provide accommodation for them. He built a large hotel, and speculated in building, but empty house property soon showed him that something more than natural beauty was required to induce people to reside here. We noticed, however, that all the houses now appeared full, and unmistakable visitors were walking about. A stroll through the place convinced us that it would not be many years before Bembridge would rival Shanklin and Sandown. It has a beach hardly inferior to the latter, and the approach to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of the celebrated chine of the former. Its arboreal beauty is the chief cha- racteristic of tne village, which nas some of the most lovely avenues we have ever seen. No doubt we saw the village at its best on Tuesday, that being the second day of the regatta.

—Between the Bembridge and St. Helen's Cliffs, at the Isle Wight, the sea entered and formed a lake known Brading Harbour, covering area of about 900 acres. A company has been formed for the purpose of constructing a railway from the Isle of Wight Railway Company's main line to St Helen's and across the mouth of the harbour to Bembridge. The work is being carried out by Mr Seymour, contractor, and after a number attempts the tide has been completely shut out of the harbour by a thick embankment taken across from St. Helen's to Bembridge, and the land reclaimed is bo used for farming, and building purposes.

The Reclamation or the Harbour.

The company who have been carrying out the new reclamation works at the mouth of Brading Harbour have met with a most serious reverse. The high tides a few days ago made a breach in the embankment, which has been gradually getting larger and larger, and now the sea has resumd its sway over the whole extent of mud flats which had been dry for some months, and vessels actually go up to the quay at Brading again for chalk. The railway which runs by the side of the harbour is also covered at high tide, and on taking a walk over it on Sunday we noticed that the rails were covered with seaweed, and that sand and shingle were banking up round it in some places. The extent of embankment washed away, in spite of every exertion, is said to be over 70 feet. The work of restoration was put in hand immediately after the breach, and the work is being prosecuted most vigorously, but we understand the embankment will take a different course, so as to avoid the heavy sea wbich runs, in here occasionally.

The Reclamation Works.—

We last Monday paid a visit to the reclamation works at Brading Harbour, and found that the damage which had been done there was quite as great as had been reported. There was one part of the embankment, near the Bembridge side, which had to bear the brunt of the heavy sea which rolls in here. The embankment was sound enough, but nothing had been placed on its sides to keep the sand down in its place. The result was that the extraordinary high tide of a fortnight since washed over it, wetted the sand, which flowed away from the embankment like so much water. In a very short time a breach was made, and the sea had such a hold that it was impossible to stop it. The breach has since reached some 70 yards in width, and the sea has covered the whole of the harbour just the same as it did before the embankment was made. Vessels now come up and down the harbour to Brading Quay for chalk as if nothing had ever happened to check them. On walking down the side of the harbour we noticed that in several places the sea had covered the railway, and that the seaweed had washed over the rails, while the sand and shingle had silted up round them. It is, of course, of the utmost importance that the work should be put right, and a number of men are now at work re-making the embankment, which, we believe, will cross the harbour at a different point than it did before. Mr. Seymour has entered into a fresh contract to complete the work, and it is rumoured that his estimate of the cost of the new work required is £10,000. Mr. R. J. H. Saunders, the engineer of the company, writing to a contemporary, thus explains the cause of the accident : " You will, no doubt, have heard that the extraordinary tide of last Friday night passed over the unfinished work at Bembridge, and within a very few hours a breach was made in the embankment so that the sea now flows again over the land reclaimed in June last. This is, of course, very disappointing, as the work was nearly completed along the whole length, and was everywhere considerably higher than the previous extraordinary tide. There was, therefore, no apprehension or thought of danger, and consequently no precautions were taken. This will, however, be a warning in the future to make assurance doubly sure, and to leave no point undefended. You will be pleased to learn that the work of restoration has already been put in hand. The directors were over the works yesterday with Mr. Grantham, the consulting engineer of the company, when, after very careful consideration of the whole question, it was unhesitatingly decided to prosecute the work vigorously, and an agreement was entered into for carrying it out at once with Mr. F. Seymour, the contractor, and I have every reason to believe I shall within two or three months have the satisfaction of informing you that the sea has been effectually shut out."

```{admonition} SHANKLIN RIOTS. - Saturday, April 10th, 1880
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18800410/013/0006), 1880-04-10, p. 6

The Electors of Shanklin are requested to read the undermentioned facts: 1. That on the 17th day of March, a meeting of Mr. Cotton's constituents was held in the Assembly Rooms, in Shanklin, and a large number of Mr. Ashley's supporters attended the meeting and prevented Mr. Cotton and other speakers from being heard, by hooting, yelling, and creating a disturbance throughout the whole of the proceedings ; and it was evident that it was the predetermined intention of Mr. Ashley's supporters to prevent Mr. Cotton having a hearing, and not to treat him with the respect which candidates have a right to expect from their audience on such occasions. 2. That a few nights after the meeting the glass in the house and conservatory of Mr. Coster, a gentleman of Conservative principles, were smashed, that gentleman being absent from the Island at the time. 3. A meeting of Mr. Ashley's supporters was held on the 2nd of April, and at which meeting the supporters of Mr. Cotton from Ventnor, Sandown, St. Helen's, and other places were present, the men from St. Helen's being chiefly of the labouring classes ; they arrived at Shanklin two hours previous to the meeting, in the open day ; this fact was well known to Mr. Ashley's committee, and no communication as to the presence of these men or their attendance at the meeting was made to Mr. Cotton's committee. The men behaved themselves respectably and orderly prior to their going to the meeting, and when in the hall had no weapons, nor appeared to be prepared for a disturbance, but, on the contrary, the sup- porters of Mr. Ashley appeared in the hall armed with bludgeons, short lengths of gas pipe, and other dangerous weapons, and evidently intent upon creating a serious riot. 4. That about 7.30, as Mr. Dampier-Child approached the Institute, he met a crowd of disorderly people, and was struck on the head by a missile. He went to Capt. Harvey's house to warn him that a disturbance was likely to take place. Capt. Harvey, not supposing a disturbance was likely to occur, persuaded Mr. Dampier-Child to accompany him and another gentleman to Mr. Cotton s committee rooms. Just prior to arriving there they were surrounded and attacked by a mob of over 1 00 persons, residents of Shanklin, who threatened to take their lives. Mr. Dampier-Child and the other gentleman were knocked down and kicked senseless whilst ou the ground, and Capt. Harvey escaped from the crowd after being severely handled and receiving some heavy blows. It must be distinctly understood this riot took place before the time fixed for Mr. Ashley's meeting, and that this mob of Mr. Ashley's supporters had some time previously assembled, armed as before mentioned, with the intention ot creating a most serious riot. 5. That, in consequence of this not, many supporters of Mr. Ashley advised Col. Atherley, the Chairman, not to hold a meeting that night, for if he did serious consequences would ensue ; but eventually, about 8.30, the doors were opened, and it is certain that by this time the men from St. Helen's had heard of the riot out of doors, and that one of the gentlemen who had been seriously injured in the riot was oue who was much respected amongst them. 6. That as soon as Col. Atherley appeared interruptions took place, by singing. A gentleman, also much respected by the St. Helen's men, got up in a chair and informed Col. Atherley that if he would withdraw he thought he could obtain a quiet bearing for Mr. Ashley, the gentleman's chair was immediately whipped from under him, and he was thrown on the floor by some of Mr. Ashley's supporters. He got up again to carry his intention, the chair was again whipped from under him; and this time a most dangerous wound was inflicted on his head by some supporter of Mr. Ashley striking him from behind. Hereupon a riot ensued, but how long it continued the committee are not aware. The St. Helen's men were met by several persons leaving Shanklin, about 9 o'clock, in an orderly manner, not offending any one, and, so far as Mr. Cotton's committee can learn, no damage was done to the person or property of any one in Shanklin by Mr. Cotton's supporters; whilst on the other hand, four gentle- men were assaulted aud three of them seriously injured by cowardly attacks from Mr. Ashley's mob, who continued to do injury to property by breaking windows, &c., until after midnight. The Committee offer these facts to the inhabitants of Shanklin and of the Isle of Wight generally, without any comment. H. HARRIS, Chairman, Mr. Cotton's Committee, Shanklin

ANSWER TO THE CHARGE OF TORY RUFFIANISM IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

A True Account oj the late Riot at Shanklin from ihe commencement. It will be remembered that a short time since, Mr. B. T. Cotton held a meeting at Shanklin, and attempted to deliver an address to the electors, but the disturbance in the Hall was so great that he was unable to obtain a hearing, one of the ringleaders of the disturbance being the servant of Col. Atherley. On Friday last, a meeting was announced by the Hon. Evelyn Ashley, to be given at Shanklin, when doubtless bearing in mind the recep- tion given to Mr. Cotton, by the Liberals, some of tne Conservatives, aa private individuals, and not by the instructions of any person, determined to give the would- be Liberal member and the gallant Colonel a similar re- ception to Mr. Cotton's. Thus far the cause of the Tories assembling is shewn, but the pamphlet which has been extensively circulated purporting to have been written by " One who was there," relates nothing of the rioting which took place before the meeting commenced. The electors shall bo shown how the gentle Shanklin Liberals treated gentle- men as they were quietly walking through th 3 streets. Mr. Latimer Saunders, Captain Harvey, and Mr. Dampier Child were walking through the High-street of Shanklin, about an hour before the Liberal meeting commenced, when they were set upon by a party of Liberal roughs and knocked down. Mr. L. Saunders had two teeth knocked out ; Mr. Dampier Child a rib broken, and all three gentlemen were severely bruised all over their bodies. I shall say nothing about the damage committed on Capt. Harvey's house and property, or the serious assault perpetrated on him, as I saw nothing of the matter, but will give you aa account of the meeting. On the doors of the Hall being opened, the front seats were taken by about twenty respectable youag men belonging to Ryde ; these were followed by a number of Shanklin men, all of them having sticks in their hands, with the exception of one, he evideatly;ieader of the Shanklin party, and well known to the Ryde men, haying formerly been employed in Ryde, was armed with a piece of Iron, it having the appearance of having been cut off a gas pipe. After these had been in the Hall a little while, a tremendous cheering was heard outside, and the so-called " gang of hired ruffians " made their appearance. Of course a scene of considerable confusion ensued for some time, the Liberals cheering Ashley, and the Conservative giving cheers for Cotton, interspersed with cries of " Wno sacked the Bobby!''" After this had continued for some time a message was seat from the platform to Mr. R. Seymour, asking him if he could quiet his men, the reply was sent back that if the Chair- man would allow him to speak from the platform where he could be seen and heard, he would do his best to quiet the men. This very reasonable request was refused. Mr. Seymour then attempted to gain the men's attention by standing on a chair, when before he could address them the chair was pulled from under him, when of course he fell on the floor. (About this time Mr. Ashley and the Chairman left the Hall.) Mr. Seymour no way daunted by his futile effort to gain a hearing, stood upon another chair and again tried to quiet the men, and again the chair was pulled from under him, this time causing him to fall on his head. This was the signal for the rioting inside the Hall to commence, the person who pulled the chair away being levelled by a chair striking him on the head. A tall dark gentleman then sprang from the platform and commenced striking among the navvies right and left. Of course this was not borne with very long, one of them behind rushing to the front and seizing the striker, forced the stick from him and paid him back in his own coin. A general fight now ensued, the navvies being without any weapons but those with which nature had provided tham, breaking un the chairs in the Hall and thereby obtaining some. I think this will do away with the assertion of '" One who was there," that the navvies were armed with bars of iron and bludgeons, for if they had had these weapons there would have been no need for them to have taken the trouble to break up the chairs to arm themselves with. I left the Hall upon seeing the fight that was going on, and joined a crowd of about five hund-ed people who were assembled outside. I had been there about five minutes when the leader of the Shanklin roughs with his bar of iron in his hand appeared on the steps, wildly waving his arms, and shouting "All Shanklin men inside." As no one responded to this call I suppose all the Shanklin men were inside, or else that there were no men in Shanklin. Of course when the navvies came out of the Hall they presented a somewhat different appearance to what they did when they entered it each one being armed with the leg or some portion oi a chair, so I suppose they had left their bars of iron and bludgeons behind them. No doubt they may have had some drink before entering, and also upon leavin- the Hall, but it was in the same way as the writer of this had it, and that was by paying for it from their own pockets; they were perfectly sober. The last I saw of the navvies they were marching on the Sandown-road with a crowd keeping at a respectable distance, pelting them with stones. Of course the heads of the Liberal party will try to make capital out of this affair, but there is not the slightest doubt that if Mr. Seymour had not been assaulted there would have been no riot.

Mr. Frederick Seymour, contractor for the Brading Haven reclamation and railway works, writes to deny that he was the instigator and leader of the disturbance at Mr. Evelyn Ashley's meeting on Saturday. He adds that he left the island on Wednesday and did not return until late on Saturday night, and that he totally disagrees with such disgraceful conduct.

```{admonition} RECLAIMING LAND FROM THE SEA. - Saturday, April 17th, 1880
:class: note dropdown

[Illustrated London News](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001578/18800417/112/0018), 1880-04-17, p. 17-8

Our Engraving represents a view of the entrance to Brading Haven, Isle of Wight, at low water, and a portion the new embankment recently constructed to reclaim the Haven from the sea. It was until recently a large tract marshy ground, with a bold inlet of the sea, at high water, covering all the low lands between Bembridge and St. Helen’s, about eight to nine hundred acres being overflowed by the sea every tide. Originally this marshy ground was greater extent; but a portion was reclaimed in the reign Edward I. by Sir William Bessel, then warden the island. In 1594 German Richards, Esq., made an acquisition mill, marsh, and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge. In the reign of James I. an attempt on a grand scale was made by Sir Hugh Myddleton to inclose, and recover the haven from the sea; but after an expenditure of £7000 it was discovered that much of the recovered land was a light, running sand; and, finally, after various experiments, the project came to disastrous issue. In April, 1877, the “Brading Haven Reclamation Company accepted a tender of Mr. Frederick Seymour, of Bembridge (who had previously constructed the railway from Brading to St. Helen’s), for the construction of an embankment to reclaim the land contained in the Haven; which arduous work was successfully completed on Feb. 22 last, thus adding 800 acres of valuable land to the Isle of Wight. It is intended to continue the railway on the new embankment (which is one mile in length) from St. Helen’s to Bembridge. As, doubtless, many of our readers know, Bembridge is a village of great beauty, clothed in leaf and shade, nestling at the foot of Bembridge Down. It is an extremely picturesque spot, but, having previously been out of the ordinary track, has attracted but little notice. It is, however, well worthy of a visit, and its many retired nooks afford capital accommodation for picnics. Its sands, too, are firm and smooth, and offer good opportunities for sea-bathing. The view from the summit of Bembridge Down is the finest in the island. To the north the eye looks over the gently swelling grounds of St. Helen’s and sea view to Ryde; and, when glancing over the Solent, with fits majestic ships, commands the harbour of Portsmouth, Hayling Island, and the line of the Hampshire and Sussex coasts, where the slender spire of Chichester Cathedral may be seen pointing heavenwards —while the coast terminates in the blue haze which marks the position of Beaohy Head. To the south is beheld Sandown Bay, with its loamy cliffs alternately rising and sinking, until they tower in the gigantic mass of Dunmore and Shank!in Down. To the west the eye commands a wide view of the inland hills and valleys ; immediately below, the Yar winds its sinuous way through the green pastures of Brading Haven. Now that the land has been reclaimed and the facilities for reaching Bembridge are improved, in all probability this will become one of the favourite watering places in the Isle of Wight.

ASSAULT

George Stickley, in the employ of the Reclamation Company, at St. Helen's, was summoned for assaulting Henry Smith, of St. Helen's.— Mr. Thirkell, who appeared for the complainant, said that defendant was the treasurer of a sick fund for the men employed on the Brading Harbour Works. There was a meeting on Monday, the 9th, at which complainant attended, and defendant's books were gone through by Mr. R. Seymour, the time keeper. It was then found that defendant had not accounted for several sums which had been paid to him by the cashier for the past nine months. On Friday, the 11th, the complainant, in company with another, went to defendant and demanded an account of the the sums which had been paid in by the cashier, a list of which was handed to defendant. Defendant became very abusive and assaulted him in a very violent manner.— Complainant stated that when he went to defendant under the circumstances detailed, defendant struck him with his fist on the temple and almost rendered him insensible. — The other evidence given was rather contradictory, a witness called by defendant asserting that very high words passed between the two parties in the course of which complainant put his fist in defendant's face.

Discovery of Roman Villa at Brading, including a mosaic of Orpheus playing lyre.

Discovery of a Roman Villa near Brading.

An addition has been recently made to the historical attractions of the Isle of Wight by the discovery of Roman Villa at Moreton Farm, near Brading. The remains disclosed have already excited considerable interest among archaeologists, and it has been suggested by some of the Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London that further excavations be undertaken in order to ascertain the extent of the building or buildings, only a portion of which has been yet discovered. The first discovery of the villa is due to Captain Thorpe, of Yarbridge, near Brading, whose acquaintance with the neighbourhood led him to investigations which have proved to be of considerable interest in their connexion with the early history and occupation of the island. Some accounts of these preliminary explorations bave been published. The external walls, at present cleared, measure about 52ft. by 37ft., and enclose about six or seven chambers, with passages, connected, there is reason to believe, with others. In addition to tessellated floors, remains of hypocausts, flues, fresco paintings, roofing tiles, coins, pottery, and other interesting relics, there are the remains of a mosaic pavement, with design upon it of unusual character, and one which is worthy of careful study and attention. The design, though grotesque, is doubtless symbolical, and may be connected either with the mythology of the ancients or the early introduction of Christianity. Its interpretation is not here attempted. Other decorated floors are known to exist the vicinity, and these, when properly examined, may assist in the explanation. The remains evidently cover a large area, much of which under cultivation, but every facility for investigation has been accorded by Lady Oglander, the owner of the land, and Mr. Cooper, the present occupier. Excavations have been accordingly renewed, and are at present under the direction of Mr. John E. Price, F.S.A., and Mr. F. G. Hilton Price, F.G.S. Work was commenced last week, and already a new chamber has been opened up, enclosing an interesting mosaic, the central design of which is a representation of Orpheus playing on the lyre, and surrounded by animals, as usual. The border is an unusually good example of what known as the guilloche pattern. Pottery, glass, and coins have been also found ; among the latter several third brass of the reign of Victorious, a.d. 268. These investigations are important in their relation to the occupation of the island by the Romans. It has been said that the dark hair and brilliant eyes of the veritable natives are due to the Italian colonists. Its annexation to the Imperial power, due to Vespasian, in the first century, and its association in the third century with the fortunes of Carausius and Allectus, are indications of prolonged connection with tho Empire, yet the historians of old are silent as to the rinding of remains. Some, indeed, speak of them unknown. Of late years, however, the contrary ins been amply proved, and it is import tant that all Mich discoveries as the present should be carefully studied and described Inscriptions or other data may yet bo found which may shed considerable light what is already known the history the Isle of Wight during the Roman colonisation.

 to chronicle the Haven " us a large tract of marshy ground, containing 856 acres, covered every tide by the sea." The recovery of so large a piece of land from the sea had been long an object in contemplation, aud Sir John Oglander had preserved accounts of several undertakings for this purpose. A part of Brading Haven was taken in by Sir William Russell, Lord of Yaverland (Warder of the Isle of Wight, in the reign of Edward I.), at the time when Yarbridge was erected. In the year 1562, another parcel of land was walled in from the sea by Mr George Oglander aud Mr German Richards, when the North-marsh and some adjoining lands qere gained, and in 1594 a third acquisition was made of Mill-marsh and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge by Mr Edward Richards. The next attempt was of a more extensive nature ; a grant ot the Haven was obtained from King James the 1st, by Gibbs, a groom of the bed chamber. The owners of the adjoining lands contested this grant, which the King was very earnest in supporting. After a verdict obtained in the exchequer against the gentlemen of the Island, Gibbs sold his share for £2000 to Sir Bevis Thelwwall, a page of the King's bed chamber, who admitted the famous sir Hugh Miiddletou to a share from the sea. The first taking of it in cost £4000, and £1000 more were expended in building a dwelling house, barn, a watermill, trenching, quick setting, and other necessary works, so that, including the original purchase, the total expenditure amounted to £7000. But after all, the nature of the ground did not answer the expectations of the undertakers, for though that part of it adjoining Brading proved tolerably good, nearly one half of it was found to be a light running sand. Nevertheless as incontestible evidence appeared, by the discovery of a well cased with stone near the middle of the Haven, that it had formerly been good ground Sir Hugh Middleton tried a variety of experiments on the land which had been taken in before he sold his share, sowing it with wheat, barley, oats, cabbage, and finally with rape seed, which last was most successful. But the greatest discouragement was that the sea brought up so much ooze, weeds and sand, which choked up the passage for the discharge of the fresh water. At length, in a wet season, When the inner part of the Haven was full of water, and a high spring tide, the water met under the bank and made a breach. Thus ended this expensive project, and though Sir John Oglander, who lived in the neighbourhood confessed himself a friend to the undertaking, he declared it as his opinion that the scheme could never be resumed to any profitable purpose, and the following estimate in 1699 of the expenses necessary to recover it shews that the enclosing was again in contemplation :

May 10th, 1699.— The abstract of an estimate of the charge of taking in, draining, and securing of the Haven of Brading, &c.

The damme, or sea wall, will be best to stand near about where the old wall stood, with some difference in the range and variation of the line thereof.

Ths wall will contain in length about 3400 feet, and will be cheapest and best done,to consist of the nearest matter at hand, which is a strong stiff clay, with which is to be mingled some other proper material, the delivery, casting, filling, ramming, arming, and sufficiently defending and securing this wall will cost about six shillings per foot running, which amounts to 1020 0 0  
There must be two very substantial sluices which will cost the sum of £900 0 0  
The charge of utensils of all kinds my amouut to about 250 0 0  
The charge of closing and secutely shutting in of ihe old channel, which will be most difficult and troublesome work of the whole undertaking, will come to the sum of 1000 0 0  
The profit or recompense to the undertaker, whoever he may be, who shall be found able and successfully to design and execute the work, cannot in justice be less than the sum of 1000 0 0  
The total is £4170 0 0  
Hy. Sher, Surveyor.

We reprint the historian's record of 1781, and refer to the successful reclamation of the Haven in 1881, believing such will be interesting to our readers. We regret we cannot, as we should like to do, record the actual cost, and therefore beg our readers not to conclude the wonderful estimate of Hy. Sher, surveyor, of May 16th, 1699, has covered all. Doubtless the Englishmen had, or will have, before the accounts are totalled, a few extras, which the Dutchmen could not get a certificate for. We however, hope the Brading Harbour Reclamation Company have followed the wise advice of the old surveyor and made some difference in the range and valuation of the line of the wall, from the unfortunate lines of Sir Hugh Middleton and his partner. and that they have mingled with the clay used in their wall some other proper material, and may it prove the estimated profit or recompense of the old surveyor will be far exceeded.— Communicated.
