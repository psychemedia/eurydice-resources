TWO BODIES FOUND.

On Saturday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, two bodies were washed ashore near to Sir William Hutt's pier at Apley ; one of the bodies was headless, but a human head was found floating near the spot. The bodies were in a very advanced state of decomposition, and almost nude, so that there were no means of identification ; but there is little doubt that they were from the ill-fated Eurydice. Coffins were procured, and the bodies conveyed by the Coastguard to the mortuary at the Cemetery. At half-past 5 in the afternoon the funeral took place at the north side of the Cemetery. Palls were thrown over the coffins, which were carried, shoulder high, by eight Coastguardsmen, under the superintendence of Mr. Jefferys, the chief officer. They were met at the grave (both being interred in one) by Mr. Westhall, a gentleman residing in Ryde, who read portions of Scripture. and afterwards addressed the large concourse of people, remarking that it was a very solemn occasion, and took their thoughts back to the 24th March, when about 300 poor men and boys were drowned by the capsizing of the Eurydice; the bodies of two of them were in the coffins before them ; there were no names on the coffins, but the men were known to God. He nothing of their history, and he did not know whether they were Christians, and he had nothing to do with that. They were surrounded by mysteries ; even their own existence was a mystery, and it was a most mysterious thing that the poor creatures who were drowned would have been on land in about an hour, and would have boon welcomed by loving friends; but it was not to be. They could not understand it, but the light of eternity would interpret all mysteries, and all they had to do was to bow to the will of God, for would not the Judge of the whole earth do right? The lesson for all of them to learn was the uncertainty of human life. Those who were drowned were in good health and spirits a few minutes before, and then were called to their final account. There were these present who evidently had sympathy for those who had been thus taken suddenly away. Although they were taken thus suddenly, it was possible they might have been able to give one look to the Saviour, and there was life in a look. It did not take long to save the thief on the cross, and they might hope that many in the Eurydice were saved, and he was glad to believe that many on board loved the Saviour. Mr. Westhall concluded the simple, but very impressive, service by offering prayer and pronouncing the benediction. There was something exceedingly affecting in witnessing the two plain, nameless coffins placed in the grave, and no friends or relatives near to pay the last tribute of affection ; and also in the thought that until the morning of the resurrection it must remain a profound secret as to who was interred in Ryde Cemetery on Saturday afternoon.

HER MAJESTY'S SHIP " EURYDICE."

In the pretty cemetery of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, on Wednesday afternoon, Lady Isabel Atherley veiled a fine monument, which has been erected there by public subscription, to the officers and men who perished by the foundering of the *Eurydice* off Shanklin, in March, 1878. Seven of the bodies were buried in this cemetery, among them, as many suppose, the body of Captain Hare, the commander. The monument has been erected from a design furnished by Mr. F. J. Moynihan, of Uxbridge-road. Many persons were present to witness the ceremony, after which Lieutenant Langley, on behalf the Naval Service, thanked the people of Shanklin for erecting so worthy a memorial to the gallant men who had perished amid such lamentable circumstances.

UNVEILING OF THE "EURYDICE" MEMORIAL AT SHANKLIN.

The pretty cemetery given to the pariah of Shanklin by Colonel Atherley was on Wednesday the 23rd ult., the scene of an interesting and deeply-impressive ceremony—the unveiling of a monument erected there to the memory of the Crew of the "Eurydice," which, with its precious freitage of some 300 young sailors, was suddenly whelmed beneath the waves in the awful gale of that fatal Sunday afternoon a little more than two years ago. The bodies of seven of the crew, washed up from the wreck are buried in Shanklin cemetery; the place, moreover, is within sight of the spot where the ship went down ; and it was fitting, therefore, that here should be raised an appropriate and enduring memorial to the brave officers and crew of the hapless vessel. Bright weather favoured the unveiling ceremony, which took place in the presence of a large gathering of persons, amongst whom were naval and coastguard officers and a number of bluejackets, representing, we were told, all Her Majesty's ships now in Portsmouth Harbour. Soon after half, past three a procession was formed at the cemetery lodge, a number of coastguardmen walking at the head, and following them were the surpliced choir and clergy of St. Saviour's-on-the Cliff, Col. and the Lady Isabel Atherley and friends, and the members of the Shanklin Burial Board. The procession first went to the Gate Chapel, one of the clergy saying the sentences from the Burial Office, and in the Chapel, the anthem "man that is born of a woman" was sung. The procession then moved towards the graves, the choir chanting the 29th and part of the 17th Psalms, at the close of which—the company present having formed into a circle round the graves—the beautiful and appropriate hymn, "Fierce raged the tempest o'er the deep, from " Hymns Ancient and Modern," was sung with marked feeling. Following this was an address very impressive and appropriate by the Rev. C. I. Borland, vicar of St. Saviour's, who said he believed that there was in seamen a strong instinctive feeling that whereever their bodies might be cast they had a yearning desire that those bodies should be committed to the dust, if possible with pious words, and with loving friends standing round. It was for this reason, he had been told, that it was very often the custom with them to mark their bodies, so that they might be identified when they were found. It was to them a melancholy satisfaction that they could rear this stone over the bodies of the brave. We did not know their names, but we knew that they belonged to a service which we highly honoured. It might seem strange to some that ministers of religion should speak with admiration of those whose duty it was to carry arms in the service of their country ; but he had no hesitation in feeling and expressing that admiration. No Christian man could read his Bible without feeling that war may sometimes be a very necessary evil, and it was often the case that war called forth some of the bravest and noblest qualities that were to be found in man. For himself he had no fear that Englishmen would ever be found wanting in the truest type of bravery, or that they would ever do discredit to the flag that had waved so long. He had the comforting conviction that our sailors and our soldiers were becoming brave with a higher bravery than the mere courage that would face the enemy. He believed more and more that there were in the army and the navy men who were imbued with simple piety, and who were not afraid to acknowledge Him, their Saviour, who, though the gentlest and the most loving, was ever the bravest of the brave, the noblest of the noble. Many were there who made it their pride to serve Him and to do His will. It had been told him that some had supposed that amongst the bodies buried here was that of the captain of the ill-fated Eurydice. If so, then here had they an illustration of what a sailor might be—brave and noble in the highest sense of those words, for he was brave and noble in the service of his Saviour. And they also knew that there were some precious relics left of that crew. There were not many, but they knew that in a little Sussex cottage there was a letter read with tearful eyes, and that letter indicated that amongst the young on board the vessel there was just that tone which all must have wished should be the case when they heard of that terrible catastrophe. "We have come here this afternoon," concluded the rev. speaker, " to unveil this memorial, and to show that we honour the profession to which these men belonged, and that we have a lively sympathy with our sailors in the perils and dangers which they are called upon to endure. We have come also to show that we feel a deep interest in all that concerns them, and that our inmost hearts are touched when our brave ones are suddenly called away. They are dear to us, though no stone may tell their names, their worth, their glory ; but a record of their lives in hearts that love them well. These men, as much as those who fall in battle, fell in the path of duty and is the service of their country, and they belong to that noble band of heroes whose names and deeds grace our British story."

A prayer of dedication of the monument was then read by the Rev. F- Hummell, curate of St. Saviour's, as follows :

O Lord. at whose word the stormy wind ariseth, behold with Thy favour our memorial of these sailors, who sank with their ship almost in sight of home ; and mercifully grant that all who in pity shall read its record, may be led to ponder the uncertainty of this mortal life, and be stirred up to secure that life everlasting, which Thou has given us in our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.

Other appropriate prayers followed, and the Lady Isabel Atherley then unveiled the memorial by removing the Union Jack which had hitherto shrouded it from view.

The monument is of Portland stone, eight feet high, and the rockwork base is six feet by four feet. The base is surmounted by a naval trophy, consisting of crossed anchors and a cannon, with a snapped cable, a broken chain-link, and other fitting emblems, a Union Jack supplying the drapery. The cannon points to the spot where the Eurydice went down. On the front face of the monument is the inscription :

" To the memory of the officers and men of  
H.M.S. EURYDICE,  
which foundered off Shanklin,  
March 24, 1878,  
Seven of whom are buried here."

—and on the opposite side there is carved lettering as follows: 

" Erected by public subscription and unveiled by  
Lady Isabel Atherley,  
June 23rd, 1880."

—Immediately above this is a representation of the ribbon of a seaman's cap, with " H.M.S. Eurydice " upon it. The monument was designed by Mr. F. J. Moynihan, of London, assisted by Mr. A. Tyler, hon. sec. of the London committee, and the former gentleman executed the sculpture, which is strikingly effective and appropriate.

Col. Atherley, sfter the ceremony of unveiling was performed, addressed a few remarks to the company. He might say for Lady Isabel that she had experienced a feeling of satisfaction in being priviledged to take part in the tribute which had been paid that day to those brave men to whose memory that beautiful monument had been reared, and this satisfaction both as regarded his lady and himself was strengthened by the thought that there was about that place something which told of the kind and friendly feeling which existed between them and the inhabitants of Shanklin and its neighbourhood. He was sure he might say for Lady Isabel that she was always glad to be permitted to join those amongst whom she lived in doing any good and kindly work. The Colonel then referred in touching words to the calamity which occurred two years since in front of the windows of those who lived at Shanklin, and he added that the sorrow and the sympathy which were then called forth still lived—sorrow for those so suddenly and prematurely cut off, and sympathy for the bereaved relatives who had to mourn the loss of near and dear ones. Amongst the harrowing scenes which took place at the time was the casting up of the seven bodies which had found a resting-place in that Cemetery. Save in one instance, those bodies were unknown—unrecognised. After the interment a committee was formed for the purpose of erecting a suitable memorial ; but as the names of the bodies recovered were, with one exception, unknown, it was thought that the monument should be erected not to any particular persons, but to the memory of all the officers and crew, and to commemorate what was indeed a national calamity. To carry out this work a committee was formed in Shanklin, consisting of Messrs. Amon, F. Rayner, H. Sanders, R. T. Blew. Paybody, Tizard, Cantlow, and Humby, with himself as chairman, and under the able secretaryship of Mr. A. Tyler, a committee was formed in London, the members of which were Messrs. Robert Hewett (chairman), H. B. Clarke, W. Foster and J. Aldridge (of Leigh, Essex) C. J. James, and F. Meek. Mr. Tyler was instrumental in obtaining from the talented sculptor, Mr. Monyihan, a model of the memorial which had been just uncovered, and he thought they would all agree with him that in design and execution the work had been admirably carried out, and that the monument was in keeping with the event which it was intended to commemorate- After remarking that the Burial Board had in this instance waived their claim to the usual fees, the gallant colonel concluded by stating that, in the name of Lady Isabel, he declared the memorial unveiled. Might that monument stand there for many years, keeping fresh the memory of the brave crew of the Eurydice, and telling all who had to face the perils of the great waters that there were warm hearts on shore who deeply sympathised with them in the dangers which they were at times called upon to encounter. He was glad to see so many sailors present on that occasion. Amongst them were two naval officers, Lieut. Langley, of H.M.S. Excellent, and Lieut. Whiddon, of H.M.S. Crocodile, and he would ask one of then to say a few words.

Lieutenant Langley, R.N., stepped forward and said: Colonel and Lady Isabel Atherlev, on the part of the service to which I have the honour to belong I desire to thank you and all the subscribers for the beautiful monument which has been erected above the bodies of our poor comrades who died in the service of their country. Your kind act of this day will never be forgotten by the British Navy.

On the proposition of Mr. Nicholson, J.P., D.L. of Ventnor, an expression of thanks was conveyed' to the Lady Isabel Atherley for the part which she had so kindly and gracefully performed ; and Col. Atherley, after acknowledging the compliment, said they were greatly indebted to the clergy and choir of St. Saviour's for the impressive service which they had rendered, and which had invested the ceremony with an interest and solemnity that would not soon be forgotten.— After a few words in reply by the Rev. C. I. Burland, who spoke in high terms of his choir, the hymn " Eternal Father, strong to save," was sung, and the proceedings closed with the Benediction, pronounced by the Vicar of St. Saviour's.

This monument, which has been erected by public subscriptions, to the memory of the officers and men of H.M.S. Eurydice stands in the cemetery at Shanklin, where lie the seven bodies which were recovered from the wreck, including, as is believed, that of Captain Hare, the commander of the ill-fated vessel. It was unveiled on the 23rd ult., in the presence of a large number of spectators, by Lady Isabel Atherley a special religious service being performed and a brief address given by the Rev. C. I. Burland, Vicar of Shanklin. Addresses were also delivered by Colonel Atherley and by Lieutenant Langley, wno, on benalf of the naval service, thanked the people of Shanklin for erecting so worthy a memorial to the gallant men who perished amid such lamentable circum stances. The monument, which was designed by Mr. A. Tyler, Hon. Secretary of the Subscription Committee, and Mr. F. J. Moynihan, the sculptor, of Uxbridge Road, London, is constructed of the finest Portland stone. The small anchor which forms a part of the trophy is a relic from the ship, and was presented by Admiral Foley and the broken chain was given by Captain Goldsmith.

"EURYDICE " MEMORIAL.

A very handsome C- memorial to the memory of those who foundered in re H.M.S. Eurydice has just been completed in Hasiar m Cemetery, over the spot where the bodies were buried, at and facing a similar monument erected to the memory of the officers and menwho were killed by the explosion d on board the Thunderer.

The action of the water has rubbed it smooth 2- in some parts, and in other places there is carving in imitation of sea weed. The top is surmounted by the Jeanchor of the Eurydice, in a position nautically known as " fouled." The granite is of a dull grey kind, and d has been prepared by convict labour at Chatham, and le the Portland stone has been similarly dressed by the ly same means. On one side are the names of the officers s0 in the centre of two rows of men's names. On one corner are the words " H.M.S. Eurydice," and on *hanother side "Foundered March 24th, 188." JTust above the moulding of the obelisk are the texts: ": My a God is the rock of my refuge," " I will bring my people le again from the depths of thesea," "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul," and "A And the sea gave up the e dead which were in it." Altogether the monument is loft. ein height. On one side are 75 names another 103; a er third 71; and the fourth 62. The design is that of ar General Pasley.

THE EURYDICE MEMORIAL AT HASLAR

It will be remembered that the bodies of the unfortunate officers and seamen which were recovered from the wreck of the *Eurydice* were laid to rest in Haslar Cemetery, near Gosport, each grave being marked with a simple headstone. A more imposing memorial, as represented in our engraving, has now been erected on the spot. It was designed by Colonel Parley, R.E., C.B., and erected by Mr. Carruthers, the Assistant Civil Engineer for Gosport, and Messrs. Bramble, the contractors for the work. The base, of bright granite, bears upon its sloping ledge the 316 names of those who went down with the ill-fated vessel on Sunday, March 24th, 1878, and above this is a moulding of Portland stone, each side of which contains an appropriate quotation from Scripture. This again is surmounted by a huge rocky superstructure, on the summit of which is the real anchor, shackle, and part of the ship's cable which was recovered from the scene of the disaster. The measurement at the base is 23 feet by 17 feet, and the height is 10 feet. Our engraving is from a photograph by G. West and Son, Gosport, copies of which have been purchased by Her Majesty the Queen.
