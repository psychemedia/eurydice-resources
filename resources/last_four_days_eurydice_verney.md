PREFACE. 

The few known details of the appalling catastrophe which has overtaken a British Frigate leave many blanks in the mind of the general reader ; to those who know the daily life and routine of a Man-of-war the picture is more vivid.

The probable events of that sad Sunday, March 24, 1878, and of the three preceding days are here briefly sketched.

EDMUND H. VERNEY,

Captain, R.N.

March, 1878.


" How gloriously her gallant course she goes  
Her while wings flying never from her foes —  
She walks the waters like a thing of life,  
And seems to dare the elements to strife.  
Who would not brave the battle-fire, the wreck.  
To move, the monarch, of her peopleil deck." —  

*Byron's Corsair.*

THE STORY OF THE "EURYDICE."

THE " EURYDICE" was an old 26-gun frigate of 921 tons; what used derisively to be termed a " jackass-frigate :" she was the smallest class of frigate in the Navy, and not much larger than the largest class of brigs, but she had the advantage of carrying a heavier armament, with better accommodation for the officers and crew. She carried, therefore, two tiers of guns, one on the upper deck, and one on the main deck, while the lower deck was reserved for the quarters of the crew. A frigate's main deck is a water-tight deck, communicating with the lower deck only by hatchways in the middle of the ship. It is very usual to carry the main deck ports open at sea in moderate weather, because if she does ship one or two seas, no harm is done beyond wetting the deck ; the water cannot get below, as there are high coamings round the hatchways, and it only runs off harmlessly through the lee scuppers. Indeed, frigates are built on purpose to fight their main deck guns, and carry their main deck ports open at sea in all reasonably fine weather.

She was a peculiarly handy ship for navigating in narrow waters — more bouyant than a brig, and safer, from her higher freeboard ; her main deck ports were about five leet above the water line ; her draught of water at this time was 16 feet 6 inches, rather more than it had been formerly; her twenty-six old-fashioned
guns had been removed, and she carried four 64-pr. guns of a modern pattern.

Training Ship for Seamen.

When it was decided by the Admiraltv to exercise in Training-ships the ordinary seamen attached to the Reserves in the home ports, the *Eurydice* was fitted out for that purpose, and commissioned by Captain Hare, February 7th, 1877.

The officers for this ship were specially selected. Captain Marcus Augustus Stanley Hare was born in 1836, and entered the navy in 1849. Previous to his promotion to Lieutenant in 1857, he served in the *Valorous*, Captain Claude H. M. Buckle. C.B., in the Mediterranean. As Lieutenant he served in the *Calcutta*, 84, on the China station, until transferred in 1859 to the *Chesapeake*, 51, on the same station, in which ship he remained for two years. He then served in the *Chanticler*, 17, attached to the Channel Squadron until the end of 1862, when he was removed to the Trafalgar, 70, in the Mediterranean ; after remaining in her for two years he was appointed to the *St. George*, 72, Coastguard ship at Portland, whence he was promoted to the rank of Commander, January 1st, 1867. He was Commander of the *Royal Oak*, 24, Iron-clad, in the Mediterranean, until January, 1872 ; afterwards he commanded the *Boseawen*, 20, training-ship for boys at Portland, where he shewed special tact and ability in dealing with young sailors, and bringing them into shape ; and on February 13th, 1873, he was promoted to the rank of Captain. From this short statement it will be seen that he had been constantly at sea or on active service, he was known among his brother officers as a painstaking and careful seaman, well skilled in handling ships, and had received four medals for his war services.

From many applicants he was chosen, out of his turn, for this command ; but even the disappointed ones admitted that a wise selection had been made, and that among the junior captains no fitter man could have been found for so desirable and responsible a command. His birth imposed on him a noble life, for his father before him had been a (gallant seaman, and his mother was one of the race of Stanley's that has given to the country so many heroes and statesmen.

Officers of the "Eurydice."

The First Lieutenant was an officer chosen with equal care. Lieutenant Francis Hope Tabor, served as Sub-lieutenant in *Minotaur*, 34, iron-clad, Captain James G. Goodenough, flag-ship in the Channel Squadron, until promoted to be Lieutenant on May 19th, 1870. As Lieutenant he served in the *Narcissus*, 28, wooden screw frigate. Captain William Codrington, flag-ship successively of Rear-Admirals F, Beauchamp P. Seymour, C.B., and Frederick A. Campbell, with the Flying Squadron, in 1870-71 and '72. At the end of the latter year, he was appointed First Lieutenant of the *Cruiser*, 5, Commander Alfred T. Dale, in the Mediterranean, where he remained for four years. The *Cruiser* was a sailing corvette attached to the Mediterranean Fleet, as a training ship for young officers and seamen, and  more than one captain in that fleet had noted Mr. Tabor as a young lieutenant of no ordinary promise. The special knowledge and experience he had gained in the *Cruiser*, while serving under one of our smartest Captains, and the high prolcssional reputation he had made for himself, at once marked him out as the best man that could be found for the more responsible post of First Lieutenant of the Eurydice.

A Smart Crew.

The other Lieutenants were all selected for their promise as good officers. Her crew consisted of a small permanent complement of experienced subordinate and petty otficers to act as instructors, and the number was completed by as many ordinary seamen under training as there was room for. Altogether she carried upwards of three hundred souls, instead of the two hundred and twenty-five which had been her complement in former commissions. She carried the same ballast as formerly, and a rather larger quantity of fresh water for the use of the crew ; before she was put in commission her stability was tested, and found to be greatly improved since her last service.

Cruising in the Chaunel.

During the summer of 1877 the Eurydice was constantly seen cruising in the British Channel, running through the Needles, or passing through Spithead, always the picture of a man-of-war, and handled in a seaman-like manner.

In November she was sent on a cruise all round the West Indies, and on March 6th left Bermuda to return home with her now well-trained crew, all in their early prime, the choicest flower of the British Navy. Eurydice was to them a name of hope and promise : who could have imagined that, (like her classic namesake) she was to be lost when at the point of being restored to home and country ?

THURSDAY.

"Oh ! what can sanitify the joys of home  
Like Hope's gay glance from ocean's troubled form?"—  
*Byron's Corsair.*

THURSDAY on board a man-of-war is sometimes called rope-yarn Sunday ; it is a day when the work for the men is made as light as possible. In the afternoon the Boatswain pipes "Hands make and mend clothes !" the men get out their clothes and overhaul them.

Seamen Tailors. 

Part of the instruction of boys and young seamen is tailoring, and almost every man can make his own clothes. Of course there are some who have a heaven-born genius for cutting out, and these may be seen measuring their shipmates with a knife-lanyard, according to the mysterious traditions handed down from Benbow's time, which give the distinctive cut that marks the sailors trousers, — a garment that cannot be produced on dry land. The edge of the cloth is laid parallel to a seam in the deck ; the measurements taken with the knife-lanyard are at once transferred to it, and marked thereon with a piece of pipe-clay, borrowed from the marines mess ; then the bulging parts of the humman form divine, are marked out as a segment of a circle described from a centre, and at a radius known only to the initiated ; for this is the most important part of all ; a sailor cannot wear braces, and the fit round the hips is that which everything hangs on, so on this is staked the reputation of the cutter out. When the scissors come into play, they must deftly follow the lines chalked out for them, that the scraps may come in to make a cloth cap.

A great deal of work can be put into a pair of No. 1 cloth trousers, or a new serge frock ; cunning embroidery round the pocket-holes, and such work as is called "clocks" when applied to a lady's slocking. Litlle stars are sometimes worked rouiul the eylet-holes for tying-in the trousers behind. The herring-bone sewing on a serge frock may have much mind thrown into it, but no such fancy work may be allowed to deviate from the strict uniform.

Artists at Work.

On a Thursday afternoon you may see an artist at work on the human skin ; a young fellow with his sleeve turned up sits in front of the operator, who is armed with a bunch of needles tied to a short stick, and has his two tins of colours, Indian ink and vermillion. When Indian ink is not attainable, a mixture of gunpowder and soot with oil is considered very choice. And thus a man is tattooed with an indelible mark, — perhaps his initials, or those of the girl he loved last, or it may be a ship in full sail, or a Burmese demon, and what-ever he thinks suited to his own peculiar style of beauty. 

Overhauling Ditty Boxes.

Besides his bag of clothes, every seaman has his "ditty-box," — a box something like a small writing-desk. He carries the key on his knife-lanyard, and the box itself is kept fastened up between the beams over his mess. As the Englishman's house is his castle, so the seaman's ditty-box may be said to be *his* castle ; it is the only place he has under lock and key ; there he keeps his needles and thread, his buttons, his money and his letters, and the photograph of his mother and sister, or maybe of a dearer friend still ; all his littlt; home relics, and any small gifts he is bringing home from foreign ports. A sailor loves to overhaul his ditty-box.

On Thursdax the 21st, we may be sure that many a ditty box was overhauled on board the Eurydice. In a sunny corner, under the shelter of the weather gun whale, the young seaman studied again the well-thumbed photograph of the loving face that he thought would soon so proudly and so tenderly welcome him home, or again read for the last time such sweet gentle words as he hoped soon to hear in the well-remembered tones. And when four o'clock came, and the decks had to be cleared up, the forecastle sweeper cgave him a friendly prod with his broom, as he hurried all his little goods into their box, and broke the string of the bead necklace from Barbadoes. As the lock clicked he thought how joyously he would re-open it next week, and shew to the dear circle at home the little treasures he had gathered in the Indies.

Preparing Reports.

That Thursday was a busy day with the officers too ; the paymaster and his clerks were preparing the demands for fresh stores and provisions, and making out the papers for all the smart young fellows to be drifted off to iron-clads ; for, had they not heard of the warlike preparations at home, and was not the Admiralty, and indeed the whole country counting on the return of the choice three hundred ? The doctors were preparing their medical reports to show how the health of the crew h;had prospered in their cruise; the navigating lieutenant was looking out the charts of the Chops of the Channel, and again refreshing his memory from the sailing directions, that he might at once readily recognize any land or lighthouse.

Preparing for Admiral's Inspection.

Thurstla)- afternoon is the first lieutenant's 
holiday, but he would very likely use it to go 
over the watch-hill again, and see that every 
station was filletl up, and every i)reparation 
made for the Admiral's insjiection, which would 
be sure to take place on the Monday or the 
Tuesda}-. And a strict ins{)ection it would be, 
and ought to be ; the Eurydicc was com- 
missioned to show these young seamen the 
highest pitch of perfection and discii)line to 
which a British frigate could be wrought, antl 
nothing less would satisfy that captain or his 
officers. 

Thursday is the guest-night in a ward 
room mess ; one or two of the junior ofticers 
were dining there ; the stewarel was a trifle

reckless with his good things, for there was a 
fair wind, and the voyage was nearly ovcrr, 
and there was plenty more to be had at 
Portsmouth. The ward-room servants were 
getting ready the lists of clothes to be sent 
to the wash as soon as the anchor should 
be let go. The captain added another 

paragraph to his report of proceedings, and 
thanked God that no accident or mishap had 
marred the success of this lengthened cruise so 
nearly ended. 



FRIDAY. 



Kcef topsails, reef ! the nuistcr calls again. 
'I'hr halyiirds and lop-bow-iiiics soon are gone. 
To clue-lines and reef-tackles next they run : 
The shivering sails descend : the yards are square. 
Then quick aloft the ready crew repair : 
The weather earings and the lee they passed, 
The reefs enrotl'd, and every point made fast."

FRIDAY 



FRIDAY is the day specially devoted to 
great gun exercises. As soon as morning 
prayers are over the bugle sounds to 
" Quarters for Exercise," and every preparation 
is made for battle. The ma^razines and shell- 
room are opened, dummy cartridges are passed 
up, and all the motions are gone through as if 
in time of action. The guns are loaded and 
run out, and trained in such directions as may 
be ordered. The men are armed with their 
rifles, cutlasses, boarding-pikes and pistols, 
and exercised in the defence of their own ship, 
as well as in preparations for boarding an 
enemy. On this Friday it was not so much 
great quickness that was aimed at as accuracy 
of detail. No doubt but the mm would work 
quickly enough and toss their heavy 64-pr. guns

about like pl.i) lhinL;^^ under the cyr ot the 
Inspcctini^ Officer; hut each one must know 
and understand the detail of his duties, that no 
question could lake him aback, and no chanj^e 
to another number at the L;un find him un- 
prepared. And the exercise of manning- and 
armini^ the boats was gone through with every 
preparation for sending them away at the 
shortest notice, by day or by night. The men 
were exercised at Fire-quarters, that they 
might be ready to co[)e with what is the 
deadliest foe on board a ship. 

In the afternoon they were exercised at sail 
drill, a drill so important that it forms part 
of the routine of every day when weather 
permits. 

This drill consists in setting and in taking 
in as rapidly as possible every sail that the ship 
can carry ; a vessel may be seen with every 
possible sail set alow and aloft, and in three or 
four minutes all will be taken in except the 
close-reefed topsails that would be carried in 
a '^de of wind : or a sail is supjiosed to be

split, and it is at once furled, sent down, and 
replaced by a new one from the sail-room ; or 
a spar is supposed to be sprung, when all sail 
on it must immediately be taken in, the 
yards on that mast must be sent down, the 
damaged mast must be replact:d by a sound 
one, the yards are again sent up, and the sails 
set as before. 

Or sometimes the life-buoy is let go as if a 
man had fallen overboard ; then the sail must 
be reduced, the ship rounded to, and a boat 
lowered to pick up the life-buoy. These 
exercises were of the highest importance on 
board the Eurydicc ; she was specially com- 
missioned to teach to these young seamen those 
drills and evolutions, which even in a masted 
ironclad can be but imperfectly carried out. 

For a ship to excel in exercises aloft the 
highest degree of organization is required ; thr 
intricate tracery of ropes whose various pur- 
poses are to the landsmen so hopelessly con 
fusing, is to the sailor a beautiful and perfectly 
adapted machine for controlling the spars and

sails whicli L;ivc life and motion lo his ship, as 
his own sinews and muscles give motion to his 
body. As our muscles are directed by reason 
and instinct, so must these ropes be manned by 
men familiar with the objects they serve. If a 
sail is to be taken in men are stationed to let 
go some ropes and to haul on others; the oldest 
and most experienced men are stationed hy the 
ropes to be let go ; those arc the most 
important. If the man is tlurried, and loses his 
head, and lets go his rope too soon or too late, 
the sail may be sjjlit, the yard may be sprung, 
and the safety of men, aye, and of the ship 
herself may be endangered. For efficient sail- 
drill it is necessary that every rope be 
properly manned, and that the right man be 
in the right place. 

If the Ew'ydicc had one strong point, it 
there was one respect in which she was pre- 
eminently eftlcient, it was her sail-drill. If 
there was one captain in the nav)' more than 
iinother who would Ix- justilietl in carr\ing a 
press of sail it was the Captain ol the Jiuryditc.

CliarUs Kiiigilfy. 



SATURDAY. 



ON the Saturday morning the first 
business, \vhen the watch came on deck 
at four o'clock, would be to bend cables. 
When a ship is on a voyage, and far away in 
clear blue water, the chain cables are unbent, and 
stowed away in the chain-lockers ; they are thus 
out of the way ; the rust does not stain the deck, 
and the bows of the ship are in some 
degree lighter and more buoyant ; the anchors 
too are closely stowed and lashed. So when 
the ship is leaving land, and the rattle of the 
cable is heard as it runs down into the locker, the 
sound tells tliat the sliip is speeding out into the 
open sea ; and when the well-known sound is 
heard of the cable being hauled up again on

deck, wc know \vc arc ncarin^ land and tliat the 
anchors are being cleared away. And it that 
noise awoke any one at four o'clock that 
mornino; he turned over and went to sleep again 
with pleasant ch-eams, for it was a sound that 
told him of honie not very tar olt. 

Saturday is tlie great cleaning day on board 
a ship ; sounds of holy-stones and scrubbing- 
l)rushes begin at four in the morning, Otficers 
and men walk about without shoes and 
stockings, and with their trousers turned up 
above their knees in the cold grey morning, 
wliile every now and tlien a wasii-deck l^ucket 
tull of water dashes past with the recklessness 
of a hansom cab in the Stran^l : ami the work 
is not hurried, for there is no daily inspection 
on a Saturday morning, aiul all the- forenoon 
is devoted to thoroughly cleaning every part ot 
the ship. 

At about eight o'clock, when the mvn have 
breakfasted, the same careful cleansing work 
betrins below ; the lower deck and siore-

rooms arc well lighted up, and the smell of soap 
is in the air ; the ladders are tiiriH^d wrong-side 
up, that the traffic may not dim the whiteness 
of the fresh-scrul)l)ed steps. At the top and 
bottom of every hatchwa)- are swabs and mats 
that you ma)^ wipe your feet, and as the day 
wears on there reigns everywhere the dreary 
comfortless aspect of perfect cleanliness which 
is supposed to be its own reward. 

All the m(;ss-traps must be polished to day ; 
th:2 tin mess-kettles must shine like silver; 
the hoops of the bread barges like burnished 
gold. The mess tables are scrubbed as white 
as a dainty table cloth, and every stain of 
grease is removed. Where needful the white- 
wash overhead is touched up, and each mess 
vies with its neighbour — if maybe some word 
of approval shall drop from the Captain's lips 
on the morrow's inspection. Windsails are 
passed down to dry the decks, and deck-cloths 
are spread where there is most traffic. 

In the afternoon the brass work receives

Hut what a special Saturday was this when 
the Eurydicc was so near home ! How many keen 
professional c;)es would be on her when she 
reached Portsmouth. ( )f course the Inspecting 
Offic(.'r v.ouKl \isit. and inspect every part of 
the ship, the holds, the storerooms, even the 
bilges ; but there would also be brother officers 
come on board to see old friends and messmates, 
and to criticise the smart liurxdiic, and there 
would be identic and uncrilicising eyes prepared 
to think all beautiful and jx-rfect in the shij) 
that held some beloved son or brother ; and so 
there never was a Saturday when the unavoid- 
able discomforts were more readil)- put \\\> with, 
t)r when all hands were so eager to brighten 
and smarten up the craft they had learned to 
trust cUid love so well. 

There' was a carefulh -tended canary on board

that one young' fellow was taking home to his 
mother, and the cage must be kept dry, and no 
splash of salt water l)e allowed to fall on the 
cherished ])ird. 

The [)ainters were busy all the after- 
noon, touching u[) any stains on the white 
ribbon outside, or any marks made by the ropes 
chafing the black gunwale, for the Eiirydicc 
must to-morrow look her very best ; the twelve 
life-belts in the cutter wanted touching up w^ith 
a little white paint, and so they were hung up 
in the fme drying wind. 

When the men mustered at evening quarters, 

to each was served out a clean hammock, for 

nothincr sets off a smart fricjate so well as the 

row of snow-white hammocks ranged along 

each side in the hammock-netting. At eight 

o'clock the first night-watch was set, and soon 

after was heard the clear voice of the look-out 

man, " A light on the port bow, sir," and the 

voice of the officer of the forecastle repeating, 

" a light reported on the port bow, sir ;" and

Perhaps the decfj-sea lead-line was got 
ready, the sail reduced, and a cast taken of the 
lead to fix accurately the position of th.e ship. 
One light is ver)- much like another at night, 
yet the paymaster, and the doctor and others 
whose duties do not call them on deck, sleep all 
the better if they go up and have a look before 
they retire to their cabins. And many a sea- 
man of the Watch-below, too, must have a look 
at the Start Light before he turns in to his 
hammock. " Thank ( jocI " is in many a heart, 
if not on every lip, — as one of the lads before 
leaving home, had said, " Mother, rough as we 
are, we never turn in without giving ourselves 
into the hands of God !" 



SUNDAY. 



'■ The powerful sails, with steady breezes swelled, 
Swift and more swift the yielding bark impelled ; 
Across her stem the parting waters run 
As clouds, by lentjpcsls wafted, pass the sun. 
Impatient thus she darts along the shore." 

Falconer's Skif^vrtck. 



SUNDAY 



WHEN that Sunday morninL,^ dawned, the 
ship was passing Portland with a fine 
bracing north-westerly breeze, smooth 
water, and joyful life in every white-crested 
wave ; with a fair wind, there was every 
prospect of anchoring that night at Spithead. 
Every naval officer has a sentimental feeling 
for Spithead ; so many of our naval heroes 
have sailed from Spithead to serve their 
country, and some have returned to Spithead 
covered with the glory of mighty achiev- 
ments. It is the historic parade-ground of our 
fleets ; it is at Spithead that our Sovereign 
holds her naval reviews, and no sailor re- 
turning from abroad can approach Spithead 
quite unmoved. 



40 Assembling for Prayers. 



Ami so tliat morninj;", after tlu* usual routine- 
work was over, at ten o'clock, all hands 
were inusieretl at divisions, for the important 
ceremony of the Captain's Sunday Inspection. 
There was not I'Som for them all to stand in a 
single line : rountl the decks there was a 
double line, and the Captain, accompanied by 
the first Lieute-nant and all heads of depart- 
ments, passed round the decks between the 
two lines of seamen, drawn up bare-headed. 

The liurydicc always carried a full crew, 
but now she was bringiuL;' to Rnj^land a Cap- 
tain of RoNal Engineers, returnintj; home on 
leave, with six sappers whose period of service 
had e.xpired, and a Sergeant of Marines, with 
twelv<! men also taking a passage home, and 
other supernumeraries, and at the morning 
inspection her upj)i!r dt:ck was crowdici. The

ive. 

After service the men went to their dinners. 
As the day wore on, the wind fell somewhat 
lighter, and the ship was put under all sail 
on the port tack. As they neared the Isle 
of Wight, the beauty of that scene, in the bright 
March sun was very striking. They were 
keeping as close in to the shore as they could 
without losing the wind ; passing within two or 
three miles of Ventnor, they could plainly see 
all that was going on, and they knew how beau- 
tiful their ship must look, with her spread of 
snowy canvass gleaming in the sunlight, to the 
folk who were taking their Sunday afternoon 
walk. 

All the men were in their Sunda)' clothes ; 
few were asleep ; they were reading, or writing 



42 Open Ports. 

letters to hr. postt-tl in ;i (vw hours, and to carry 
to remote Englisli hamlets the news of tlie 
sailor's safe return ; some were looking 
throu-h the open ports, from wliich no danger 
could be anticipated in so smooth a sea. and 
which admitted light, and fresh wholesome air 
to the somewhat crowded decks below. 

A frigate's ports open outwards, so when 
they have to be closed in heavy weather, the 
Aveight of water outside helps to close them as 
soon as the port lanyards are let go. 

At a quarter before two o'clock the lower 
studding sail was set, the wind off the land 
having: hauled somewhat furtlier att. Both the 
Captain and the First Lieutenant were on deck, 
cheerily discussing the events of the cruise, and 
the greetings of the morrow. 

The danger of sailing close under iiigh 
land in s(iually weather is well known to 
seamen ; gusts of wind coming over a cliff 
form themselves into eddies anti uhirlwinds, 
and in such circumstances additional cart: is

requisite. Well-known, too, is it that when 
standing- out from the shelter of high land past 
such a point as Dunnosc Head, the change 
from the comparative calm, will show itself at 
hrst in strong and eddying squalls. A ship 
further out from land will not feel the squalls 
with equal violence, nor will their direction 
change so suddenly. The sea would not so 
suddenly change, and, indeed it would be only 
in exceptionally stormy weather that the 
waves would assume any magnitude off San- 
down Bay with a northerly wind. Were the 
ship, therefore, not under an undue press of 
sail, no danger need be apprehended from 
the open ports. 

To the danger of such squalls the Captain 
was alive, for both he and his First Lieutenant 
were keenly watching the sky to windward 
with the eyes of practised seamen ; the watch 
were all ready on deck, prepared to take in the 
canvass when the proper moment should arrive.

Against my %ery heart ! Poor souls ! They perished. 
Had I been any god of power. I would 
Have sunk the sea within the earth, before 
It should the good ship so have swallowed, and 
The freighting souls within her." 



THE SQUALL. 



THE Captain was anxious to reach liis 
anchorage before dark, for the already 
low barometer was still falling, probably 
a Southerly gale was brewing, and the fine 
Northerly wind might chop round to South- 
east ; moreover the ebb-tide was making strong 
round St. Catherine's point, and although the 
ship was bowling along through the water at 
the rate of nine or ten knots, she was not going 
more than five or six past the land. 

It was half-past three ; the wind was fresh- 
ening ; as the ship passed out from under the 
lee of the Island the wind would freshen more ; 
there were hard-edged clouds of dazzling 
whiteness passing swiftly overhead, but the 
high land off Dunnose was dead to windward, 



48 The Squall increases. 

so they coukl not l)c sticn far off. Tlu; wind off 
the shore was sharp and cuttinL;;^ ; the Captain 
ortlercd the watch to \n: called to shorten sail ; 
the roi>es were manned, hut not a ropeyarn 
must be started till the order is <^dven. He 
sees the merchant vessels in the oftlng shorten- 
ing sail betimes to the freshening gale, as 
shorthandcd vessels must ; but the luirydicc 
with her numerous and picked crew can well 
afford to wail till the last moment : his men 
have never failed him yet. and they will not 
fail him now : it is no rash or foolhardy spirit 
that makes him wait to give the order, but the 
experience and self-reliance of some thirty 
years of seafaring life. 

The first puff ot the coming s(piall is seen, 
and the order is given to take in the royals ; 
tlur royal-yard-men are in the rigging on their 
way up to furl their sails when the Captain 
calls th(.:m down ; the squall is already in- 
creasing with dangerous rapidity ; and at once 
the order is given to shorten sail ; alread\- ilie 
studdintl-sails are cominij- in when a icrrinc 



Shorten Sail! 49 

blast strikes the ship on the port bow and 
vvitlioLit a moment's warning throws lier on her 
beam-ends. A blinding' snow-storm envelopes 
the ship ; the furious gale howls through the 
rigging, snaps off the mizen topmast, rends to 
ribbons the now^ loosened sails, and lashes the 
ropes in a hundrc^d directions ; the poor hull 
staesfers and strains ; the water rushes in 
through the lee main-deck ports, along the lee 
gangway, and over the lee hammock-netting ; 
the men are washed away from their stations 
and carried overboard ; the fore and main 
sheets are let go to ease her and the Captain's 
order is " if you can't let it go, cut it ; " the 
topsail-haulyards and the topsail-sheets are let 
"■o. A orallant vouno- sub-lieutenant rushes to 
the wheel and helps the steersman to put the 
hehn hard up, and then he is seen no more. 
The Captain climbs on to the weather side 
of his ship, whence he sees her keel level with 
the water. The lee boats have, of course, 
been washed away : in vain he directs an effort 
to lower a port boat, bravely supported by his

first-licnitcnanl. The two doctors haviiiL,^ 
reached tlic deck, an* now src-n struggling in 
the water. The sea is rushing down through 
tlic hatclnvays, and above the howling of the 
blast arc heard the roaring of the escaping air, 
antl the confused cries of the men on the 
lower deck ; and as the vessel fills she slowly 
rights herself, gives a slight plunge forward, 
and sinks to the bottom, barely five minutes 
from the time the squall struck her. 

We know but little more ; our last glimpse 
of the CajDtain is standing (jn his sinking ship ; 
for otliers there might be life-belts, or boats, or 
floating spars, but no thought of self could 
cross the Captain's mind at such a time. The 
dej)th of that monient's sadness his brother- 
officers alone can realize, but as he remem- 
bered his young wife and two baby daughters 
he would commit them to God's mercy and to 
England's sympathy, while for himself he 
would know that his C"()untr)''s verdict wouKl 
be that the Captain of the RuyyJicc died 
<;lriving to do his duty. 



The Wreck. 51 



In ten to liftccii minutes the dense snow- 
storm clears away as rapidly as it had arisen. 
Tile wind falls to a keen stiff breeze, and the 
sun again shines out brightly upon the sea. 
In eleven fathoms of water, off Sandown Bay, 
and little over two miles from shore are visible 
the mast-heads of the ill-fated ship ; the strong 
tide swiftly sweeps away to the southward all 
wreckage, and such drownincr men as are 
clinging thereto ; one by one they drop off, 
benumbed with the fierce cold, and disheart- 
ened at finding themselves swept out into mid- 
channel. Still as anon, one passes another, 
comes a cheerful shout to hold on, and to be 
of good courage, for who could doubt that in 
so great a thoroughfare and so near the shore 
help must be at hand? Alas! the thickly 
fallino- snow-cloud had hidden the siijht from 
every eye, and as yet none realized their peril. 

Captain William Langworthy Jenkin, of 
the schooner Hnniia. bound from Newcastle 
for Poole, first saw the wreckage and tlie royals 
of the ship above water. Being somewhat

further Iroiii tht." land, and under reduced 
canvass, he had not felt the extreme violence 
of the squall. 1 ie at once steered for the spot, 
and hoisting out his boats, succeeded in picking- 
up five men, of whom only two survived ; — 
Benjamin Cuddiford, able seaman, and Sydney 
Fletcher, ordinary seaman. The other bodies 
brousfht on shore were those of Lieutenant 
Tabor, the first lieutenant. Captain F'errier, of 
the Royal Engineers, and George A. Bennett, 
a first-class petty-officer. 

Benjamin Cuddiford was saved by a life- 
buoy which he found floating in the water, and 
which brought him again to the surface after 
he had been sucked down by the sinking of 
the shi;). lie did what he could to save others 
by taking them pieces of floating wreck. 
Sydney Fletcher was also saved by a cork life- 
belt. From the mouths of these two comes all 
we kn(j\v, or ever shall know, of the loss of a 
splendid frigate, and her living freight of some 
three hundretl and fifty souls.

"SORROW ON THE SEA." 



"There is sorrow on the sc.-i— it cannot he quiet." — Jer. xlix. 23. 



[The follmviiig poem, v>h!ch apptared in the " Christian" and other papers, was 
attributed to Captain M. Hare, but recently it has been ascertained , en good 
aiit/tority. that they -n>ere ivritten by a Lady friend ; and committed to mi-niory 
by Captain Hare, who aftenoards inserted tlieni in an album. | 



I STOOD on llie shore of the beautiful sea, 
As the billows were roamini; wild and free ; 
Onward they came with unfailing force, 
Then backward turned in their restless course ; 
Ever and ever sounded their roar, 
Foaming and dashing against the shore ; 
Ever and ever they rose and fell. 
With heaving and sighing and mighty swell ; 
And deep seemed calling aloud to deep, 
Lest the murmuring waves should drop to sleep. 
In summer and winter, by night and by day, 
Thro' cloud and sunshine holding their way ; 
Oh I when shall the ocean's troubled breast 
Calmly and quietly sink into rest ? 
Oh ! when shall the waves' wild murmuring cease, 
And the mighty waters be hushed to peace 7 



66 "Sorrow on the Sea." 



It cannot be iiuict — it cannot rest ; 

There must be heaving on ocean's breast ; 

The tide must ebb, and the title must flow, 

Whilst the changing seasons come and go. 

Still from the depths of that hidden store 

There are treasures tossed up along the shore ; 

Tossed by the billows— then sei/etl again — 

Carried away by the rushing main. 

Oh, strangely glorious and beautiful sea ! 

Sounding for ever mysteriously, 

Why arc thy billows still rolling on, 

With their wild and sad and musical tone? 

Why is there never repose for thee? 

Why slumberest thou not, oh mighty sea. 



Then the ocean's voice I seemed to hear, 
Mournfully, solemnly— sounding near. 
Like a wail sent up from the caves below. 
Fraught with dark memories ol human woe. 
Telling of loved ones buried there, 
Of the dying shriek and the dying prayer ; 
Telling of hearts still watching in vain 
For those who shall never come .again. 
Of the widow's groan, the orphan's cry, 
And the mother's speechless agony. 
Oh, no, the ocean can never rest 
With .such secrets hidden within its breast. 
Tlierc is sorrow written upon the sea. 
And dark and stormy its waves must be ; 
It cainict be (juiet, it cannot sleep. 
That dark, relentless, and stormy deep. 



"Son-ow on the Sea." ^1 



Hut a (lay will come, a hlessed day, 

Wlicn earthly sonuw sliall pass away, 

When the hour of anguish shall turn to peace, 

Ami even the roar of the waves shall cease. 

Then out from its deepest and darkest bed 

Old ocean shall render up her dead, 

And, freed from the weight of human woes, 

Shall (|uietly sink in her last repose. 

No sorrow shall ever be written then 

On the depths of the sea or the hearts of men, 

But heaven and earth renewed shall shine, 

Still clothed in glory and light divine. 

Then where shall the billows of ocean be ? 

OoHi! for in heaven shall be "no more sea ! " 

'Tis a bright and beautiful thing of earth, 

That cannot share in the soul's " new birth ; " 

'Tis a life of murmur and tossing and spray, 

And at resting-time it must pass away. 



But, oh ! thou glorious and beautiful sea, 
There is health and joy and blessing in thee ; 
Solemnly, sweetly, I hear thy voice, 
Bidding me weep and yet rejoice — 
Weep for the loved ones buried beneath. 
Rejoice in Him who has conquered death ; 
Weep for the sorrowing and tempest-tossed. 
Rejoice in Him who has saved the lost ; 
Weep for the sin, the sorrow, and strife. 
And rejoice in the hope of eternal life.
