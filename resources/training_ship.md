# H.M.S. Eurydice, Training Ship

In 1877, H.M.S. Eurydice was refitted as a training ship. For many years, the fleet had been miving over to aromoured steamships and rigged sailing ships were no longer appropriate for modern naval warfare. However, it was still felt that sailors should still be able to handle traditionally rigged vessels and that training ratings on them would be to their benefit as seamen.

The Eurydice was thus converted over to a training ship in the Spring of 1877, before embarking on a voyage to the West Indies in Autumn 1877. Rumour had it that a calamity had befallen the ship, but a telegram reported in the *Naval & Military Gazette and Weekly Chronicle of the United Service* of Wednesday 21 November 1877, received 17th of November and dated November 16th, 1877, revealed that all was well.

In passing, we might note that this news articles reveals how tegraphic cable communication was available between the West Indies and Britain by this time. A little bit of digging turns up the following history of the cable that presumably carried the telegram signal.

1845 William Hooper, a chemist, set up a factory around 1845 in Mitcham, Surrey, to produce rubber goods mostly for the medical profession. He experimented with rubber insulation for electric cables and eventually found a way of insulating cables in a continuous process.
c.1857 or later: The Indian Government placed Hooper's first order, followed by another order for cable to link India and Ceylon. W. T. Henley carried out the armouring of the cable.
1860 Company established by William Hooper trading under his own name.
1870 Hooper formed Hooper's Telegraph Works Ltd. to undertake both manufacture and laying of submarine cables. The first order for the new company was from the Great Northern Telegraph Co for a cable connecting Vladivostock to Hong Kong; Siemens Brothers and Co carried out the armouring of this cable.
1873 Hooper's laid the cable (which had been made for an Atlantic crossing) off the east coast of South America, having been offered this concession by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Co on the condition that Hooper's dropped their plans for a transatlantic cable.

SEAMANSHIP OF YOUNG SAILORS.

The Admiralty are about to take practical measures for improving the seamanship of our young sailors. At present a boy having served a certain time on board a training-ship is transferred to a flagship, where he becomes an ordinary seaman. He is then draughted to a sea-going ship, and may, under favourable conditions, become an expert and efficient seaman, knowing the name and use of every rope on board, and capable of turning his hands to anything that may be required in the severest weather. It may happen, however, that he is sent to a ram of Rupert type, or a mastless ship like the Devastation where he can learn little or nothing of his profession; and as vessels of these classes are increasing, and likely to increase, it is necessary that special measures should be taken to bestow a thorough sea training upon young seamen, so that they may find themselves at home, no matter what the character of the ship may be to which they are despatched. A step in the right direction has been taken by the fitting out of the Eurydice, a sixth-rate wooden fripate of the old class as a sea-going training-ship for ordinary seamen. The Eurydice is 140ft. in length between perpendiculars. 78ft. in extreme breadth, and 921 tons burthen, old measurement. When ready for commission she will furnish accommodation for 280 young seamen, in addition to her commander and staff of officers. She will carry six 64-pounder 71cwt. guns, mounted on rear truck carriages, three on each side of the main deck. She will be ship rigged, and will probably have an independent commander's commission. Before being draughted for service in sea-going ships young ordinary seamen will undergo a six months' practical training at sea on board the Eurydice, which is totally guiltless of machinery of any kind and it cannot be doubted that the professional schooling which they will thereby receive will go far to improve the efficiency of our seamen as sailors.

...

It has long been felt that an evil has arisen from a large number of ordinary seamen after being released from the restraint of the training ships being kept for a time in the depot ships at the home ports, previous to being drafted for foreign stations. To remedy this evil the Lords of the Admiralty have commissioned the Eurydice as a training ship at Portsmouth for ordinary seamen in the Channel. Thus while the men will be at home and available for foreign service they will be kept under proper training in a position where discipline can be properly maintained, and be saved from the temptations inseparable from nightly leave.

Eurydice, 4 training-ship for ordinary seamean, Captain Marcus A S. Hare

Much excitement prevailed Portsmouth during last week, consequent on a rumour that during the recent heavy gale this vessel lost her topmasts and topsail yard, and that several men were carried overboard with them and drowned. On inquiry we learn that nothing official is yet to hand. On the 17th of November all apprehensions were removed by the receipt of the following telegram:— "Eurydice, Lisbon, Friday, November 16th. 8 55 p.m.—Arrived all well; will leave on the 24th. Send letters and papers to Barbadoes."
