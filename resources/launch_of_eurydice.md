The Eurydice, 26, building Portsmouth upon the plan laid down Admiral Elliot, will launched next month. She constructed on the draught of the Vestal, with an increase of length and a decrease of beam, and the reduction of the angle of the floor, which will reduce her draught of water about 18 inches. This vessel is extremely clean abaft and forward, and there is no doubt she will have great velocity ; but, in all probability, she will prove very wet.

The Portsmouth, Portsea and Gosport Herald, PORTSMOUTH, MAY 20.

The Eurydice, 26 guns, built according to the plan of Rear Admiral the Hon. George Elliot, was launched on Tuesday. The ceremony of naming her was performed by a daughter of the gallant Admiral. A numerous assemblage of persons had collected, and a few minutes before high-water she left her semi-aerial position for a more natural and graceful one upon the surface of the element over which she is hereafter to move. The following are her principal dimensions  [Feet. Inches.]: —

Length between tbe perpendiculars . . 141 2
Keel for tonnage . . ..116 1 1/2
Breadth extreme .. .. 38 10
Breadth for tonnage . . . . 38 4
Depth in hold .. .. 8 9 

908 tons.

She is to be taken forthwith into dock to be coppered, and to be got ready for the pendant ; and it is expected she will be commissioned in a few days. From her appearance there is every probability of her proving a fast sailer.

She will embark two subalterns of the Royal Marines at Plymouth, for a passage to join the Pique and Spartan, in the place of Lieutenants Davies and Snowe, invalided from those ships.

Ships at Spithead.— The Warspite and Eurydice.

PORTSMOUTH, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1843.

The Eurydice, 26, Captain G. Elliot;, sailed this morning tor the West India Station, calling at Plymouth. She will convey orders for a small frigate — most probably the Spartan-to go to the Mediterranean, in the same manner as the Inconstant 36, sends the Pique, 36, to the same station ; and we understand all the vessles on the West India Station, are to be shifted to other quarter at the end of eighteen months. The Eurydice answers delightfully, and beat the Warspite in every point of sailing in the late cruise.
