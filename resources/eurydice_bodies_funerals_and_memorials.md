THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

DISCOVERY OF ANOTHER BODY.

A telegram last night states that the Dover and and Calais steamboat had picked up the body of a sailor, doubtless one of the crew of the Eurydice.

FUNERAL OF CAPTAIN FERRIER.

On Saturday afternoon the remains of Captain J. G. L. Ferrier, RE., of Bellside, Linlithgowshire, who was drowned by the sinking of the Eurydice, were interred with military honours in Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh. The burial service was read in St. John's Episcopal Church by the Bishop of Edinburgh, after which the procession went by way of Prince's-street, the Mound, and George IV. Bridge to the place of interment. The coffin, which was covered by the Union Jack, and on which were the deceased's hat and sword, with wreaths of *immortelles*, was conveyed on a gun-carriage drawn by six horses. Detachments of the 50th Regiment, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and the Royal Artillery took part in the procession. The streets along the route were crowded with spectators.

FUNERAL OF THE PETTY OFFICER AT HASLAR.

On Monday afternoon the body of George Andrew Bennett, the Petty Officer who was picked up either dead, or in a dying condition, by the Emma schooner, was interred in the pretty little cemetery at Haslar. The body, it will probably be remembered, was removed from Ventnor to the Haslar Royal Naval Hospital on the day after the inquest and was kept as long as possible, in hopes of other bodies being found, so that a number of the crew might have been buried together. No additional bodies, however, have been recovered, and further delay being considered inexpedient, the interment was fixed for Monday. The day was exceedingly fine, and the sun, which shone brightly, seemed to bring into greater prominence the sad surroundings of the occasion. Soon after two o'clock detachments of seamen and petty officers from the flagship, *Duke of Wellington*, the *Asia* (flagship of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Fitzgerald A. C. Foley), and the Thunderer landed at the Haslar Jetty, and, accompanied by a firing party of Marines from the Duke of Wellington, proceeded to the dead-house, on the grade plot, outside of which several relations and friends had congregatcd. The word dead-house, as a rule, carries with it the idea of an ugly building, dark, close, and stuffy. The one at Haslar, however, is a model of its kind. It is not at all unsightly, either as regards its external or internal appearances, and is light and airy. Seats are placed in the lobby for the accommodation of mourners, and here the widow and other relatives and friends of the deceased who had come from his late home near Bognor were awaiting the arrival of the funeral party. In addition to the ordinary number of seamen told off to attend the funeral, several petty officers and seamen volunteered to attend and pay a last tribute of respect to one of their number, and it is hardly necessary to say their request was granted. One of the men who thus attended-Lawton, captain of the forecastle of the Thunderer-was an old shipmate of the deceased. After the men had been drawn up they were allowed to break off for a few moments and take a farewell look of the deceased before the coffin was finally closed. The large majority of the party availed themselves of the opportunity. The deceased was a fine, stalwart fellow-a splendid specimen of a British sailor-and was about 30 years of age. Although he had been dead more than a week there was little change perceptible, and there was no trace of suffering stamped on his features. On the contrary, his face bore a tranquil and placid expression, which it was somewhat difficult to associate with the harrowing nature of the terrible event which had such a fatal ending. A number of flowers had been tastefully arranged around the head of the dead man. The coffin was a stained deal one, studded with black nails, and the breast-plate bore the following inscription:—

R. I. P.  
GEORGE ANDREW BENNETT, P.O.,  
Captain of the Quarter-deck, H.M.S. Eurydice,  
Drowned by the capsizing of that ship off Dunnose,  
March 24th, 1878.

A Union Jack formed the pall, and the coffin was carried to the hearse by six blue-jackets. For some reason the corpse was not conveyed on a gun-carriage, as is usual in naval funerals. The cortege was headed by the firing party of marines, with arms reversed. There was no band, it being understood that the widow did not desire one. Next came the hearse, behind which followed, on foot, the widow of the deceased, his sister, brother-in-law, and a few other relatives and friends of the deceased, including two Petty Officers-Jones and Evans-from the Osborne. Then followed the detachments of the crews of the Duke of Wellington, Asia and Thunderer, numbering altogether about 170. The whole party was under the command of Lieutenant John G. Haggard, of the *Duke of Wellington*. The other officers Present were Sub-Lieutenants Wm. M. Oxley and Willingham Franklin, Mr. John Hills, gunner, and Mr. Wm. Aldridge, boatswain, of H.M.S. *Duke of Wellington**; Lieutenant George Izat and Mr. Thomas A. King, boatswain, of *H.M.S. Asia*; Lieutenant Robert H. Stewart, Lieutenant Arthur B. Shakespeare, R.M.A., Sub-Lieutenant Henry E. Rooper, Engineer George E. Foote, Assistant-Engineer William H. Riley, Mr Patrick Barry, boatswain, Mr. Martin Jackson, boatswain, and Mr James Farrell, boatswain, of *H.M.S. Thunderer*. The procession moved slowly out of the main gates, a number of the inmates being congregated in the grounds to see it pass, and wended its way slowly along the road to the cemetery. Several civilians followed the *cortège*, but the number would, doubtless, have been far greater had the date of the burial been generally known. On arriving at the cemetery the marines formed up on either side of the gateway, and the coffin was borne on the shoulders of half-a-dozen blue-jackets to the gates, where it was met by the Rev. Fredk. W. Nicholl, M.A., the Hospital Chaplain, who preceded the body to the Mortuary Chapel,reading from the Burial Service the glad tidings of the Resurrection. A portion of the seamen entered the chapel and the remainder proceeded to the grave, whither the body was borne at the completion of the service in the chapel. Some twenty or thirty graves have been dug in the plot of ground which has been marked out for the reception of the bodies, and the first graves have been dug almost immediately adjoining the monument erected over the spot where the victims of the *Thunderer* catastrophe were interred. Into one of these the coffin was lowered. The remaining portion of the Burial Service was then gone through, and at its conclusion, the widow and other relatives took a farewell look at the coffin. The customary three volleys were fired into the air by the Marines, and the funeral party then reformed and marched back to Haslar Jetty, where they embarked in the boats and returned to their respective ships. In anticipation of a large number of the general public attending a detachment of Metropolitan Police was told off by Mr. Inspector Coppin, the Chief Officer at Haslar, for duty at the Cemetery, but on account of the comparative smallness of the number of persons who collected their services were scarcely required.

THE EURYDICE.

A correspondent of the *Devenport Independent* writes:- There are many distressing cases of bereavement and suffering here. In one a poor woman in Devonport, who lost a father, mother, and two children in 14 months, actually left the town early on Monday morning to be in Portsmouth to receive her husband, and only learnt the harrowing news on the road, when she returned a widow. In another case a young woman went round to be married to one of the young men ; she has been brought back in such a condition, from shock sustained to the system, that her life is despaired of. A third case is that of a poor woman in Devonport, who, four months ago lost her husband in the Narcissus ; whilst her husband was in that ship she lost and buried seven children; and in the Eurydice had lost her only remaining child and her only support. A hardhearted act has oome to my knowledge concerning this poor woman. She is fortunately entitled to £17 for the back pay of her deceased husband, and on Monday she went to a certain clergyman—a curate—and asked him to sign a certificate of her marriage, in order to get the money. Notwithstanding that she explained to him the distressing circumstance in which she was paced, he demanded 2s. 6d. of her. She told him that she had not got the money, whereupon he refused his signature without the fee. The poor woman was obliged to borrow the money, which she obtained through a friend. Returning to the clergyman she *purchased* the certificate, but it was necessary for her to remind the rev. gentleman that he had to give her 6d. change to the 3s. she had tendered in payment! "And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover a multitude of sins."

THE LOSS OF THE "EURYDICE."

On Saturday afternoon the remains of Captain J. G. L. Ferrier, R.E., of Bellside, Linlithgowshire, who was drowned by the sinking of the Eurydice, were interred with military honours in Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh. Detachments of the 50th Regiment, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and the Royal Artillery took part in the procession. The streets along the route were crowded with spectators.

The remains of Lieutenaut Tabor, which, after the inquest at Ventnor, were conveyed to Cheam, Surrey, the residence of his family, were interred in Cheam Churchyard on Friday afternoon. The corpse was followed by the Rev. R S. Tabor, the father, and the brother and sister of the deceased, Mrs Tabor, the wife of the gallant officer, being present at the church and grave. The coffin was covered by the Union Jack, a fitting pull, flowers forming a cross, and *immortelles*. The service, which was partly choral, was conducted by the rector, the Rev. C. H. Rice, assisted by several other clergymen. Despite the terrible weather, a large number of persons were present, comprising many of the resident gentry. Captain Fellowes, of the Royal Naval College, re-presented the Admiralty.

The remains of George Arthur Bennett were interred in the cemetery at Haslar, close by the spot at which the victims of the explosion on board the Thunderer were buried. The fuueral was a very quiet affair. No band attended, but a firing party of Marines, and a number of blue-jackets who had volunteered from the various ships in harbour, were present. The spectators were very few. The servioe was conducted by the Rev. Mr. Nickolby, chaplain to the hospital.

FOUNDERING OF H.M.S. EURYDICE.

The prevalence of high winds and strong tides have prevented anything like successful operations being carried out by the authorities engaged in the attempt to raise the Eurydice. The efforts of the party are by no means relaxed, and advantage is taken of every opportunity which presents itself. Four bodies, however, have been m recovered since Saturday. The first was that of a marine named George Falconer, which was observed by the Coastguardsmen at St. Lawrence, early on Sunady afternoon. The body was brought ashore by a boat which the Coastguard put off in, and the Isle of Wight Coroner being communimcated with, he did not consider an inquest necessary. Yesterday morning three other bodies were picked up near the Noman Fort and the Warner lightship, by Geofg Connor, flsherman, of Gosport, John Gawn, a boatman, of Portsmouth, and Joseph Briggs. Two of the bodies Were taken to the Gosport shore, and landed at the Coastguard jetty, where they were received by Mr. Stephen George, the Chief Officer of the station.. The officials at Haslar Hospital were communicated with and Inspeetor-General W.T. Domville, C.B., M.D., had coffins sent down to the jetty, and the bodies were conveyed in them to the dead-house at the Hospital. In order that there should be no delay in the identification of the corpses, Mr. Superintendent Cheyney communicated by telegraph with the County Coroner (Edgar Goble, Esq.), who decided to hold the inquest on the bodies at once. The Jury were, in consequence, hastily summoned, and met at Haslar Hospital last evening. The two bodies were identified by Charles Carter, foreman of labourers at the Hospital, who stripped them, and found the names of the men upon the clothing. The bodies were those of Edward Lockett and William E. Sandy, ordinary seamen, second class. An excellent arrangement has been made for the identification of the bodies. The Inspector-General has had a complete list made of the whole of the crew and passengers of the Eurydice-321 in number. The names marked on the clothing of the bodies recovered are compared with this list, and providing there is no other way of recognizing the corpses, identification can be established by this means. Both bodiee were much decomposed, the flesh being entirely removed from the faces, and the hands were also missing. Sandy had on a serge, a flannel, a check shirt, his trousers, &c.; and Lockett had on two flannels and a check shirt and trowsers. The lower jaw of Sandy was a entirely gone. In his trowsers pocket were found one penny piece, three halfpence, and two buttons. Formal evidence of identification was taken, and the inquest was adjourned to the date originally fixed, the 23rd inst. The men who recovered the bodies were bound over to appear then, and also, the two survivors — Benjamin Cuddeford and Sidney Fletcher, the latter being sick, a patient in Haslar Hospital. The funeral of the two men will take place this (Wednesday) afterneon. The third body, which was landed on the Portsmouth side of the harbour, was conveyed in a shell to the dead-house adjoining Portsea police-station. As it had been landed within the jurisdiction of the Borough Coroner, it was thought that an inquest would be held by that gentleman, but it appears that this duplication of depositions is not likely to occur, as the Coroner expressed a desire that if the Chief-Constable were satisfied that the body had come from the Eurydice, it might be conveyed to a Haslar, as he considered it inexpedient that inquiries should be opened in various parts of the county on the same matter. The body, although not identified up to last night, has no doubt come from the ill-fated ship. It has on a pair of laced boots, brown socks, blue cloth trowsers whiteshirt, and drawers, and short blue serge jacket. This latter article leads to the supposition that the body is either that of an officer's servant or steward. At all events he evidently belonged to the non-combatant class. The bones of the head were perfcetly bare, and both bands had been eaten off. The flesh had also come off a considerable portion of the right arm, the bones of which were bared for several inches. The corpse will be removed to Haslar, where it will be stripped, and identification will no doubt be established by the marking of the clothing. Nothing was found in the pockets of the deceased.

FUNERAL OF THE MARINE.

Our Ventnor correspondent telegraphs last night that the funeral of George Falconer, the marine whose body was picked up off Ventnor on Sunday, took place yesterday  afternoon. The hearse containing the body was followed from the Esplanade to Ventnor Cemetery by Captain Roche, R.N., Inspecting-Commander of St. Catherine's Division,; Mr. Clarke, Chief Officer of Ventnor Station; and about twenty Coastguardmen of the Division; fifty-five men of the 5th Isle of Wight Rifle Volunteers (which was a very good muster, considering the short notice given, and the funeral taking place during the working hours), under the command of Captain G. N. Burt and Lieutenant Henry Owen. The *cortège* was headed by the a Battalion band playing the Dead March in *Saul*. Many leading inhabitants of the town also followed in the procession and the greatest sympathy and respect was manifested by the numerous bystanders as the mournful *cortège* wound its way up the circuitous roads leading to the heights ahove Ventnor, on which the Cemetery is situated. The burial service was impressively read by the Rev. W. W. Willan. The firing party of the Volunteers fired three volleys over the grave at the conclusion of the service.

Mr. B. J. Physick, sculptor, has been commissioned to execute the monument in memory of Lieutenant Frank Tabor, R.N., who, it will be remembered, was picked up in an exhausted condition, and expired shortly after. The memorial will be erected over the grave in Cheam churchyard, Surrey, and the design prepared by Mr. Physick is appropriate as a memento of the sad circumstances which cause its erection.

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

...

On Tuesday morning, about 11 o'clock, John Gawn, a fisherman of Portsmouth, while near the Warner light, picked up the body of a seaman belonging to the Eurydice. Just before that time George Comer, a fisherman, of Gosport, had picked up another body near the same spot. Both bodies were towed into harbour and were taken to the Gosport Coastguard station, to which place a handcart and coffins were conveyed from Haslar Hospital, and the bodies were placed in them and taken to the dead-house at that place. One of the bodies was that of a young man whose name is supposed to be William Hendy. Both bodies are in a very advanced stage of decomposition.

The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh have forwarded to the Lord Mayor a donation of £ 100 towards the support of the widows, orphans, and dependant relatives of the men who lost their lives in the Eurydice.

Mr. E. J. Physick, sculptor, has been commissioned to execute the monument in memory of Lieut. Frank Tabor, R.N., who was picked up in an exhausted condition, and expired shortly after the sinking of H M.S. Eurydice. The memorial will be erected over the grave in Cheam churchyard, Surrey, and the design prepared by Mr Physick is singularly appropriate as a memento of the sad circumstances which caused its erection.

FOUNDERING OF H.M.S EURYDICE.

RECOVERY OF MORE BODIES.

The continued prevalonce of boisterous weather, has militated greatly against the efforts of those engaged in the work of raising the wreck. The working parties go out to the wreck at every favourable opportunity, but up to the preseent there are no new factors of any interest to be recorded in connection with the operations. We understand that several bodies have been washcd ashore at Bosbam, near Chichester, and an inquest has been opened.

On Saturday, an inquest was held at Hasler on two other bodies which had been picked up. Just before the Jury viewved the two bodies, another one was brought in, viz., that of Lieutenant Stanley A. B. Burney, who was picked up and landed at the Isle of Wight. An inquest, however, was not considered becessary by the Coroner within whose jurisdiction the body was landed, and it was, therefore, conveyed to Haslar. It was identified by Staff-Captain Alfred Balliston, of the Royal yacht Alberta. The recognition was established by means of the deceased's watch, upon which his name was engraved. To identify the bodies by their features is now simply impossible, as nothing but the bare skulls remained. One of the other of bodies proved to be that of John Curd, ordinary seaman, second class. There woer no marks upon the clothing of the other corpse by which it could bea identified but the missing link was supplied by Benjamin Cuddeford, one of the survivors, who identified the body as that of John Mitchell, captain of the forceastle of the starboard watch. The identification was made by means of tattoo marks upon the armns of the deceased. During the inquest on Saturday, whilist one of the hospital men, who have to strip the bodies, was giving evidenc as to the name found on the clothing, a juror, Mr. Jonathan Vincent, said he thought the men engaged in such work were entitled to some extrat remuneration, for their task was indeed most unpleasant. The Coroner said the matter had not escaped his notice, and he should be most happy to endorse any observation of the Jury's in that direction to the proper authorities. —On Sunday afternoon the body of John Mitchell was buried with full naval honours, the corpse being drawn to the cemetery on a gun carriage drawn by seamen, behind which the widow and two of her children followed.
 
THE LATE CAPTAIN FERRIER, R.E.-The following General Order was issued by Major-General Sir Robert M. Laffan, Governor of Bermuda, on April 17:-" It is with feelings of great regret that  His Excellency the Major-General Commander-in-Cheif has to announce to this garrison that official intelligence has been received concerning the sad news of the death of Captain LoiusFerrirer, Royal Engineers, who was so lately serving in this command. This officer was drowned off the coast of the Isle of Wight, on the afternoon of Sunday, March 24, 1878, owing to the foundering of H.M.S. Eurydice. His Excellency feels that in Captain Ferrier the Service has loast a very promising officer, whose professional merits were enhanced by an amiability of disposition and geniality of manner which rendered him popular with his men and a favourite with his brother officers."

FUNERAL OF LIEUT. BURNEY.

Yesterday afternoon the remains of Lieut. Stanley Alfred Brooke Burney, the only officer whose body has been recovered from the wreck, were interred in the pretty little cemetery at Haslar with every demonstration of respeact and esteem for the deceased offilcer's memory. The weather was exceedingly squally, and a heavy shower fell during the progress of the cortege to the burial ground. The late Lieut. Burney was one of the most promising officers of the Service, and his geniality of disposition, added to his kindliness of manner to all those with whom he was associated, made him a most popular officer. Under these circumstances therefore, it was but natural that a large number of both officers and men belonging to the Service should attend his funeral obsequies. The deceased, who was only 23 years of age, passed his eamination with honours (technically speaking he passed in the three ones) and thus gained his commission as a Lieutenant. He was the soon of Commander Charles Burney, the Superintendent of Greenwich Hospital School, by whom, on attaining his commission, he was presented with a watch, the inscription on which proved the means of identifying the body when it was recovered. The deceased was educated at the scholastic establishment of the Rev. Edward Burney, and well known in the neighbourhood. A younger brother is now studying at the same academy, a second is at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and a third is at Sandhurst. The late Lieut. Burney was specially chosen for his attainments as one of the officers of the ill-fated Eurydice.Soon after half-past two the funeral cortege left Haslar Hospital, the way being led by a firing party of 100 privates, 5 sergeants, 5 corporals, and 2 buglers of tRoyal Marines, drawn from the Duke of Wellington, Asia, and Excellent, under the command of Captain Hugh W. Bamber of H.M.S. Asia.  Next came the band of the St. Vincent, playing hte Dead March in Saul, and behind the band the corpse was conveyed on a gun carriage drawn by 16 blue-jackets. A Union Jack covered the coffin, and the pall bearers were: Staff-Commander George A. MacFarlane,of H. M. S. Hercules; Commander Edward G. Hulton, of H M.S. Narcissus, and a Lieutenant from the Duke of Wellington, Monarch, Asia and Excellent. Immediately behinf the corpse the following gentlemen walkeda as mourners:— Captain Charles Burney (father of the deceased); Messrs. Cecil, Ernest, and Percy Burney (brothers); Staff-Captain Alfred Balliston, Royal yacht Alberta; Col. Longmore, Capt. Colclough, and Mr. R. Wilkinson. Next followed about 160 blue jackets, under the command of Lientenant-Edgar R. Mathias, the rear being brought up by about fifty officers, including Lieutenants, Sub-Lieutenants, Midshipman, oofficers of the Royal Marine Light Infantry and Royal Marine Artillery, the  party being made up of representatives from all the ships in harbour. The Port Admiral, who was absent from the town, was represented by Flag-Lieutenant Hugh G. Gough. Inspector-General W. T. Domville, C.B., M.D., was also present, and Captain the Hon. Walter C. Carpenter, of the flag-ship Duke of Wellington. Amongst those who followed to show their respect to the deceased officer's memory, were a number of his old shipmates; among these were Commander Harry T. Grenfell, who was formerly Flag-Lietenant to Admiral Cochrane, in the Pacific; the Rev. George M. Sutton, B.A.. of H.M.S. Warrior, who was formerly in the Repulse, with the deceased, and also Lieutenants Edward J. Sanderson, H.M.S. Crocodile, Spencer B. Hesketh, and Robert C. Sparkes; Sub-Lieutenants Lionel G. Tufnell and Ingram. There were also present Colour-Sergeant James Murphy, Royal Marine Light Infantry, of H.M.S. Crocodile, who formerly served on board the same ship as the deceased,  and a numbe of petty officeris and seamen who had also served with him. On the procession arriving at the Cemetery the firing party formed up on either side of the road, and allowed the corpse to pass into the grounds, where it wast met by the Rev. Frederick W. Nickokll, M.A., Chaplain to Haslar Hospital, who preceded the body into the mortuary chapel, repeating the introductory sentences of the Burial Service. After the religious ceremony in the chapel, the procession re-formed, and proceeded to the grave, which is one of the centre ones in the plot of ground marked out for the reception of the bodies recovered from the wreck. Here the Burial Service was proceeded with, and concluded, and at the close the customary three volleys were fired over the grave, and the funeral party re-formed and returned to their respective ships. The coffin was of polished oak, with Mediaeval mountings, and was supplied by Mr. Miller, undertaker, of High-street, who had charge of the funeral arrangements. A number of metropolitan police, under the command of Mr. Inspector Coppin, were present to keep the ground.

THE EURYDICE.

The inclement weather of the last few days has kept the operations of the wreck in complete obeyance. It is now hoped that the tides will sufficiently answer *within a fortnight* to enable the attempt to be made to lift the Eurydice ! A waterman has succeeded in up Captain Hare's writing desk, and handed it over to the Coastguard at Bembridge, by whom it was forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief. The gales have disturbed the banks of sand and freed many bodies – several of which have been recovered.

On Saturday two more bodies which were decomposed beyond recognition, picked up near the wreck, were, brought into Portsmouth harbour by the steam tug Grinder and conveyed to Haslar Hospital One is evidently a seaman, thother is believed to be a marine. The Rinaldo reports that the body of an officer passed her as she lay anchored near the wreck on Friday night, but the sea was too rough for a boat to be lowered. The body subsequently washed ashore off Sea View, and has been identified as that of Lieutenant Barry. The south cone was hoisted at the semaphore on Saturday evening, and the gale which sprang up during the night prevented the tugs from proceeding out of harbour during Sunday. The squally weather and the heavy gale from the W.S.W. will, it is expected, tend to ease the position of the the wreck, and lead to large numbers of bodies floating through the ports.

THE EURYDICE.

The funeral of the late Lieutenant S. A. B. Burney was held at Haslar Cemetery on Tuesday afternoon in a spot which has been selected for the officers whose bodies may be recovered from the wreck of the Eurydice. The corpses of the crew are being buried in a plot of ground adjoining the square in which the sufferers from the Thunderer explosion are laid, and the spots which have been chosen for the graves of the officers lie on each side of the middle line, and contiguous to the site on which it is proposed to raise a memorial of the disaster. Lieut. Burney was buried with naval honours, the funeral cortege being composed of a couple of officers in full dress and of the aame rank as the deceased, and twenty bluejackets from each man-of-war in the harbour, headed by a firing party of 100 rank and file from the Boyal Marines, under the command of Captain Bsmber, and the band of Her Majesty'a ahip St. Vincent, which played Dead Marchea to the Cemetery. The father of the deceased, Captain Burney (Superintendent of the Greenwich Hospital Schools), and hia three sons were the chief mourners, and were followed by the Rev. E. Burney, Captain Balliston, of the Alberta, and a number of personal frienda in and out of uniform. The coffin having been covered with a Union Jack and placed on a gun carriage, was drawn to the Cemetery by seamen of the fleet, the pall being supported by Commander Hulton, Staff-Commander Macfarlane, and four senior lieutenants. The funeral service was read by the Rev. F. W. Nickoll, the chaplain of the hospital, and the usual three volleys were fired over the grave. Lieutenant Burney, who was only 23 at the time of his death, joined the Eurydice on her being commissioned for the special service on which she was employed, having just previoualy gained his lieutenant's commission as a reward for passing a highly satisfactory examination at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. He was considered one of the most promising young officers in the service, and his loss is deeply deplored by his friends and relatives. His body was picked up on Saturday morning by a pilot boat about a couple of miles out to sea to the eastward of the wreck, and was landed at Sea View, Isle of Wight, and thence conveyed to Haslar Hospital. The body was identified by means of a gold watch, which bore an inscription showing that it had been presented to the deceased by his father on obtaining his lieutenant's commission. The tugs and divers went out to the wreck of the Eurydice on Wednesday morning, but in consequence of a heavy swell prevailing at the back of the Wight they returned again into harbour. Hicks, the shipwright diver, made a descent, and found that the result of the late gales had been to bring the upper sill of the lee ports on a level with the mud bottom. The channels are now within 1ft. of the sea floor, and as the ship retains the same angle of heel, it is evident that she has sunk 2 1/2ft. further into the ground, that the lee ports are now wholly under the sand, and that she is fast making a hole for herself. During the high tide of Tuesday a diver's boat was stove in, and one ofthe mooring lighters received a great deal of injury and was nearly swamped. On Wednesday morning the body of Albert C. Doogood. an ordinary seaman of the first class, was landed at Sea View, Isle of Wight, by a pilot boat, and afterwards taken to Haslar.

*To the Editor of the Hampshire Advertiser.*

Sir,— Will you kindly oblige by correcting an error in your paper of to-day respecting the picking up of the body of Lieut. S. A. B. Burney of H.M S Eurydice, by the Coastguard at Sea View. The facts are that the body was picked up at sea by the Emma, pilot cutter, of this place, brought here, and given in charge of the chief boatman, who telegraphed to the Admiralty at Portsmouth. A Government seam tug was at once sent, wbich took the body to Portsmouth. I am, sir, your obedient servant,  
Henry Knapp, pilot,  
Emma, pilot cutter.  
Clyde Villa, Sea View, Isle of Wight

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

Writing from Portsmouth on Saturday, a says:—

Within the last ten days no fewer than sixteen bodies from the Eurydice have been picked up. Eight had been recovered up to Thursday. On Friday six were found in the neighbourhood of Chichester, and on Saturday two were brought in to Portsmouth Harbour. One of three was the body of George Curd, an ordinary seaman, which was identified by the name on the jacket; and the other was the body of John Mitchell, a chief petty officer and seaman gunner which was identified by his widow by some tattoo marks on his arm.

ESCAPE OF A RYDE MAN FROM THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

A young man named Hayes, whose mother was a member of the Sivell family of this town, had a very fortunate escape from being lost in the ill-fated ship. About a week before the vessel sailed from the West Indies, Hayes was taken ill, and had to be taken on shore to the hospital. His friends at first thought he was drowned, but a letter has, since the disaster, been received, which announced the gratifying fact that Hayes is alive and restored to health.

THE EURYDICE.

Conclusion of the Inquests.— On Wednesday last Mr. Edgar Goble, one of the coroners for Hants, concluded the inquiries into the death of the unfortunate men drowned in the Eurydice. The evecvidence was confined to that of the survivors, Cuddiford and the boy Sydney Fletcher. There narratives were subetantially the same as those admitted by them at previous inquiries. Some new facts, however, were advanced. Cuddiford stated that there was not the slightest indication of the sqluall coming on before the Ship was struck, and he did not thnk the wind headed her during the whole time. To the last the captain gave his orders in a clear and distinct voice, and at the time the ship went down all the ports were open except two. They were opened in the forenoon by the orders of the mate of the deck, and the ship at about the time she struck was going at about eight knots. From the time the order was given to shorten sail to the time she heeled over about six minutes elapsed. From the time she heeled over to going down was only a few minutes. The captain was on deck the whole of the afternoon, and in witness's opinion everything was done to save the ship. He believed that none of the four guns broke loose. The ship was more lively than usual from the amount of water and provisions consumed, but if they had consumed all the water the ship would have been properly ballasted. He did not believe that Captain Hare was aware that the ports were open. Considering the state of the weather he was of the opinion that the ship was in a safe condition. She was not under too great a press of sail previous to the storm. Mr. Gifford, a sub-lieutenant, was at the wheel, but there was always a quartermaster there. As a seaman of 21 years experience, he believed that no blame attached to either officers or men for the loss of the ship. The Coroner, in concluding the inquiry, said the Admiralty did not propose to offer any scientific evidence. It would be for the jury to say whether the captain had caused a proper look-out to kept, because if he had not it would amount to a neglect of duty, for which he would have had to answer had he survived. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased came to their deaths by drowning through the foundering of the Eurydice, but that no blame attached to the captain, officers, or crew.

Another body has been recovered from the wreck—that of C. Wilkins, one of the crew, found in the forechains. In opening the enquiry, the Coroner (E. Goble, Esq.) observed that the body upon which evidence would be given was supposed to be one of the crew of the Eurydice, and his clothes were marked "C. Wilkins." It would be the duty of the jury to inquire whether the identity of the deceased had been proved to their satisfaction, and also to ascertain the cause of death. It was not his intention at present to go into any further inquiry. They had received the verdict of two juries with regard to this catastrophe, and therefore all they need now do was to prove the identity of the body and find the cause of death.

George Carter, foreman of the laborers at the Hospital, said the body was brought to the Hospital that day by some laborers of the Dockyard. He gave formal evidence as to the clothes which were worn by the deceased, and which proved his identity, the name being on the waistband and trousers. The deceased was picked up in the forechains of H.M.S. Eurydice.

Inspector-General Domville handed in the card from the Admiralty, stating that C. Wilkins was a seaman on board the Eurydice —The inquiry was adjourned.

TWO BODIES FOUND.

On Saturday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, two bodies were washed ashore near to Sir William Hutt's pier at Apley ; one of the bodies was headless, but a human head was found floating near the spot. The bodies were in a very advanced state of decomposition, and almost nude, so that there were no means of identification ; but there is little doubt that they were from the ill-fated Eurydice. Coffins were procured, and the bodies conveyed by the Coastguard to the mortuary at the Cemetery. At half-past 5 in the afternoon the funeral took place at the north side of the Cemetery. Palls were thrown over the coffins, which were carried, shoulder high, by eight Coastguardsmen, under the superintendence of Mr. Jefferys, the chief officer. They were met at the grave (both being interred in one) by Mr. Westhall, a gentleman residing in Ryde, who read portions of Scripture. and afterwards addressed the large concourse of people, remarking that it was a very solemn occasion, and took their thoughts back to the 24th March, when about 300 poor men and boys were drowned by the capsizing of the Eurydice; the bodies of two of them were in the coffins before them ; there were no names on the coffins, but the men were known to God. He nothing of their history, and he did not know whether they were Christians, and he had nothing to do with that. They were surrounded by mysteries ; even their own existence was a mystery, and it was a most mysterious thing that the poor creatures who were drowned would have been on land in about an hour, and would have boon welcomed by loving friends; but it was not to be. They could not understand it, but the light of eternity would interpret all mysteries, and all they had to do was to bow to the will of God, for would not the Judge of the whole earth do right? The lesson for all of them to learn was the uncertainty of human life. Those who were drowned were in good health and spirits a few minutes before, and then were called to their final account. There were these present who evidently had sympathy for those who had been thus taken suddenly away. Although they were taken thus suddenly, it was possible they might have been able to give one look to the Saviour, and there was life in a look. It did not take long to save the thief on the cross, and they might hope that many in the Eurydice were saved, and he was glad to believe that many on board loved the Saviour. Mr. Westhall concluded the simple, but very impressive, service by offering prayer and pronouncing the benediction. There was something exceedingly affecting in witnessing the two plain, nameless coffins placed in the grave, and no friends or relatives near to pay the last tribute of affection ; and also in the thought that until the morning of the resurrection it must remain a profound secret as to who was interred in Ryde Cemetery on Saturday afternoon.

SANDOWN, April 12.

...

Eurydice Memorial.— The subscription set on foot for the purpose of erecting a memorial to the seven seamen who were drowned in the Eurydice disaster, and whose bodies were washed on shore at Sandown, has been very successful. Sufficient funds were collected to obtain a very handsome monument, which has just been completed by Mr. J. Ellery, of Ryde, and erected in Sandown Churchyard. It is of Portland stone, and consists of a pedestal 3ft. 6in. high, which stands on a moulded base, with two steps surrounding it. The whole is about 4ft. 6in. high. On the four sides of the pedestal are sunken panels, surmounted with appropriate emblems. On each side of the pedestal is an inscription. That on the east is as follows : — " Sacred to the memory of seven brave seamen of Her Majesty's Navy, who lie buried here, after having first found a watery grave on Sunday, March 24th, 1878, when H.M.S. Eurydice foundered in a terrific squall off Sandown Bay." On the north side the names of those known are stated, viz., D. Harvey, J. T. Smith, W. Shuker, H. Veals. The names of the others buried here are unknown. The other sides of the memorial have appropriate texts of Scripture.

The Eurydice.

A handsome tablet has been placed in the chapel of the dockyard at Portsmouth, by permission of the Admiralty, and is a fine specimen of the sculptor's art. On a tablet of jet black marble is a cross and anchor and cable resting on rock covered with seaweed, and beneath a scroll in white block marble, the latter bearing the following inscription, surmounted by the word " Eurydice," and having underneath the crest and motto of the deceased:— "In affectionate remembrance of Francis Hope Tabor, Lieutenant Royal Navy, who was drowned by the capsizing of H.M.S. Eurydice off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, March 24th, I878, this tablet was erected by the officers of the ships in which he had served."

A CURIOUS INClDENT.—connected with the loss of H.M.S. Eurydice has just occurred at Brighton. Amongst those who were reported as having perished in that ill-fated vessle was a lad named Merchant, and, a lad of the same same having left his home in Brighton a long time previously in order to join that ship, his friends, who had not heard from him since he left home, mourned for him as dead, believing, as the name and initial were the same, and as the descriptions corresponded, that it was their son who was lost. Nearly twenty months had elapsed since the disaster, when greatly to their surprise, the lad who was regarded as dead long since walked into his home alive and well, having travelled 65,000 miles since he had set forth. It appeared that, instead of joining the Eurydice, he had joined another ship, and finally had reached England in the Shah, after having visited the four continents. He had not written home either from want of opportunity or indifference.

MEMORIAL OF H.M.S. EURYDICE.

On Wednesday afternoon, in the presence of a numerous crowd of spectators, a monument to the memory of the officers and crew of tho ill-fated training ship, the Eurydice, which foundered, with the loss of over 300 officers, seamen, and boys, on March 24, 1878, was unveiled in Shanklin Cemetery, Isle of Wight, by Lady Isabel Atherley. The monument, which is the result of public subscription, was sculptured by Mr. F. J. Moyniham, of London, and consists of a naval trophy, wrought in Portland stone, and surmounted and partly shrouded in a canopy of naval flags. It is built so as to face Sandown Bay, the mouth of the cannon being pointed to the spot where the ill-fated vessel sank. On the front is a tablet, with the inscription, "To the memory of the officers and men of H.M.S. Eurydice, which foundered off Shanklin, March 24, 1878," and above it is a ribbon with raised letters, indicative of the ribbon on the caps of the crew of the vessel. Lieut. Langley, of H.M.S. Excellent, and other officers of the Navy, with petty officers, sailors, and marines of her Majesty's ships Orontes, St. Vincent, and Asia, represented her Majesty's Service, and the coastguards of the Isle of Wight, under their officers, also took part in the ceremony. The vicar of St. Saviour's, Shanklin (the Rev. C. J. Burland), delivered an address prior to the unveiling of the monument. He paid a high tribute to the memory of the brave men who lost their lives in the performance of their duty on the memorable 24th of March, and it was incidentally intimated that an impression was current that one of the seven unknown bodies which had been washed ashore at Shanklin, and over which this monument had been erected, was that of the gallant captain of the ill-fated ship. Colonel Atherley, Lieutenant Langley, and others also addressed the assembly, and the proceedings were of a deeply interesting character.

HER MAJESTY'S SHIP " EURYDICE."

In the pretty cemetery of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, on Wednesday afternoon, Lady Isabel Atherley veiled a fine monument, which has been erected there by public subscription, to the officers and men who perished by the foundering of the *Eurydice* off Shanklin, in March, 1878. Seven of the bodies were buried in this cemetery, among them, as many suppose, the body of Captain Hare, the commander. The monument has been erected from a design furnished by Mr. F. J. Moynihan, of Uxbridge-road. Many persons were present to witness the ceremony, after which Lieutenant Langley, on behalf the Naval Service, thanked the people of Shanklin for erecting so worthy a memorial to the gallant men who had perished amid such lamentable circumstances.

UNVEILING OF THE "EURYDICE" MEMORIAL AT SHANKLIN.

The pretty cemetery given to the pariah of Shanklin by Colonel Atherley was on Wednesday the 23rd ult., the scene of an interesting and deeply-impressive ceremony—the unveiling of a monument erected there to the memory of the Crew of the "Eurydice," which, with its precious freitage of some 300 young sailors, was suddenly whelmed beneath the waves in the awful gale of that fatal Sunday afternoon a little more than two years ago. The bodies of seven of the crew, washed up from the wreck are buried in Shanklin cemetery; the place, moreover, is within sight of the spot where the ship went down ; and it was fitting, therefore, that here should be raised an appropriate and enduring memorial to the brave officers and crew of the hapless vessel. Bright weather favoured the unveiling ceremony, which took place in the presence of a large gathering of persons, amongst whom were naval and coastguard officers and a number of bluejackets, representing, we were told, all Her Majesty's ships now in Portsmouth Harbour. Soon after half, past three a procession was formed at the cemetery lodge, a number of coastguardmen walking at the head, and following them were the surpliced choir and clergy of St. Saviour's-on-the Cliff, Col. and the Lady Isabel Atherley and friends, and the members of the Shanklin Burial Board. The procession first went to the Gate Chapel, one of the clergy saying the sentences from the Burial Office, and in the Chapel, the anthem "man that is born of a woman" was sung. The procession then moved towards the graves, the choir chanting the 29th and part of the 17th Psalms, at the close of which—the company present having formed into a circle round the graves—the beautiful and appropriate hymn, "Fierce raged the tempest o'er the deep, from " Hymns Ancient and Modern," was sung with marked feeling. Following this was an address very impressive and appropriate by the Rev. C. I. Borland, vicar of St. Saviour's, who said he believed that there was in seamen a strong instinctive feeling that whereever their bodies might be cast they had a yearning desire that those bodies should be committed to the dust, if possible with pious words, and with loving friends standing round. It was for this reason, he had been told, that it was very often the custom with them to mark their bodies, so that they might be identified when they were found. It was to them a melancholy satisfaction that they could rear this stone over the bodies of the brave. We did not know their names, but we knew that they belonged to a service which we highly honoured. It might seem strange to some that ministers of religion should speak with admiration of those whose duty it was to carry arms in the service of their country ; but he had no hesitation in feeling and expressing that admiration. No Christian man could read his Bible without feeling that war may sometimes be a very necessary evil, and it was often the case that war called forth some of the bravest and noblest qualities that were to be found in man. For himself he had no fear that Englishmen would ever be found wanting in the truest type of bravery, or that they would ever do discredit to the flag that had waved so long. He had the comforting conviction that our sailors and our soldiers were becoming brave with a higher bravery than the mere courage that would face the enemy. He believed more and more that there were in the army and the navy men who were imbued with simple piety, and who were not afraid to acknowledge Him, their Saviour, who, though the gentlest and the most loving, was ever the bravest of the brave, the noblest of the noble. Many were there who made it their pride to serve Him and to do His will. It had been told him that some had supposed that amongst the bodies buried here was that of the captain of the ill-fated Eurydice. If so, then here had they an illustration of what a sailor might be—brave and noble in the highest sense of those words, for he was brave and noble in the service of his Saviour. And they also knew that there were some precious relics left of that crew. There were not many, but they knew that in a little Sussex cottage there was a letter read with tearful eyes, and that letter indicated that amongst the young on board the vessel there was just that tone which all must have wished should be the case when they heard of that terrible catastrophe. "We have come here this afternoon," concluded the rev. speaker, " to unveil this memorial, and to show that we honour the profession to which these men belonged, and that we have a lively sympathy with our sailors in the perils and dangers which they are called upon to endure. We have come also to show that we feel a deep interest in all that concerns them, and that our inmost hearts are touched when our brave ones are suddenly called away. They are dear to us, though no stone may tell their names, their worth, their glory ; but a record of their lives in hearts that love them well. These men, as much as those who fall in battle, fell in the path of duty and is the service of their country, and they belong to that noble band of heroes whose names and deeds grace our British story."

A prayer of dedication of the monument was then read by the Rev. F- Hummell, curate of St. Saviour's, as follows :

O Lord. at whose word the stormy wind ariseth, behold with Thy favour our memorial of these sailors, who sank with their ship almost in sight of home ; and mercifully grant that all who in pity shall read its record, may be led to ponder the uncertainty of this mortal life, and be stirred up to secure that life everlasting, which Thou has given us in our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.

Other appropriate prayers followed, and the Lady Isabel Atherley then unveiled the memorial by removing the Union Jack which had hitherto shrouded it from view.

The monument is of Portland stone, eight feet high, and the rockwork base is six feet by four feet. The base is surmounted by a naval trophy, consisting of crossed anchors and a cannon, with a snapped cable, a broken chain-link, and other fitting emblems, a Union Jack supplying the drapery. The cannon points to the spot where the Eurydice went down. On the front face of the monument is the inscription :

" To the memory of the officers and men of  
H.M.S. EURYDICE,  
which foundered off Shanklin,  
March 24, 1878,  
Seven of whom are buried here."

—and on the opposite side there is carved lettering as follows: 

" Erected by public subscription and unveiled by  
Lady Isabel Atherley,  
June 23rd, 1880."

—Immediately above this is a representation of the ribbon of a seaman's cap, with " H.M.S. Eurydice " upon it. The monument was designed by Mr. F. J. Moynihan, of London, assisted by Mr. A. Tyler, hon. sec. of the London committee, and the former gentleman executed the sculpture, which is strikingly effective and appropriate.

Col. Atherley, sfter the ceremony of unveiling was performed, addressed a few remarks to the company. He might say for Lady Isabel that she had experienced a feeling of satisfaction in being priviledged to take part in the tribute which had been paid that day to those brave men to whose memory that beautiful monument had been reared, and this satisfaction both as regarded his lady and himself was strengthened by the thought that there was about that place something which told of the kind and friendly feeling which existed between them and the inhabitants of Shanklin and its neighbourhood. He was sure he might say for Lady Isabel that she was always glad to be permitted to join those amongst whom she lived in doing any good and kindly work. The Colonel then referred in touching words to the calamity which occurred two years since in front of the windows of those who lived at Shanklin, and he added that the sorrow and the sympathy which were then called forth still lived—sorrow for those so suddenly and prematurely cut off, and sympathy for the bereaved relatives who had to mourn the loss of near and dear ones. Amongst the harrowing scenes which took place at the time was the casting up of the seven bodies which had found a resting-place in that Cemetery. Save in one instance, those bodies were unknown—unrecognised. After the interment a committee was formed for the purpose of erecting a suitable memorial ; but as the names of the bodies recovered were, with one exception, unknown, it was thought that the monument should be erected not to any particular persons, but to the memory of all the officers and crew, and to commemorate what was indeed a national calamity. To carry out this work a committee was formed in Shanklin, consisting of Messrs. Amon, F. Rayner, H. Sanders, R. T. Blew. Paybody, Tizard, Cantlow, and Humby, with himself as chairman, and under the able secretaryship of Mr. A. Tyler, a committee was formed in London, the members of which were Messrs. Robert Hewett (chairman), H. B. Clarke, W. Foster and J. Aldridge (of Leigh, Essex) C. J. James, and F. Meek. Mr. Tyler was instrumental in obtaining from the talented sculptor, Mr. Monyihan, a model of the memorial which had been just uncovered, and he thought they would all agree with him that in design and execution the work had been admirably carried out, and that the monument was in keeping with the event which it was intended to commemorate- After remarking that the Burial Board had in this instance waived their claim to the usual fees, the gallant colonel concluded by stating that, in the name of Lady Isabel, he declared the memorial unveiled. Might that monument stand there for many years, keeping fresh the memory of the brave crew of the Eurydice, and telling all who had to face the perils of the great waters that there were warm hearts on shore who deeply sympathised with them in the dangers which they were at times called upon to encounter. He was glad to see so many sailors present on that occasion. Amongst them were two naval officers, Lieut. Langley, of H.M.S. Excellent, and Lieut. Whiddon, of H.M.S. Crocodile, and he would ask one of then to say a few words.

Lieutenant Langley, R.N., stepped forward and said: Colonel and Lady Isabel Atherlev, on the part of the service to which I have the honour to belong I desire to thank you and all the subscribers for the beautiful monument which has been erected above the bodies of our poor comrades who died in the service of their country. Your kind act of this day will never be forgotten by the British Navy.

On the proposition of Mr. Nicholson, J.P., D.L. of Ventnor, an expression of thanks was conveyed' to the Lady Isabel Atherley for the part which she had so kindly and gracefully performed ; and Col. Atherley, after acknowledging the compliment, said they were greatly indebted to the clergy and choir of St. Saviour's for the impressive service which they had rendered, and which had invested the ceremony with an interest and solemnity that would not soon be forgotten.— After a few words in reply by the Rev. C. I. Burland, who spoke in high terms of his choir, the hymn " Eternal Father, strong to save," was sung, and the proceedings closed with the Benediction, pronounced by the Vicar of St. Saviour's.

Borland, vicar of St. Saviour's, who said he believed that there was in seamen a strong instinctive feeling that whereever their bodies might be cast they had a yearning desire that those bodies should be committed to the dust, if possible with pious words, and with loving friends standing round. It was for this reason, he had been told, that it was very often the custom with them to mark their bodies, so that they might be identified when they were found. It was to them a melancholy satisfaction that they could rear this stone over the bodies of the brave. We did not know their names, but we knew that they belonged to a service which we highly honoured.

"EURYDICE " MEMORIAL.

A very handsome memorial to the memory of those who foundered in H.M.S. Eurydice has just been completed in Hasiar Cemetery, over the spot where the bodies were buried, and facing a similar monument erected to the memory of the officers and men who were killed by the explosion on board the Thunderer. The memorial is very attractive, and somewhat novel in its design. The base is ao formed of about 12 inches of polished granite, is 23ft. by 11ft., and 10ft. high. It is four sided. Above the first portion of the base, the monument slopes upward and inward with a moulding of Portland stone. Above that rises the obelisk, which is intended to represent a rugged rock with the sea running over it in parts. The action of the water has rubbed it smooth in some parts, and in other places there is carving in imitation of sea weed. The top is surmounted by the anchor of the Eurydice, in a position nautically known as " fouled." The granite is of a dull grey kind, and has been prepared by convict labour at Chatham, and the Portland stone has been similarly dressed by the same means. On one side are the names of the officers in the centre of two rows of men's names. On one corner are the words " H.M.S. Eurydice," and on another side "Foundered March 24th, 1878." Just above the moulding of the obelisk are the texts: ": My God is the rock of my refuge," " I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea," "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul," and "A And the sea gave up the dead which were in it." Altogether the monument is 10ft. in height. On one side are 75 names, another 108; a third 71; and the fourth 62. The design is that of General Pasley. The monument has been erected under the direction of Mr. Carruthers, Assistant Civil Engineer attached to the Gosport works, and the builders were Messrs. Bramble Bros., Government contractors.

THE EURYDICE MEMORIAL AT HASLAR

It will be remembered that the bodies of the unfortunate officers and seamen which were recovered from the wreck of the *Eurydice* were laid to rest in Haslar Cemetery, near Gosport, each grave being marked with a simple headstone. A more imposing memorial, as represented in our engraving, has now been erected on the spot. It was designed by Colonel Parley, R.E., C.B., and erected by Mr. Carruthers, the Assistant Civil Engineer for Gosport, and Messrs. Bramble, the contractors for the work. The base, of bright granite, bears upon its sloping ledge the 316 names of those who went down with the ill-fated vessel on Sunday, March 24th, 1878, and above this is a moulding of Portland stone, each side of which contains an appropriate quotation from Scripture. This again is surmounted by a huge rocky superstructure, on the summit of which is the real anchor, shackle, and part of the ship's cable which was recovered from the scene of the disaster. The measurement at the base is 23 feet by 17 feet, and the height is 10 feet. Our engraving is from a photograph by G. West and Son, Gosport, copies of which have been purchased by Her Majesty the Queen.
