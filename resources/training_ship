SEAMANSHIP OF YOUNG SAILORS.

The Admiralty are about to take practical measures for improving the seamanship of our young sailors. At present a boy having served a certain time on board a training-ship is transferred to a flagship, where he becomes an ordinary seaman. He is then draughted to a sea-going ship, and may, under favourable conditions, become an expert and efficient seaman, knowing the name and use of every rope on board, and capable of turning his hands to anything that may be required in the severest weather. It may happen, however, that he is sent to a ram of Rupert type, or a mastless ship like the Devastation where he can learn little or nothing of his profession; and as vessels of these classes are increasing, and likely to increase, it is necessary that special measures should be taken to bestow a thorough sea training upon young seamen, so that they may find themselves at home, no matter what the character of the ship may be to which they are despatched. A step in the right direction has been taken by the fitting out of the Eurydice, a sixth-rate wooden fripate of the old class as a sea-going training-ship for ordinary seamen. The Eurydice is 140ft. in length between perpendiculars. 78ft. in extreme breadth, and 921 tons burthen, old measurement. When ready for commission she will furnish accommodation for 280 young seamen, in addition to her commander and staff of officers. She will carry six 64-pounder 71cwt. guns, mounted on rear truck carriages, three on each side of the main deck. She will be ship rigged, and will probably have an independent commander's commission. Before being draughted for service in sea-going ships young ordinary seamen will undergo a six months' practical training at sea on board the Eurydice, which is totally guiltless of machinery of any kind and it cannot be doubted that the professional schooling which they will thereby receive will go far to improve the efficiency of our seamen as sailors.

...

It has long been felt that an evil has arisen from a large number of ordinary seamen after being released from the restraint of the training ships being kept for a time in the depot ships at the home ports, previous to being drafted for foreign stations. To remedy this evil the Lords of the Admiralty have commissioned the Eurydice as a training ship at Portsmouth for ordinary seamen in the Channel. Thus while the men will be at home and available for foreign service they will be kept under proper training in a position where discipline can be properly maintained, and be saved from the temptations inseparable from nightly leave.

...

Eurydice, 4 training-ship for ordinary seamean, Captain Marcus A S. Hare. Mauh excitement prevailed Portsmouth during last week, consequent on a rumour that during the recent heavy gale this vessel lost her topmasts and topsail yard, and that several men were carried overboard with them and drowned. On inquiry we learn that nothing official is yet to hand. On the 17th of November all apprehensions were removed by the receipt of the following telegram:— "Eurydice, Lisbon, Friday, November l6ih. 8 55 p.m.—Arrived all well; will leave on the 24th. Send letters and papers to Barbadoes."
