FOUNDERING OF H.M.S. EURYDICE OFF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

FEARFUL LOSS OF LIFE.

PAINFUL EXCITEMENT THE TOWN AND DOCKYARD.

Since the memorable day in September, 187O, when H.M.S. Captain foundered off Cape Finisterre and when nearly all hands were drowned, no naval disaster has occurred of a nature so truly awful as that which it is our most painful duty to announce as having happened yesterday afternoon to H.M. training ship Eurydice, just as that ill-starred vessel was almost within sight of the harbour, where all on board were anxiously expecting the meeting of those the enforced separation from whom had been the chief cause of regret during the continuance of the voyage apparently so rapidly drawing to successful conclusion. The Eurydice was a training ship for youths of the rating of ordinary seamen, and every year it was the practice of the authorities to send her on deep sea cruise, for tha purpose of giving the young men forming her crew more thorough insight into their duties than any they could receive whilst quietly lying anchor in a land-locked harbour. Tho voyage from which she was returning had been made to the West Indies, and in addition to her crew, we have been informed that she had on board several time-expired men and invalids. We have telegraphed to London for a complete list, and trust to receive it in time for our third edition. So far as we have peon able to gather, she had favouring winds until she sighted the Lizard, and during her subsequent passage up the Channel until she arrived off the Isle of Wight on an afternoon so clear and pleasant as to resembla almost a summer day. However, about four o'clock the sun became obscured and the sky of a dull leaden colours, and a species of mist seemed to envelope the horizon. At the same it time began to snow, and the snow was accompanied with a biting wind of such strength (we had almost said ferosity) that people who a few minute* before had been walking and chatting gaily on the Southsea Common, were bent double by its force, whilst on the Portsdown Hill the dust was lifted and whirled towards the sky in masses resembling water-spouts. Into this storm of haze, and wind and snow, sailed the Eurydice, with every sail set, save and except her mizen-royal, and braced sharp on the port tack. She was seen no more !! A schooner, named the Emma, bound from Newcastle-on-Tyne to Poole, was also caught in the squall, but she weathered it successfully, and almost immediately the sun, we are told, came out again. The master of the schooner, on looking round, states that he saw wreckage, and thought that he heard cries, but there was no sign of the noble ship, which but a moment before had pursued her way proudly with all her studding sails set. Five men were rescued by those on board the Emma, and they were stripped, wrapped in blankets, rubbed, and received every possible attention ; but we much regret to say that three of them died on board, the other two, an A.B. named Benjamin Cuddiford, and a first-class boy, named Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, were removed to the Cottage Hospital Bonchurch, where they received every attention, and are considered by Dr. Williamson, of Veutnor, to be progressing favourably. The following is the account given Benjamin Cuddiford:

"The ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm about four o clock, when we were five miles from Dunnose.

"There were over 300 men on board, all of whom, except myself, and Fletcher, are, I believe, lost.

"I was one of the last on board the ship. Captain Hare was near me when she went down after capsizing, and she carried with her a large number of men who were clinging to her, who were drawn down in the vortex.

"A man near me said that a vessel was close by when the squall came on, and therefore we should be sure to be picked up. I was more than hour the water, being a first-rate swimmer, and very many of my comrades cried out for help. I tried to assist two or three, but at last there were four clinging me, and I was obliged to kick them off. We were well taken care of by the master the schooner and crew. Our ship left Bermuda three week's ago passed the Lizard yesterday, and expected to anchor at about five o'clock."

SCENE AT THE DOCKYARD GATES.

The scene at the dockyard gates this morning was harrowing in the extreme. The gates this time of the year are opened at seven o'clock, but long before that hour crowds of anxious relatives had assembled in the faint hope that the awful news which had spread through the town during the night might prove after all to be, if not unfounded, at any rate exaggerated ; but tnere was no such comfort for the poor bereaved ones. The officials at the entrance broke the news to them as gently they could, but the scene was one that would have made an impression even on the callous-hearted. Mothers waiting for their sons, bonnie boys just bursting into manhood, and wives who had reason to believe that their husbands were among the time-expired men several of whom it was known had taken passage home by the Eurydice, mourning, only those who are suddenly widowed, can.

RETURN GOVERNMENT TUG "MANLY" TO THE DOCKYARD.

So soon was the accident was reported to the Admiral steamers were sent to the locality; but up to four o'clock, when the tug Manly returned, no bodies had been recovered. A party of riggers who went out in the tug have commenced work, but the divers have not yet gone down.

[Press Association Telegram.]

Our Ventnor correspondent telegraphs that the weather was beautifully fine yesterday afternoon, and every rope of the Eurydice could be distinguished about a mile off. With alarming suddenness a gale set in from the north-west, and surprise was expressed by old salts that the Eurydice did not shorten sail, she having even her standing-sails set. The thick weather concealed her when passing Dunnose Head, and when the weather cleared she was not to be seen. The schooner Emma, of Newcastle, was observed to be lowering boats, only five, however, were rescued. Medical aid was obtained from shore, but three of them were so exhausted that they died shortly afterwards. Two— Cuddiford and Fletcher,— were removed to the College Hospital and soon recovered. Fletcher states that he was below with the greater part of the crew, when, hearing a noise, he rushed up the hatchway and heard the cry, "All hands for themselves." He caught life buoy, and jumped overboard, as did the others who were picked up. A minute afterwards the ship gave a lurch forward and sank drawing him down a considerable distance, but the life buoy raised him again. The vessel now lies two miles off Luccombe chine. Several gunboats are cruising round the spot, and attempts will be made to raise her. There is some hope that the barque seen near the spot may saved others.

NAMES OF THE PASSENGERS.

We have received a telegram from the Admiralty informing us that the names of the passengers are not known, but that we shall be informed of their ratings, and these, together with later particulars, we hope publish in our subsequent editions.

The following account was received by one of our reporters from an official connected with one of the tugs, which returned from the wreck in the early morning :—

Her Majesty's training-ship Eurydice, commanded by Captain Marcus Hare, capsized about half-past four yesterday afternoon off Dunnose, Isle of Wight. She left Bermuda on the afternoon of the 6th inst. with between three hundred and three hundred and sixty men on board, and was expected here in few days. At four o'clock yesterday afternoon, she was seen by the schooner Emma standing the eastward under all plain sail and courses. She was then braced sharp up on the port tack. A snow storm with heavy squalls then came on, and she lost sight her. At a quarter to five, on the weather clearing a little, the Eurydice was nowhere to be seen. A punt, with five men in it, was perceived, and the schooner immediately bore down upon them and took them on board. Three of them, including the First Lieutenant (Francis H. Tabor), have since died. The other two, named Benjamin Cuddiford, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, have recovered, and are now being well taken care of the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch. Cuddiford states that the ship was caught in a squall and capsized about five miles off Dunnose about four o'clock. He was standing close to Captain Hare when the ship went down, sucking many with it. He was about an hour in the water, and tried to save others who clung to him but in order to save himself he was at last obliged to kick them off. The sad news was immediately telegraphed to Admiral Fanshawe, commander-in-chief, who at once sent steamers to search the vicinity, but they found no trace of any other survivors, and it is feared that all hands, with the exception of Cuddiford and Fletcher, are lost. The ship is lying in about twelve fathoms of water, and at low tide her lower yards are above water. The foretop-gallant mast, and the main royal mast are both gone. The mizen royal is the only sail furled. A party of fifty riggers and several divers proceeded to the spot this morning. The Dromedary is to lay by the wreck ait light ship.

In reference to this sad catastrophe the following was received at the Admiralty last night:–

"J. G. Livesey, Ventnor, the Right Hon. W. H. Smith, M.P., Admiralty, London"

"Her Majesty's training-ship Eurydice capsized in a sudden squall, off Dunnose, at half-past four this afternoon, and went down at once.

"The Emma (schooner), passing, picked up five men, but some have since died.

"Cuddicome (?) first-class boy, and Fletcher saved. Tabor, First Lieutenant, very doubtful. Military Engineer officer drowned.

"Ship was commissioned at Portsmouth Feb. 7, 1877, and ordered to the West Indies. Was now bound for Spithead. Was observed passing Ventnor a few minutes before the catastrophe with all sails set. Snowstorm then came on very suddenly, with ery heavy gusts of wind. Probably no more saved than schooner picked up, as a strong ebb tide was running.

"Sun came out brilliantly directly after squall, but nothing could be seen from shore at Ventnor but few large boxes brought down Channel. Certainly no boat.

"Schooner detained by Capt. Roche, R.N., Inspecting Commander St. Catherine Division Coast Guard, who went on board immediately with Ventnor doctor, and has telegraphed to Admiral at Portsmouth to send steamer round,

"Admiral Fanshawe to Admiralty.

"Have just received the following from Coast Guard, Ventnor : 'Eurydice capsized off Dunnose. Cuddicombe, first-class boy, and Fletcher saved; Tabor, first lieutenant, very doubtful, military engineer officer drowned.' "

"Commander Coast Guard, Ventnor, to Admiralty,

"We have two men alive— Cuddiford, A.8., and Fletcher, first-class boy— and the dead bodies of Lieuteuant Tabor, Colonel Ferrier, R.E., and one able seaman."

The Eurydice was a wooden training ship for ordinary seamen and boys, a vessel of 921 tons. She is thus described in the Navy List :

Eurydice, guns, sixth rate.  
Captain—Marcus A. S. Hare, Feb. 7, 1877.  
Lieutenants—Francis H. Tabor, Feb. 7, 1877; Charles V, Strange, Oct. 10, 1877 ; Wm. E. Black, Feb. 7, 1877 ; Stanley A. B..Burney, Feb. 7, 1877.  Staff-Surgeon—James L. Whitney, Feb. 2, 1877.

THE LOSS OF H.M.S. "EURYDICE."

Mr. Goschen asked if the First Lord the Admiralty had any further information in reference to the sad disaster—the loss of the Eurydice– which had spread through the country such deep and universal sorrow. (Hear, hear.)

Mr. Smith was sorry he had not much information beyond what had already appeared in the Press. The disaster was a most mournful one, for the ship was returning after a successful and useful cruise, and the squall by which she was overtaken was so sudden and violent that she went down without notice. Admiral Fanshawe, in a late telegram, reported that everything bad drifted towards the French coast, and no bodies had been recovered. It appeared that when the disaster occurred the men were in the act of shortening sail. The two men recovered were in Bonchurch Cottage Hospital, and it was hoped they would be well enough to be in London, to-morrow. The officers on board the Eurydice were specially selected for efficiency. He expressed the deep sorrow the Admiralty felt at the disaster— the greatest since the loss of the Captain. (Hear, hear.)

FOUNDERING OF H.M.& EURYDICE.

We have received the following sad news from the Admiralty:– "The Admiralty have received the following telegram from Admiral Fanshawe, Commander-In-Chief Portsmouth: — 'Have just received the following from Coastguard, Ventnor:— 'Eurydice capsized off Dunnose. Cuddicome, First-class Boy, and Fletcher saved. Tabor, First Lieutenant, very doubtful. Steamer going Immediately'

"A further telegram states that she capsized in a sudden squall at half-past 4 this (Sunday) afternoon. A subsequent telegram states that Lieutenant Tabor and Colonel Ferrler, Royal Engineers, are dead. The Eurydice was commissioned by Captain Hare, in February, 1877, as a training-ship for second-class Ordinary Seamen, and she was returning to Spithead after a winter’s cruise in the West Indies. The Admiral Commanding-in-Chief at Portsmouth has sent steamers to search the vicinity of the accident, but no further report has been received.  
Admiralty, Sunday, 11 30 p.m.”

VENTNOR, Sunday Evening.  
Her Majesty’s training-ship Eurydice capsized in a sudden squall off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, at half-post 4 o’clock this afternoon, and went down at once. The schooner Emma, which was passing, picked up five men. but some of these have since died. Cuddicombe, a First-class Boy, and Fletcher were saved, and Tabor, the First Lieutenant, but it is very doubtful whether he will recover. The military Engineer officer was drowned. The ship was commissioned at Portsmouth on the of February, 1877, and was ordered to the West Indies. She was now bound for Spithead, and was observed passing Ventnor few minutes before the catastrophe with all sail set. A snowstorm then came on very suddenly with very heavy gusts of wind. Probably no more men have been saved than those picked up by the schooner, as a strong ebb tide was running. The sun came out brilliantly directly after the squall, but nothing could be seen from the shore Ventnor except a few large boxes being swept down the Channel, and certainly no boats. The schooner has been detained by Captain Roche, R.N., Inspecting Commander, St. Catherine's Division of the Coastguard, who went on board immediately with Ventnor doctors, and has telegraphed to the Admiral at Portsmouth to send round a steamer.

Later.  
Lieutenant Tabor is dead, and his body has been brought ashore, so that the only survivors, so far as known, are Benjamin Cuddicombe, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, First-class Boy, aged 19. Cuddicombe states that the ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm five miles of Dunnose, about 4 o’clock. More than 300 men were on board, all of whom, he believes, are lost except himself and Fletcher. Cuddicombe was among the last on the ship. Captain Hare was near him when the ship went down, suclkng many with it. Cuddicombe and man near him said that vessel was close by when the squall came on, and, therefore, they would be sure to picked up. He was over an hour the water. Being a first-rate swimmer, every one called out to him for help. He tried to assist two or three, but last four clung to him, and he was obliged to kick them off. Was well taken care of the Master of the schooner and Crew. The ship left Bermuda three weeks ago, passed the Lizard yesterday, and expected to anchor at Spithead about 5 o’clock.

These two men are well provided for at the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch, and are under the care of Dr. Williamson, of Ventnor, who considers them to be doing fairly well.

The Eurydice was a training-ship for Ordinary Seamen, and is officially described as sixth rate. She was under the command of Captain Marcus Hare. Having left Bermuda on her return trip as recently as the 6th inst., she was not expected to reach Portsmouth for some days. Her consorts, the Martin and the Liberty, have arrived—the former at Portsmouth, and the latter at Plymouth.

The following list of Officers board is given in the *Navy List* .—Captain Marcus A. S. Hare. Lieutenants : Francis H. Tabor, Charles Y. Strange, William E. Black, Stanley A. Burney. Staff-Surgeon; James L. Whitney. Paymaster: Frank Pittman. Sub-Lieutenants: the Hon. Edward B. Gifford, Herbert S. Edmonds, Walter S. Smith, Sidney G. Randolph.

THE GALE AND SNOW STORM

During the gale which passed over the metropolis so suddenly on Sunday afternoon, several boats were swamped in the upper part of the Thames and loss of life resulted.

The weather in South Shropshire is intensely cold, and the hilly district has been visited with fitful storms of snow. Thee tops of the lofty eminences of the Loag-mynd, the Carodoc Range, and the Clee Hills, are all capped with snow.

During a snowstorm which raged off the Scotch cosst at Stranraer on Sunday the schooner Ellipse, with coals, from Greenock for Isly, was totally lost about ten miles from Stranraer. Two of the crew, by name M'Millan and M'Neill, were drowned.

On Sunday afternoon, while the wind was blowng hard from the north, a schooner, which afterwards proved to be the Heroine, of Dartmouth, bound from Lydney to Fremington with a cargo of coals, was seen running for the harbour at Appledore, in Devon, when sha was caught by some dense snow squalls which completely enveloped her. On their clearing away she was found to have been driven on the South Tail Bank, where she was surrounded by broken water. The Appledore No. 1 life-boat of the National Life-boat Institution was launched with all despatch, and was fortunately enabled to save the crew of the vessel, which is likely to become a total wreck.

The screw-steamer Eagle, of Neath, while making for Hayle Harbour, in Cornwall, on Sunday, during a stroug N.E. wind, grounded on the bar, and the heavy seas breaking over her carried away her screw, rudder, and stern poet. The Oxford University life-boat Isis, belonging to the National Life-boat Institution, and stationed at this place, promptly proceeded to her and remained by her for an hour, until it was considered the lives of the crew were no longer in danger.

On Sunday morning, during a strong wind from the north, a vessel ran ashore on the Goodwin Sands. Tha Broadstairs life-boat of the National Life-boat Institution and the Ramsgate Harbour steamer Vulcan and life-boat Bradford proceeded to her assistance, and after some hours' exertion they were successful in getting the disabled vessel off the sands and into harbour. She was the brigantine Florida, of Christiania, bound from Frederikstadt to Granville, with a cargo of coal, and had on board a crew of seven men.

On Sunday evening, during a heavy gale from the north, accompanied by snow showers, the schooner Velocity, of Nefyn, bound there from Silloth, exhibited signals of distress in Porthdinllaen Bay, North Wales, and in response thereto the National life-boat George Moore was launched, and succeeded in rescuing ths crew, whom she landed in safety. This life-boat was placed there about six months since, its expense being defrayed from a fund raised amongst the *employés* of Messrs. Copt stake, Hughes, Crampton, and Co. (lat. Mtssrs. Copestake, Moore, and Co.), to provide a life-boat to be called the George Moore in memory of their late respected employer, the well-known philanthropist.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

From Our Own Correspondent, Ventnor, Monday

Finding that the two poor fellows who had such a narrow escape from the sinking of the ill-fated Government training-ship Eurydice were sufficiently convalescent to admit of an interview, I spent a short time with them in their bed-room this morning, and elicited a few facts from them concerning tha terrible catastrophe. These poor fellows, Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher, did not appear to be very communicative, but thay exhibited no particular studied desire to withhold any facts. Cuddiford, a powerful-looking man, about 35, was second captain on the quarterdeck, and belongs to Plymouth. Fletcher is a youth about 20 years of age, and was qualifying as seaman. From Cuddiford's statement, which was confirmed by Fletcher, it appears that the Eurydice left Bermuda on the 6th instant, having on board ber full complement o officers and men, with about 300 men and boys in training for her Majesty's navy. There were also Colonel Ferrier and five other officers of the Royal Engineers on board, with Colonel Ferrier's servant. They had a fine voyage homeward, with the exception of one day's rough sea. As they passed Bonchurch and Ventnor shortly after mid-day the vessel was in full sail, and there appeared not the slightest premonitory indication of the awful event. Part of the men and boys were below deck at the time, and some of them were asleep in their berths, having gone off duty at noon. At the moment of the catastrophe they were thrown bodily from their sleeping postures, and as they rushed to the gangways they were met by the sea and carried below with the ill-fated vessel. There were others firmly locked in the cells below deck, and several were in irons for various misdemeanours. There were six of these prisoners on board, being transferred to Portsmouth — four from her Majesty's ship Rover, which was in the company of the Eurydice on the West Indian station, one from the brig Martin, and one from the Bermuda dockyard. After passing Bonchurch the ship was sailing apparently in safety, when a sudden squall from the W.N.W. caught hold of her canvas, and, with the aid of an immense sea which broke upon the port side of the hull, she was quickly thrown on her beam ends. The captain was at his post, and instantly gave orders to take in the lower studding-sail, which Cuddiford, who was on deck at the time, seized hold of and let go, hastening afterwards to the side of the captain at the stern of the vessel. Other men had been ordered aloft, and were in the act of taking in the royals when the ship sank, carrying all hands with her. There were only four guns on board, bnt they were all fast, and did not seem to move from the port holes. She was what the seamen call a "stiff"' vessel, and the hands considered her safe, particularly in regard to the unlooked-for casualty of capsizing. When she heeled over a rush was made for the starboard boat, but they were unable to clear her from her davits and she was stove in ; but as to the boat to windward, that was lifted so high in the air aa to be out of all reach, and it was useless to attempt to utilise it. It had been a beautiful day, and the port doors had been unsuspectingly left open, and when the vessel heeled over the sea rushed into these open ports like a torrent, and the hands on deck plunged into the sea as the craft went down. The captain bravely remained on the deck till nearly every man who was on the upper deck had jumped overboard, and so far as the survivors could remember he went down with the ship. Suddenly thrown into the raging sea, the seamen struggled and cried for assistance, but there was none to help. Tha two men who were saved are good swimmers, aad they say they were in the water about an hour. They could see the cliffs as the snowstorm cleared away, and they struggled hard to reach the shore, but all their efforts proved ineffectual. They were on the verge of despair, when, to make bad worse, they saw to their horror an immense sea rushing towards them and threatening speedy destruction. In their last hope they turned upon the coming wave and in terror awaited their fate. As if by a miracle they found themselves again on the surface of the water. After this swell had spent itself, and again looking round, they discovered a short distance away a schooner which had weathered the terrible storm. By this time they were almost exhausted, but they took fresh courage from the sight of the schooner, which was bound for Poole, and raised their hands as a signal of distress. When hauled on board they became unconscious, but recovered before they were landed at Ventnor.

From other sources it seems that the schooner made signals to the shore, while on board they were doing all they could to restore the poor sea-men, having also picked up Colonel Ferrier, Lieutenant Tabor, and an able seaman who has not get been identified, but is supposed to be named Bennett. All were alive when picked up by the schooner— the Emma, of Poole— but the two officers and the unknown seaman had expired before they reached the shore at Ventnor, whither they were taken by a Deal lugger, which had been chartered by the coaatguards and taken off to the Emma by Chief-officer Clark, of the Ventnor station. Lieutenant Tabor was found clinging to a locker which had been washed from the foundered ship.

Cuddiford and Fletcher left Ventnor by the 2.10 train this afternoon for Portsmouth, there to undergo an examination by the Admiral of the Port. The Eurydice is now lying, it is thought, on a ledge, drifted there by the rough sea. She stands with a slight list, but at low water several feet of her upper masts are observable with the topsails furled. During the day two Government tugs have been at the scene of the wreck.

FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT. PORTSMOUTH. MONDAY.

There is as yet very little to add to the sad account of the loss of life in the Eurydice. The two sailors, Cuddiford and Fletcher, who are as yet known to be the only survivors, have been brought to the dockyard and have been seen by the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Fanshawe, and other officials. Two sets of divers were sent out this morning to the wreck, but up to 7 p.m. there is no information of any bodies having been found, although as in all such cases there are various reports and opinions expressed.

The master of the schooner Emma, who picked up the survivors, states that he was proceeding down Channel, and being below in his berth he was hurriedly called on deck by the mate in charge and told there were signs of a heavy gale coming on. On reaching the deck he immediately gave orders to guard against the evidently impending danger by taking in all the sail he had set. The mate then told the master that a short time previous he saw a man of war ahead, but new she was nowhere to be seen, and on nearing the spot where she was last seen he saw the men he had picked up floating about, but did not see any other bodies. He states that the gale and snowstorm was the most violent he ever witnessased, as it came to its height almost suddennly.

The schoomer and her crew have been detained by order of the Commander-in-Chief, in case the eNvdence of the men should be required at any court of inquiry that may hereafter be hold. The sad calamity has caused a heavy gloom to spread over the place and neighbourhood, where so many of the relatives of the unfortunate officers and crew reside.

Her Majesty sent a telegram to-day to the Commander-in-Chief for all particulars, and to express her grief at the sad occurrence.

PORTSMOUTH, MONDAY EVENING

A steamer has just come in from the scene of the wreck, but no bodies have been found. Divers have been down, but they could not penetrate to the lower deck. All the sails are set. Thy wreck is not more than a mile and a half from the shore.

TELEGRAMS FROM THE QUEEN.

The following telegrem has bean received at Portsea from General Ponsonby at Windsor:-

"The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further particulars."

In accordance with the Royal request all available intelligence was transmitted to the Queen.

The following telegram from the Queen to the First Lord of the Admiralty. dated Windsor, 4.5 p.m., was received at the Admiralty is the early part of last evening:—

"The Queen would ask Mr. Smith to intake known her grief at the terrible calamity of the Eurydice, and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted parents and relatives."

The subjoined particulars of the deplorable event are gleaned from various sources :—

Captain Somerset, the senior officer at Bermuda, in a letter of the 6th inst., reports that the Eurydice arrived on 25th February from Antigua, and sailed 6th March for Portsmouth. She had on board, besides her own otficera and crew, one ship's corporal, nine marines and time-expired men, six military time-expired men, two naval invalids, and three court-martial prisoners. The names of these men are not yet known.

Captain Hare, who commanded the Eurydice, and Lieutenant Tabor, the first lieutenant, were first-rate seamen and were selected by the late Mr. Ward Hunt especially for their good qualities in this respect. The cruise had been a most successful one.

When the Eurydice, on February 14, parted company with the training-brigs Martin and Liberty, which arrived home last Thursday, the Eurydice was proceeding to Antigua to refit. During the voyage, several ordinary seamen were promoted by Captain Hare to the rank. of A.B.'s.

A telegram from Ventnor on Monday morning says:— "The sudden capsizing of her Majesty's ship Eurydice yesterday afternoon, and the lose of some 313 lives, has cast a gloom over our little town, and this morning broke without revealing any speck on the wide expanses of water giving hope of further lives saved. The only two known surivors— Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher—are progressing favourably, and are quite as will as could be expected after such a prolonged immersion on such a wintry day. The masts of the ill-fated frigate are now visible about two miles from shore, off Lucombe. As there was a strong ebb tide at the time of the disaster and a strong north wind blowing no bodies are likely to wash ashore here. The Eurydice passed Ventnor at 3.15 with a heavy press of sail, and this attracted considtrable attention and admiration. Within half an hour from that time the weather, which bad been bright, suddenly changed, and a strong gust having caught the sails caused her at once to capsize and sink. But for the schooner Emma passing at the time nothing would have been known of the disaster, as for fully half an hour every object was obscurod by a blinding snowstorm, and it would have been thought that the ship had gone on safely to Spithead."

At Portsmouth yesterday morning, on the loss of the Eurydice becoming known, a large number of relatives and friends of the men on board flocked to the dockyard to obtain information. Nothing, however, was made known beyond the bare announcement of the disaster posted on the dockyard gates. One of the tugs which started for the scene of the casualty on Sunday night returned yesterday and took out a large party of shipwrights and riggers and the diving apparatus. The crew of the tug report that at low water her lower yards are just visible above water. She appears to have been in full sail when caught in the squall, and the only sail failed, as far as can at present be ascertained, was the main royal. According to competent opinion ths Eurydice was backed sharp upon the port tack when seized by the squall. The foretopgallant mast and the main royal are broken off, andthis may be taken as indicative of the strength and severity of the squall.

A correspondent, telegraphing from Ventnor yesterday morning, says— "It was a sudden squall from land which upset the Eurydice whilst taking in sail. She immediately heeled over on her beam. All the boats were swept away. She was going at the rate of 15 miles an hour. Some men jumped overboard, but nearly all stuck to the ship, and the captain remained till the last. The ship rapidly filled with water, and in a few minutes went down head foremost. Cuddiford thinks that many were killed instantaneously at the time the sheip heeled over. He jumped overboard himself just before the ship went down. Looking around him he could only see about 30 come to the surface, amongst them being the two doctors, who were both swimming. The first lieutenant, Mr. Tabor, and a captain of the Royal Engineers had seized hold of a wash-deck locker. For some time after Cuddiford had taken hold of the buoy he could not see land. He estimates the time they were in the water at about one hour and 20 minutes. Fletcher, the other survivor, hailed him and they were making for the shore when they were picked op by the schooner Emma, whose atention they attracted by raising their hands and shouting out. There were 30 passengers on board, seven members of the ROyal Engineers, six prisoners, one in irons, the others in cells. Fletcher was saved by fortunately picking up a cork life-belt from the ship's life-boat. Benjamin Cuddiford is an able seaman and Sidney Hatcher an ordinary seaman. Fletcher was on the watch below decks. When he found the ship heeling over he rushed on deck, and found the ship's gunwale under water. A violent squall and snowstorm prevailed at the time of the wreck. 1Lieutenant Tabor was picked up alive, but died on the schooner Emma. The captain of Engineers was picked up dead. This narrative is obtained from the survivors this morning."

A telegram from Portsmouth at noon yesterday says: —"The excitement here is intense, and many unfounded rumours are circulatiog. One statement has been spread to the effect that the captain and two midshipmen of the Eurydice had been picked up alive, but no such tidings have been received at the Admiralty offices, and the report is therefere discredited. The admiral and the captain of the Steam Reserve have gone to the wreck, and a despatch-boat has just been sent from the flag-ship with provisions for the working party at the wreck. By all nautical men the Eurydice was looked upon as one of the finest sailing frigates in the service, and the feeling among them is one of universal surprise at such a catastrophe having overtaken her. She was at one time commanded by Admiral Sir George Elliot, who was remarkably well pleased with her. The relatives of the officers and crew continue to  present themselves in large numbers at the Admiralty offices here seeking for Information. In some cases a wife or a mother has been sent to the scene of the disater, so as to be near at hand in case of any others being rescued alive or their remains recovered. Hopes are still entertained that some of the crew may yet be heard of as having been washed ashore elsewhere or picked up in the Channel. The severity of the weather on Sunday, however, renders this theory extremely improbable. The Government steamers continue to cruise round in hopes of gaining some tidings. The inquest on the remains of the four men picked up has not yet been fixed."

The indications are that her sails were not blown away by the squall, and the consequently she was laid on her beam-ends, and it is surmised that the ports being open she immediately filled and sank. The Eurydice being a fine statch ship, it is believed there wil be no difficulty in raising her. She was a fully rigged ship. She was a wooden ship of 921 tons. She is ths described in the Navy List:-

CAPSIZING oF H.M.S. "EURYDICE"  
OVER 300 LIVES LOST.

On Sunday afrernoon, one of the most sudden and terrific snow squalls whica we ever remember at tnis time of the year, passed over Ryde, making tne waters in the Solent rise in white-capped breakers in a wonderfully short space of time and those who witnessed its effects on the waters think of the "poor souls at sea." Although accidents were anticipated, the imagination of no one compassed such a terrible event as that which then occurred at the back of the Wight. In the course of the evening it was whispered, with bated breath, that one of Her Majesty's ships had been overset off Ventnor, and the dreadful rumour was, of course, treated at first as a canard. Its correctness was, however, subsequentiy verifed, and the excitement which reigned may be easily imagined, more especially on the following morning, when the news of the sad disaster was spread abroad far and wide. At Ventnor, however, the excitement was most intense. On Sunday afternoon the weather wss comparatively fine and miid, and there were more than tne usual number of visitors on the esplanade. About 4 o'clock all eyes were turned to a pleasant sight. Close to the shore, and easily distinguished, was H.M.S. Eurydice, which was bowling along uuder a press of canvas, with a stiff breeze, at a fine rate. Soon, however, the sky be- came overcast, and it became evident that a storm wa-s coming on, and the vessel was watched by the "old salts" with some interest. As they noted tne storm gathering, their verdict was "that fellow will soon have to shorten sail." The snow storm which came on, however, soon drove the promenaders to their homes, and hid the ship from all, and she was not seen again. The sudden squall caught her off Dunnose, and she Was overturned in a moment, and went down with over 300 men. Only five of these were picked up. The schooner Emma, which was passing, picked up five men — Lieutenant Tabor, Captain Ferrier, R.E., Bennett, Cuddiford, and Fletcher, a first-class boy, but the first three of these died before reaching the shore. The ship was commissioned at Portsmouth on the 7th of February, 1877, and was ordered to the West Indies. She was now bound for Spithead. Cuddiford states that the ship capsized in a squall and snow storm, five mils off Dunnose, about 4 o' clock. More than 3OO men were on board, all of whom, he believes, are lost, excepting himself and Fletcher. Cuddiford was amongst the iast on the ship. Captain Hare was with him when the ship went down, sucking many with it. Cuddiford and a man near him said that a vessel was close by when the squall came on, and, therefore, they would be sure to be picked up. He was over an hour in the water, and, being a good swimmer, every one called out to him for help. He tried to assist two or three, but at last four clung to him, and he was obdged to kick tnem off. He was well taken care of by tne master and crew of the schooner. The ship left Bermuda three weeks ago, passed the Lizaid on Sunday, and was expected to anchor at Spithead about, 5 o'clock.

The following list of officers on board is given in the *Navy List*: Captain, Marcus A. S. Hare; Lieuteuants, Francis H. Tabor. Charles Y. Strange, William E. Black, Stanley A Burney; Staff-surgeon, James L. Whitney; Paymaster, Frank Pittman; Sub-Lieutenants, the Hon. Edward R. Gifford, Herbert S. Edmonds, Walter S. Smith, Sidney G. Randolph ; Surgeon, Robert Murdoch, M. B. ; gunner, Frederick Aden ; boatswains, William Brewer, Joseph Warren ; assistant clerk, William Lamont.

FURTHER PARTICULARS

The Eurydice was a wooden sailing, fully-rigged ship of 921 tons displacement, and was at one time considered one of tne smartest and quickest 26 gun frigates in the service. She was built about 1843. Last year she was conveted into a training-ship for orainary seamen at Mr John White's yard at Cowes, and was completed for sea at Portsmouth dockyard. She was commissioned on the 7th of February, 1877, and finally sailed from Portsmouth on the 13th of November with a crew of about 390 ordinary seamen and the officers named above. All the officers and crew are lost, with the exception of two seamen. Captain Hare had been at one time commander of the St. Vincent, training-ship at Portsmouth, and was selected for the command from his knowledge and experience of young seamen. Lieutenant Tabor was a thorougnly efficient sailor, having had command of ihe Cruizer in ihe Mediterranean. The Eurydice Was aocompnied foom Portsmouth by the training- brig Martin, and was eventually joined at Madeira by the Liberty from Plymouth. All the vessels were filled with ordinary seamen, whom it was considered necessary to inure to the sea by a long cruise ; and, as they were all draughted from the home training-snips, the distress caused by their loss is spread over the whole country. They were, of course, mostly unmarried men, and in this respect the crew differ irom that of the Captain, who were principally able-bodied seamen and petty officers. Tne Liberty arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago, the Eurydice being detained for the purpose of taking up supernumeraries. Captain Hare, however, intormed Lieutenant Commander Hicks that he expected to be home almost as soon as the Martin.

THE VOYAGE FROM BERMUDA.

The Eurydice left Bermuda on ihe 6th inst., and nothing was heard uf her until she was seen by the Coastguard at Bonchurch at 3.30 on Sunday afternoon, bearing for Spithead under all piain sail, and with her port stunsails set on the foretopmast and maintopmast, the object being clearly to arrive at the anchorage at Spithead before nightfall. There was an ominous stillness prevailing at this time. A heavy bank of clouds was coming down from the north-west, and the glass was falling rapidly. Such wind as there was from the westward, and blew on the port quarter of the ship. The Isle of Wight is of peculiar formation on its southern fringe, having what may be considered as a double coast-line, extending from Blackgang Chine as far as Shanklin. The inner circle of the Downs reaches a height of 500 feet above the sea, and affords a deceptive shelter to ships well inshore. From the direction in which the Eurydice was steering she would be in comparatively smooth water, so sheltered would she be by the Downs, until she rounded Dunnose Point, where the disaster occurred. This circumstance will also serve to explain the fact that the schooner Emma, which was near at the time, was not affected by the gale. At 10 minutes to 4 the wind suddenly veered round from the west to the eastward, and a gale, accompanied by a blinding fall of snow, came rushing from the high lands down Luccombe Chine, sinking the Eurydice just a little before the beam, driving her out of her course, which was heading to the north-east, and turning her bows to the east. This is what seems probable, thougn, from the manner in which the sea was concealed by the snow, nothing was seen of her at the supreme moment when she capsized to starboard. The air cleared as suddenly as it became overcast, the wind sinking away at the same time. As soon as anything could be seen, the masts and top-hamper ot the snip were discerned above the water about 2 3/4 miles E.N.E. off Dunnose - a well-known and lofty landmark between Shanklin and Ventnor. The ship lies in 11 fathoms of water, and from her position she appears to have righted in going down.

RESCUE OF THE SURVIVORS.

Capt. Langworthy Jenkin, master of the Emma, schooner, bound from Newcastle for Poole with coals, was the means of rescuing the survivors, and has brought his ship into Portstmouth to give particulars. He states that at 45 minutes past 4 on Sunday afteruoon, after a heavy squall, the atmosphere cleared, and he observed sume wreckage and the royais of a ship flappiug above the water. He also fancied he heard some one shouting for assistance. He sent a man into the rigging to look out, who reported that he saw a man floating ln the water with a cork jacket. He immediately made sail and stood towards him. Having to tack once to fetch him, he hoisted out boats, which picked up four mem, and one man was picked up from the ship. He did his best to restore their circulation, but one of the men had died before he was got on board. Capt. Jenkins then stood for Ventnor with colours half-mast high, and a boat came off. A doctor was sent for, but two other men died before he arrived. The Coastguard boat afterwards came alongside with Commander Roach, who recognised the body of Lieut. Tabor, the first lieutenant of the Eurydice, and the other as an officer of the Royal Engineers. When the men were picked up, Dunnose bore N.W. by W. three to four miles.

TELEGRAMS FROM THE QUEEN.

During Monday the Commander-in-Chief was in constant communication with Her Majesty and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and in the course of the day received the following telegrams from the Queen. The first, which came from Her Majesty, was in the following terms: 

"The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further details."

The second was transmitted to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and was to the following effect :

"The Queen would ask Mr Smith to make kunwn her grief at the terrible calamity to the Eurydice and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted friends and relatives."

In another telegram to Mr Smith the Queen said the telegrams had caused us the greatest grief. These telegrams, having been forwarded to Admiral Fanshawe, were promptly posted at the dockyard gates, where they were eagerly read by sympathetic crowds.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

[EXCERPTED - FUNDRAISING]

Although the Coroner's jury has agreed in finding a verdict exonerating the captain, officers, and crew of the Eurydice from any culpability as regards the loss of the ship, it has been noticed that they expressly do so from the evidence that was adduced before them, and as this consisted necessarily of the statements of the able seaman Cuddiford, and the ordinary seamen Fletcher, a mere lad, who was below at the time the ship was struck, it is thought that further investigation into the circumstances of the wreck is called for. A Naval Court of Inquiry will be held on board the Duke of Wellington, at Portsmouth, under the presidency of Admiral Fanshawe and Admiral Hall. The Secretary of the Admiralty has already visited the port for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements. The great difficulty is to account for Captain Hare crowding his vessel with canvas at a time when the falling of the barometer showed that bad weather was at hand, and after other ships had shortened sail. There has been no rumours of panic, but it is thought that the efforts of the officers at the supreme moment of being struck may have been partly arrested by the fact that the ship was manned by ordinary seamen who were comparatively inexperienced. It is also regarded as unusual that a ship with all ger canvas spread and cutting through the water at about nine knots should have had her lee ports open. Had the ports been closed, or had they been closed as soon as the squall was noticed, it is thought that the ship would have righted herself after being struck, even had there been no time to lower the balliards and shorten sail. The body of Lieutenant Tabor, the IFrst Lietenant, was conveyed to the relatives of the deceased at Cheam by the last train on Tuesday night, and yesterday the body of Captain Ferrier was removed to Edinburgh for interment, the men-of-war in harbour lowering their ensigns sa it was brought on shore. It is known that no bodies are on the weather deck, and it is not believed that many of the bodies of the port watch will be recovered as they would most probably be carried out to sea with the ebb tide, assisted by the wind. It is, however, thought that the starboard watch will all be found between decks. One hundred and twenty coffins have been ordered to be forwarded to Haslar Hospital in readiness for the reception of the bodies. 

The riggers and divers went out again on Wednesday, to the wreck, but the weather was too boisterous to enable them to get near. The weather having moderated, they went out again in the afternoon, and succeeded in getting of the fore royal and letting go her fore tack and sheet. They very nearly succeeded in clearing the foresail, but as the tide was coming up strong, they were obliged to desist for the night. Only the fore, main and mizen yards remain and when these, the slack rops, and the anchor gear have been cleared, the ship will be ready for slinging. Until the yards are removed itis dangerous for the divers to go between decks, and it is doubtful whether the bodies will be reached until the ship is afloat.

Nothing further has occurred with reference to the Eurydice. The tugs went out of Portsmouth harbour yesterday meorning to continue operations on the wreck, but when they reached Southsea pier they encountered so heavy a sea that it was deemed useless to proceed further, and they returned to harbour. The Pearl, corvette and the Rinaldo, sloop, which latter was formerly prepared to lift the Oberon off the shoal at the mouth of Portsmouth harbour, are being fitted to assist in lifting the Eurydice and floating her in Sandown bay. A number of purchases will be required, and a couple of weeks will probably elapse before operations will be commenced. A light ship has been moored near the wreck.

Orders have been given by the Admiralty for the widows of the petty officers and seamen to be paid a sum of money equaly to one year's pay of their deceased husbands. This is the customary dole.

The Lord Mayor has intimated to the naval authorities at Portsmouth his willingness to receive subscriptions at the Mission House in aid of the fund now being raised for the relief of the widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of the men lost.

Lieutenant-General Price Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Tesk, and Admiral Sir Spencer Robinson, K.C.B. have joined the Eurydice Fund Ciommittee, of which Lord Henry Lennox is hon. secretary.

"Visitor" writes to us from Mitcham:

"On Sunday last I was walking with my son from Epsom Downs to Dorking via Headley Common, one of the most exposed pieces of table land in Surrey. About a quarter past 4 we observed an enormous black cloud like a monster balloon. It seemed to burst in a moment and for two minutes at least here was a regular tornado, which very nearly knocked us down. THe sno which followed lasted about three quarters of an hour, and on reaching a roadside inn we found that what appeared to be snow on our clothes was hard-frozen ice."

TO THE EDITOR

Sir, in the accounts which have appeared of the loss of the Eurydice and in the articles of which this sad catastrophe has furnished the text, I have seen no remark made on the conincidence that a somewhat similar fate, under somewhat similar circumstances,— for it was almost within sight of her destination — befell her ill-fated consort ship 15 years ago. COnsort ship I say, for the ship alluded to is the Orpheus. The loss of the Orpheus, as it happened on the other side of the world, has perhaps been forgotten here. Her Majesty's ship Orpheus, carrying the pendant of the Commodore of the Australia station, was entering the Manukau harbout, near Auckland, on her voyage to New Zealand. It was a fine Saturday afternoon in February or March, 1863. Mistaking the channel she struck on the bar; Commodore, officers and men took the the rigging, but were swept awy by the surf, the paymaster, two mid-dhipmen, and some 40 men being the only ones saved out of a large ship's company. I am speaking from memory only, but I saw the survivors brought on shore, and this, I think, was the number. The conincidence that two ships so connected by their names should be lost when their wished for havens were all but reached seems worthy of remark.  
I am your obedient servant,  
H. Stratton Bates.  
The Cranhams, Cirencester, March 25.  



TH: letter noteable eg for Eurydice myth, but also is:

> "The appalling accident to Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, whereby numerous families are rendered comparatively destitute through loss of the bread-winner, calls for the sympathy of all who hold that England should ever maintain her supremacy on the ocean, and this meeting pledges itself to use every endeavour to alleviate, as far as possible, the grievous loss sustained by the widows, orphans and relatives of those who, within sight of their homes, perished in the execution of their duty to their country."

Weather Chart for the week  MARCH 21ST TO MARCH 27TH (INCLUSIVE)

EXPLANATION. -The thick line shows the variations in the height of the Barometer during the past week ending Wednesday midnight. The fine line shows the shade temperature for the same interval, and gives the maximum and minimum readings for each day, with the (approximate) time at which they occurred. The information is furnished to us by the Meteorological Office.

REMARKS.

This week has been marked by a very sudden change from the mild dry weather recently reported to a period of very cold northerly and north-westerly winds, frost, and snow. The change commenced in Scotland on Thursday, the 21st instant, when strong northerly winds set in, bringing with them a sudden decrease of temperature, and considerable fall of snow. This spread rapidly, and by the following morning cold weather was felt all over the country, forming a marked contrast to the weather of the previous day. On Friday, the 22nd instant, the thermometer went down to 19° in the shade at York, 21° was registered at Cambridge, and in London, where the thermometer did not sink below 25° in the shade at any time during the week, that on the grass went as low as 12° on Sunday sight. During Sunday a most sudden shift of wind from west to north-west in a severs squall, with snow, took place over England. At Ledale, in Yorkshire, it took place at 10.20 a-m., in London at 3.50 p.m., and soon after in the Channel. The fall of temperature in the squall was very rapid. (See curve above.) In London a decrease of over 10° in nine minutes was observed, and a total fall of 18° in a little over an hour. The currents of air at the same time were *very* complicated. The barometer was highest (30'42 inches) on Thursday, the 2Sst instant lowest (29-48 inches) on Sunday, the 24th instant; range, 0'94 inches. Temperature, in the shade, was highest (56°) on Thursday, the 21st instant ; lowest (25°) on Tuesday, the 26th instant a range, 31'. Rainfall (entirely melted snow: Total fall, 0'03 inches, on two days; greatest fall, 0'02 inches, on Monday, the 25th instant.

CAPSIZING OF THE EURYDICE. LIVES LOST

We regret to have to record that during the sudden and severe snowstorm which occurred Sunday afternoon her Majesty's ship Eurydice, Admiralty training ship for second-class seamen, capsized off Dunnose, a headland near the the south east coast of the Isle of Wight. A schooner picked up five of the crew, but three of then died subsequently, one of them being Tabor, the first lieutenant, who was brought ashore at Ventnor. The only survivors are Benjamin Cuddiford, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, first-class boy, aged 19. These two men are well provided for at the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch. The Eurydice was commissioned in Portsmouth 1877, and sent to the Barbados station.

Ventnor, Monday Night.

There is now no doubt that during the sudden squall which passed over the British Isles on Sunday afternoon one of the most terrible disasters that has ever befallen the English navy occurred off the Isle of Wight, resulting in the almost immediate foundering of a well-found man-of-war, and the drowning of 328 souls of 330 who were on board her. The Eurydice, though an old fashioned wooden frigate, has gone to the bottom precisely the same way as the newly designed turret ship Captain did, that is:– She has been capsized owing to the press of canvas she was carrying, when suddenly struck by a squall, and sad to relate, the number who have perished with her is not far short of the total lost off the coast of Spain in Sept., 187O. The Eurydice was an old 26-gun sailing frigate, and in her day was regarded as a crack vessel. She had been laying up at Portsmouth for years until 1876 the Admiralty, at the suggestion of the late Mr, Ward Hunt, determined to utilise her as a seagoing training ship for ordinary seamen. This course, gave very general satisfaction to the service, it being felt that some more extended knowledge of working a big ship at sea was needed for our young sailors than they could possibly obtain by cruising about the Channel in the summer in the five, brigs hitherto employed for that purpose. Accordingly in February, 1877, the Eurydice was commissioned Portsmouth by Captain Marcus A. S. Hare, having a complement of 280 hands, by far the larger proportion being ordinary seamen of the second-class. For this she cruised about the Channel. Captain Hare fulfilling his special duty of instruction in the most satisfactory manner, and justifying his selection for such command by his special knowledge of sailing a ship. This was especially illustrated last summer, when he brought his vessel under sail from Plymouth Sound right into the Hamoaze, a feat which to that time had not been attempted for many years. At the commencement of the last winter, the Admiralty ordered the Eurydice to proceed on a winter cruise to the West Indies, and she did so, being accompanied by two brigs, also manned by ordinary seamen. She was returning from that cruise on Sunday, and was within an hour's sail of Spithead, when the terrible catastrophe chronicled below befel her. The Eurydice left Bermuda on the 6th inst., having on board, in addition to her own crew, some time-expired men both from the army and navy, and some prisoners, bringing the total number on board to 330. She had a very fair passage all the way home, passing the Lizard on Sunday morning, and being off the Isle of Wight soon after three the afternoon of that day. At that time the wind was light and the sea smooth, although at noon there had been a fresh breeze blowing. The ship had all plain sails set, with studding sails on the port side; the wind from the southwest, and being on the port quarter. Thus it will be seen that she was under a heavy press of canvas, though those who saw her say that it was not too much, considering the force of the wind that time.

THE MOMENT OF THE DISASTER.

From what could be gathered this morning from the two survivors, prior to their being despatched to Portsmouth to see the Commanderin-in-Chief, it seems that, 3.30 p.m., they, in common with many their comrades, were on the lower deck having tea. About quarter to four, Cuddiford says he heard the boatswain's mate pipe hands to shorten sail, and he and others at once proceeded on deck to execute the order. On getting up the ladder, however, he found that the ship had been struck by a tremendous squall, which had first come from the north-west, and that she was heeling over very fast on the starboard side. Captain Hare was the bridge giving instructions for shortening the sail, but this was never actually done, as the men on deck, seeing that the ship was rapidly turning over, proceeded to jump from her side into the sea. Cuddiford and Fletcher, the two survivors, both did this, and they attribute their being rescued alive to their knowledge of swimming. Cuddiford says that three or four minutes elapsed between the pipe to shorten sail and the ship going down, and an indication of the time of the vessel foundering is given by the watch found on the body of Captain Ferrier, R.E., which stopped precisely at eight minutes four.

FIRST TIDINGS OF THE CATASTROPHE.

The first tidings of the disaster were communicated to the shore the captain of the schooner Emma, of Padstow. He anchored his vessel off the coastguard station at Ventnor, and hoisted a signal of distress, upon which the inspecting officer of coastguards, Commander Roche, and the chief officer proceeded to her a boat. On learning the true nature of things, Commander Roche despatched some of his men for medical assistance, and, with others, tried to restore animation to the five persons who had been rescued. Two surgeons of Ventnor were very soon in attendance, but all efforts to restore life failed, except in the case of Cuddiford and Fletcher, who, when they could be removed, were taken on shore and treated the Cottage Hospital. The bodies were removed to the shore, and placed in shed near the Esplanade.

NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE EMMA.

The captain of the schooner Emma afforded the following information:– He stated that he was on voyage from Padstow to Poole in ballast, and that he was proceeding up Channel on Sunday afternoon, when he observed the Eurydice with all sail set. She was much nearer the land than his vessel. He observed that the wind was shifting about and the weather looking threatening, consequently he shortened sail. The squall was accompanied by a very heavy fall of snow, and when this had cleared away be looked around and could see no signs of tho Eurydice. He continued on his course when suddenly he heard someone shouting for assistance. He once lowered a boat, which succeeded in picking five persons and bringing them on board the schooner. He cruised about the spot for some time, but being unable to observe any one else, he then stood in for the shore. The five persons rescued by the Emma proved Benjamin Cuddiford, able seaman, of the Eurydice, whose home is at Plymouth; Sydney Fletcher, ordinary seaman, of the Rover, who was taking passage in the Eurydice, and who resides Bristol; Lieutenant Francis Hope Tabor, First Lieutenant of the Eurydice, who resided at Cheam, Surrey; Captain Terrier, R.E., who was taking passage in the Eurydice; and petty officer, named Bennett, late of the Rover, who was also taking passage. It is known that Bennett was married man, but neither of the rescued men have any idea where his wife resides. The captain of the schooner believes that Lieut. Tabor, Captain Ferrier, and Bennett were dead when they were pioked up, and in this view the medical men concurred.

DISTRESSING SCENE

A heardrending scene occurred this afternoon when Mrs. Tabor, who had been married to the deceased officer but 15 months arrived in town, and proceeded to identify the body of her husband. Her grief was terrible to behold, so great, indeed, that the men who had charge of the house where the remains lay, felt themselves unable to remain in the place, leaving the unfortunate lady alone with the dead.

THE SURVIVORS INTERVIEWED.  
[CENTRAL NEWS TELEGRAM. |

Portsmouth, Monday Night.  
With reference to the wreck the Eurydice, matters remain much about the same as this, morning. This afternoon, the two survivors were by special orders brought to Admiral Tenchore at Portsmouth, by whom they were interviewed , privately for the information of the Admiralty. Subsequently they were seen by the Central News Portsmouth, correspondent, to whom the following information was detailed:— Ben. Cuddiford, 35, single, said: I was able seaman on board the Eurydice. I was on the port watch Sunday afternoon. I went on deck at noonday. There were then one hundred and fifty men deck in the watch. We were to come off watch at four o'clock. We were under full sail, making for Spithead. We set the lowest studsail just before two o'olock, and took it in again about quarter to four, just when the gale and snow storm came upon us. We had taken in the lower studsails and were about to take in the upper sails, the men being aloft, when the ship gave a lurch, and the captain ordered the men to come down, as the ship was listing over to starboard, and the water was coming over the lee bulwarks. I cannot say whether they had got down when the ship turned over. I was the weather side, letting go the ropes to let the sails ease off. After the first turn over she righted a bit, some few feet, and then went down bow first. As she sank, she gradually turned over, and I and number of men got on to the bottom near the keel. The captain was also on the bottom and remained fast. I and some other men jumped astern of the sinking ship, which remained on her side for about five minutes and then went down bow first. I and another seaman, who was afterwards drowned, tried to cut away the cutter on the port side of the ship as she was sinking. We had got one of the grips undone when the vessel went down, and we were obliged leave it. I picked up a lifebuoy, and having fastened to myself struck out away from the ship. As the vessel sank the suction carried down a number of people. I passed the two surgeons, but could not render them any assistance. One of them, Mr. Murdock, was has shirt sleeves, but they were too much exhausted to cry out. The wind was just abaft the beam on the port tack. There were four guns on board, but all were well secured. The ports, however, were opened. Captain Hare was very fond of the ship, and all the crew had great faith in her. The captain was on deck in charge of the watch, and was giving orders just before we were struck by the gale. We were going about eight and a half knots, and there was no sign of a squall. About ten minutes to four were turned on dock to lower studsails and to get in upper sails. As I have before stated, when the captain ordered us down from aloft I did not hear anything carried away, and cannot say Whether any of the masts went by the board. There were about 150 men on deck altogether in the watch.

SCENES THE WATER.

I saw one of the officers, Mr. Murdock, swimming in the water. I also saw the boatswain, Mr. Brewer, swimming about. He was much exhausted, and his eyes appeared to be starting out of his head. I was in water about one hour and twenty minutes. I did not seem to feel the cold until I stepped on to the deck of the schooner that rescued us, and then I appeared to lose consciousness. The seaman named Bennett, captain of the quarter-deck, was the man who tried to get away the cutter with me. Poor fellow, he was drowned. His wife saw him off at Portsmouth. Lieut. Tabor and Captain Ferrier, of the Royal Engineers, were also in the water with us, but both died after getting on board the schooner that rescued us. We were very kindly treated on board the Emma. I saw several men pass me in the water, and two surgeons, but they were too exhausted to speak.

IN THE GRASP OF DEATH.

Sydney Fletcher, 19, single, belonging to Bristol, corroborated the narrative of Cuddiford, and added that, on jumping off the wreck, a number of men attempted to seize them in the endeavour to be saved. They had, however, most reluctantly to push them off. One poor fellow seized Fletcher's cork waistcoat, and in order to save himself he had to thrust the unfortunate man away, and he sank to rise no more. The cries of the drowning were most piteous to listen to.

THE CAPTAIN FIRM AT HIS POST.

The last time the survivors saw the captain, was when he was standing firm to his post on the sinking vessel. As she disappeared beneath the waves, dozens of poor fellows were dragged down by the vortex caused by the sinking vessel. Having made their depositions to the Admiral, at Portsmouth, the two survivors returned to the Isle Wight, in the charge of Dr. Wells, of , Ventnor. The two men were eagerly questioned by many relatives of those who had gone down in the Eurydice, and the effect upon them, caused by the hopeless answers of the survivors, was most distressing to witness.

LIST OF THE SHIP'S OFFICERS.

Ventnor, Moday Night.

The wreck is lying directly in the course of vessels going up and down Channel, and efforts are now being made to remove the masts, sails, and rigging, for which purpose riggers, shipwrights, and divers from Portsmouth dockyard are employed.

The officers of the Eurydice included the following: —Captain Marcus A. S. Hare, Lieut. Francis H. Tabor, Lieut. Charles V. Strange, Lieut. J. E. Black, Lieut. Stanley, A. B. Burney, staff surgeon; Jas. L. Whitney, paymaster; Frank Pitman, sub-lieutenant; Hon. Edward B. Gifferd, sub-lieutenant; Herbert S. Edmunds, sub-lieutenant; Walter S. Smith, sub-lieutenant; Sidney G. Randolph, surgeon; Robt. Murdock, M.B., gunner; Fredk. Allen, boatswain; Wm. Brewer, boatswain; Joseph Warren, assistant-clerk; Wm. Lamont, sub-lieutenant. The Hon. Edward Robert Gifford was brother and heir-presumptive to Lord Gifford, who served with distinction in the Ashantee expedition. The bodies of Captain Terrier and of Mr. Bennett, petty officer, were identified by the survivors.

THE INQUEST AND VERDICT.

On Tuesday afternoon, the Coroner for the Isle of Wight, Mr. Frederick Blake, opened an inquest on the bodies Francis Hope Tabor, late first-lieutenant of the Eurydice, Captain L.ouis John George Ferrier, R.E., and Bennett, a petty officer, which had been landed from the schooner Emma by the crew of which vessel they had been picked up, along with the two survivors. The jury consisted of 13 gentlemen residing Ventnor.

Mr. R. Montagu Tabor said he lived Carshalton, Surrey. He had seen the body which had been viewed the jury, and he identified it as his brother, Lieut. Tabor. He last saw him alive about five or six months ago. He had since been to the West Indies in the Eurydice, and was on his way home her when the catastrophe occurred. Deceased would have been 30 years of age in July next.

Benjamin Cuddiford said; I am an A.B., and reside at Millbay, Plymouth. I have seen the bodies of three deceased, and I am able to identity them. They are Lieut. Tabor, a man named Bennett, I do not know his Christian name, and a Captain of R.E., who was taking passage in the ship. Lieut. Tabor was first lieutenant on the Eurydice, and I was A. B. on board her. Bennett was captain of the quarter deck. She was a wooden sailing ship of four guns, She has been employed as a training ship, having been thirteen months on commission. During the winter she has been all round the West India Islands. Her captain was Captain Marcus Hare. We left Bermuda on our homeward voyage on the 6th March, being bound for Portsmouth. I should think, but I am not certain, that we had over 300 officers and men on board, including supernumeraries. There were about 30 men belonging the ship's company and the rest were ordinary seamen, who, at the conclusion of a training, leave the ship. On Sunday last, just before two o'clock, we were turned on deck to set the lower studding soil. The ship was then off the Isle of Wight. All plain sail had been set before this. All was set except the topgallant studding sails, and they were unbent. The weather at that time was very fine, the wind, which was blowing a moderate breeze, being just abaft the beam. Between 3.30 and 4 o'clock the port watch was called to take in the lower studding sail. We had not then encountered a squall, but it was looking dirty. Captain Hare gave the order, saying " Watch in, lower studding sail." It was then coming on to blow hard. This sail was taken in, and Captain Hare then gave orders to the royal yacht men go aloft and take the royals. They were not taken in as the squall then struck us, and Capt. Hare ordered the men from aloft for their safety. The royals were, I believe, lowered at beat time, but not furled. The captain gave orders as the squall caught to let go the maintopsail halfyards and the mainsheet. That was done, as I saw the gunner's mate let them go. The ship was thence on her beam ends, the men on the lee side being up to their waists in water. I heard the captain say to som one forward—"If you can't let go, cut it". I expect the captain was referring to the foresheet, but can't say. I then climbed up and got on the weather netting, and crawled on to the ship's side, as she was turning over. I did this to get on the weather side of the ship. I could see her keel and her sails were in the water. She righted a few feet, and I saw her mizen topsail out of the water. Then I looked forward and saw the ship sinking from forward, taking down a body of men with her. The water then began to increase aft, and just as it got in ine with the mainmast she turned over, and the boats turned bottom over. The ship's keel was then out of the water. I stuck to the ship, and the captain gave me orders to try and get the cutter clear by cutting the gripes. I cut the forward gripe, and then the water encroached us. The captain was just behind me on the side of the ship. The man who was helping me cut the gripe. He was named Richards, and was washed away, he being, I think, numbed with the cold. I saw the two doctors jump overboard, and I soon after did the same. I passed the two doctors drowning, but could not render them any assistance. I observed many others m the water. I swam round and got a life buoy, and then went to the assistance of others, giving them pieces of wood and spars. I had on lifebuoy. The ship must have gone down just as I jumped off. The captain was still on her side, and he went down on her. I saw six men on the bottom of a boat called the copper punt. I spoke to them. They asked me if there was any hope, and I told them to keep their spirits up. They were washed off the bottom of the punt one by one. I saw one let go owing to the cold. One of the men clinging to the boat was called Mason, another Martin. There was a cook's mate who was taking passage home, he having been left behind by the Tamar. The other three men were ordinary seamen. I saw one other person, Mr. Brewer, the boatswain, with a lifebuoy. As the squall came on I turned my back to it. When the mist cleared away I saw Fletcher near me. I made for the shore, and he did the same. We were swimming about for an hour and 20 minutes, when we were picked up by the schooner. When I got to my feet on the schooner I felt giddy. I was sensible when they picked me up, as I got hold of a rope which they flung to me.

By the Jury: came to blow between 3 and 3.30. We had afterwards a tremendous squall, which must have been the cause of the capsizing of the vessel. A snowstorm came on, and we could not see the land. There was an attempt to bring her up to the wind, there being five men at the wheel, and the Hon. Mr. Gifford, sub-lieutenant, went to assist them. An attempt was made to put the helm up after we could not take in the royals. I cannot say if the helm was put up or not. When the ship was on even keel, the ports were four or five feet above water. The guns were well secured on board, and were not shifted at all. There was one watch, which might number 150, below at the time the order was given to shorten sail. They were writing and sleeping. The captain gave orders to shorten sail as soon as he saw the squall coming quick.

The Coroner: Who was the officer of the watch at the time?— Witness: I recollect now, which I didn't yesterday, that Sub-Lieutenant Randolph was the officer of the watch. He was forward, helping to shorten sail when the squall came on. The ship went down five minutes after she first got on her beam ends. When she first heeled, the starboard quarter boats were filled and carried away. The galley was smashed, and it was impossible to lower any of the boats. The captain was on deck just before the squall came on. There was a life buoy on each side of the bridge, and one on each bow of the launch forward, and one astern— five, in all, on deck. There were about twelve lifebelts in one of the launches, as they had been in use the day before, when the men were over the side painting.

By Mr. Harvey: Directly the captain saw the squall coming, he ordered the reduction of sail, and the largest one in the ship was taken in at once, that being the lower studding sail. The men were lowering the royals when the captain, seeing the squall coming on, shouted them down, and added—"Let go-the main topsail halyards and the main sheet." The captain ordered the men down for fear the topgallant mast and royal mast would be carried away with the men on it.

Mr. Harvey: As an able seaman do you think there was any fault in seamanship to account for the loss of this vessel?— Witness: No, sir. The captain was a thorough seaman, and so were all the officers. I have been in the service nearly 21 years, and I have never seen a squall come so suddenly before.

Captain George Henry Ferrier, of the 105th regiment, now quartered Colchester, identified the body of his brother, Captain Louis John George Ferrier, R.E., who was quartered at Bermuda. He was, witness surmised, coming home on leave, and probably the captain of the Eurydice gave him a passage. Deceased was in his 38th year.

Sydney Fletcher, aged 19, said: I was first-class orderly seaman on board the Eurydice. It was my watch below last Sunday from noon to four p.m. was getting my tea to come on watch at that time, when I heard a rush of water coming in through the ports which are on the main deck. Immediately before that she had given a rather strong lurch. I lowered the after port and ran on deck. The water was then coming over the starboard nettings. I assisted in overhauling the foretop sail halyards. I then got over the port netting and walked right aft on the side of the ship. I walked below her ports. She was then on her side and the water nearly amidships. It was blowing hard and snowing at the time, and the sea was breaking over the ship. I saw the captain standing on the side of the ship giving orders to clear away the cutter. I picked a life belt and jumped into the sea. Mr. Edwards, the sub-lieutenant, took off his coat and jumped overboard just as did. I saw Lieutenant Tabor on the side of the ship in his shirt sleeves and without his cap. I also saw him in the water floating on a wash deck locker. I shouted to the schooner and was so full of joy when I saw her I did not know what was doing. I saw Bennett and the boatswain floating me. I did not notice the wind increase before the ship lurched. I do not think more than two men of the starboard watch got on deck besides me. I heard them crying and screaming. I got up as my mess was close to the forward hatchway. I know that we had iron ballast, and that the water and stores acted as ballast as well.

Cuddiford recalled said the Eurydice had the proper ballast for her tonnage, and beyond that there was a lower tier of tanks, full of water, which was never disturbed.

William Langworthy Jenkins said: I am master of the schooner Emma, of Padstow, and on Sunday last I was proceeding from Newcastle to Poole. About 10 minutes past 4 we encountered a sudden squall, while we were off Dunnose. Previously to it coming on it was looking bad to the windward. Therefore I ordered the flying jib to hauled down and also the main top mast staysail and other sails. Afterwards I lowered foresail. Then I only had the standing jib set properly on my ship. We did this during tne squall which lasted half an hour. The Emma was from four to five miles from land when the squall struck her. I saw nothing of the Eurydice before she went down, but after the snowstorm I saw something floating on the water, and it being reported to be a man I steered towards it. I heard cries for help and found five men floating. They were about a quarter of a mile apart from one another. We picked them up and all were exhausted and insensible. We took them in the cabin and stripped them and rubbed them. Cuddiford and Fletcher were able to take some coffee, but the others could not. Medical men came, but three were dead then, Bennett, fact, was dead when he was picked up. I should not have thought the squall was of such force as to capsize such a vessel as the Eurydice, even when under full sail.

Dr. Winson proved having tried to restore animation to the deceased, but failed to do so. He believed death resulted from drowning in each case.

Henry Parkinson, able seaman on board the Emma, proved seeing the Eurydice ten minutes before the squall. She had plain sail on her, and it was not, in his opinion, too much, considering the weather, for her to be then carrying. He was surprised to hear of her loss. He had been in a great deal heavier squalls, and he noticed in some cases a vessel dismantled, while another close by had escaped.

Photographs showing the partiality of this squall were put in.

This being all the evidence, and the Jury believing the whole of the facts which could be before them had been proved, the Coroner proceeded to sum up.

VERDICT.

The jury retired, and after an absence of half hour, returned with the following verdict:— "The jury unanimously find that the three deceased were accidentally drowned owing to the capsizing of her Majesty's ship Eurydice, by a sudden squall, at Dunnose, on Sunday, the 24th inst., and the jury consider that, from the evidence adduced, no blame whatever can attach to the captain, officers, and men of the ship."

LOSS OF H.M.S. EURYDICE, WITH THREE HUNDRED MEN

The wreck of the Eurydice, the training-ship for young ordinary seamen, of the Isle of Wight, and almost within sight of Spithead, to which place she was approaching at the end of a pleasant and successful cruise to the West Indies, is a disaster which calls to mind the loss of the Captain off Cape Finisterre. With this exception, there is nothing to compare with the calamity which occurred on Sunday afternoon, so far as the Navy is concerned, though the loss of life has frequently been exceeded by the sinking of emigrant-vessels. The circumstances are similar in many respects to those attending the loss of the Captain, both ships having turned over and sunk during a gale of wind, all their sail being at the time set. So far as can be ascertained, the Eurydice had 368 souls on board at the time. But this is very much a matter of conjecture, as, besides her own officers and crew, she was bringing home a number of military officers, supernumeraries, and invalids from the West Indies. Hence considerable uncertainty exists both as to the names and number of the sufferers.

The Eurydice was a wooden, full-rigged sailing ship of 921 tons displacement, and was at one time considered one of the smartest and quickest twenty-six-gun frigates in the service. She was built about 1843. Last year she was converted into a training-ship for ordinary seamen at Mr. John White's yard at Cowes, and was completed for sea at Portsmouth Dockyard. She was commissioned on Feb. 7, 1877, and finally sailed from Portsmouth on Nov. 13 with a crew of about 300 ordinary seamen and the officers. All the officers and crew are lost, with the exception of two seamen.

Captain Marcus Hare had been at one time Commander of the St. Vincent, training-ship at Portsmouth, and was selected for the command from his knowledge and experience of young seamen. Lieutenant Francis Tabor was a thoroughly efficient sailor, haying had command of the Cruiser in the Mediterranean. Among the other officers who have perished is Sub-Lieutenant the Hon. Edward Robert Gifford, next brother to Lord Gifford. The Eurydice was accompanied from Portsmouth by the training-brig Martin, and was joined at Madeira by the Liberty from Plymouth. These vessels were filled with ordinary seamen, whom it was considered necessary to inure to the sea by a long cruise : and. as they were all draughted from the home training-ships, the distress caused by their loss is spread over the whole country. They were young and mostly unmarried men ; in this respect the crew differs from that of the Captain, who were principally able-bodied seamen and petty officers. The Liberty arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago, the Eurydice being detained for the purpose of taking up supernumeraries. Captain Hare, however, expected to be home almost as soon as the Martin.

The Eurydice left Bermuda on the 6th inst., and nothing was heard of her until she was seen by the coastguard at Bonchurch, at 3.30 on Sunday afternoon, bearing for Spithead under all plain sail, and with her port stunsails set on the fore-topmast and maintopinast, the object being clearly to arrive at the anchorage at Spithead before nightfall. There was an ominous stillness prevailing at this time. A heavy bank of clouds was coming down from the north-west, and the glass was falling rapidly. Such wind as there was came from the westward, and blew on the port quarter of the ship.

The Isle of Wight is of peculiar formation on its southern fringe, having what may be considered as a double coast line extending from Blackgang Chine as far as Shanklin. The inner circle of the downs reaches a height of 500 ft. above the sea, and affords a deceptive shelter to ships well in shore. From the direction in which the Eurydice was steering she would be in comparatively smooth water, sheltered by the downs, until she rounded Dunnose Head, where the disaster occurred. This circumstance will also serve to explain the fact that the Emma, schooner, which was near at the time, was not affected by the gale.

At ten minutes to four the wind suddenly veered round from the west to the eastward, and a gale, accompanied by a blinding fall of snow, came rushing from the high lands down Luccombe Chine, striking the Eurydice just a little before the beam, driving her out of her course, which was heading to the north-east, and turning her bows to the east. This is what seems probable, though, from the manner in which the sea was concealed by the snow, nothing was seen of her at the supreme moment when she capsized to starboard. The air cleared as suddenly as it became overcast, the wind sinking away at the same time. 

As soon as anything could be seen, the masts and top-hamper of the ship were discerned above the water about 2 3/4 miles ENE. off Dunnose, a well-known and lofty landmark between Shanklin and Ventnor. The ship lies in eleven fathoms of water, and from her position she appears to have righted in going down.

Of the whole number of souls on board, only two persons succeeded in reaching the shore alive. These are an able seaman named Benjamin Cuddiford, a native of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, an ordinary first-class seaman, aged nineteen, belonging to Bristol. Lieutenant Tabor died before reaching the shore, and the only other bodies which have been recovered are those of Colonel Ferrier, R.E., and a petty officer named Bennett. Their bodies, which were picked up as they drifted towards Ventnor on an ebb tide, were taken into a cottage at Ventnor, to await the Coroner's inquiry.

The two survivors were first taken to the Esplanade and subsequently to the Cottage Hospital at Bonchurch, where they were attended by Dr. Williamson, of Ventnor, for the night. They were both brought over to Portsmouth on Monday afternoon. Much surprise has been caused by the small number rescued, and this more especially as the time being at hand for the changing of the watch a great many men would be on deck at the time. It appears, too, that the crew were assembling for prayers. Ordinary seamen are taught swimming as part of their training for the sea. No doubt numbers threw themselves overboard when the ship capsized, and were sucked down by the ship and carried out to sea by the tide ; but it is likely that the majority succumbed through becoming chilled by the cold

Captain Langworthy Jenkins, master of the Emma schooner, bound from Newcastle for Poole with coals, was the means of rescuing the survivors, and brought his ship into Portsmouth. He states that at forty-five minutes past four on Sunday afternoon, after a heavy squall, the atmosphere cleared, and he observed some wreckage and the royals of a ship flapping above the water. He also fancied he heard some one shouting for assistance. He sent a man into the rigging to look out, who reported that he saw a man floating in the water with a cork jacket. He immediately made sail and stood towards him. Having to tack once to fetch him, he hoisted out boats, which picked up four men, and one man was picked up from the ship. He did his best to restore their circulation, but one of the men had died before he was got on board. Captain Jenkins then stood for Ventor with colours half-mast high and a boat came off. A doctor was sent for, but two other men died before he arrived. The Coastguard boat afterwards came alongside with Commander Roach, who recognised the body of Lieutenant Tabor, the First Lieutenant of the Eurydice, and the other as an officer of the Royal Engineers. When the men were picked up, Dunnoee bore NW. by W. three to four miles.
 
The boy Fletcher is too weak to furnish full particulars of the sad affair. He states, however, that he was below with the greater part of the crew, when, hearing a noise, he rushed up the hatchway and heard a cry, "All hands for themselves !" He caught a life-buoy and jumped overboard, as did also the rest who were picked up. A minute afterwards the ship gave a lurch forward and sank, drawing him down to a considerable distance; but the life-buoy raised him again. In an account given by Cuddiford, which we insert below, is stated that the ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm, at, as nearly as he can state, four o'clock in the afternoon, when they were five miles from Dunnose. There were over 300 men on board, all of whom, except himself and Sydney Fletcher, who belonged to the Rover, were, he thought, drowned.

A telegram having been forwarded on Sunday evening to the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth informing him of the occurrence, Admiral Fanshawe at once dispatched the two Government tugs the Grinder and the Camel to the wreck, in charge of Commanders Polkinghome and Dathan, the two Master Attendants of the yard. The wreck was reached about midnight. The ship was found lying on her starboard bilge, on a fine sandy beach, in eleven fathoms of water, and with her head about south-east, having almost slewed round during the circular storm. Her fore and mizen topgallant masts had been carried away, the topgallant sails hung before the topsails, with the main topgallant masts standing, and all her sails set. Leaving Commander Dathan in charge of the wreck, Commander Polkinghome came back to Portsmouth at five o'clock on Monday morning to report to the Commander-in-Chief and to dispatch the requisite aid. The Grinder accordingly sailed to the spot with twenty-five riggers, some shipwrights, and a couple of divers, with the necessary gear. The sails and tophamper of the wreck were removed, and the tugs will remain to watch the spot. There will be no difficulty in raising the ship by means of lumps. As a matter of form, a court-martial will be held upon the two survivors. These two on arrival at Portsmouth, were taken to Admiralty House, before the Commander-in-Chief, and were afterwards taken to Ventnor, in order that they might give evidence before the county Coroner for the Isle of Wight. Before leaving Portsmouth, Cuddiford made a statement to Admiral Foley of the circumstances attending the wreck. He said: 

"At seven bells on Sunday afternoon the watch at a quarter to four o’clock was called to take in lower studdingsails. I was on deck to tend the lower tack, and let it go. The Captain gave orders to take in the upper sails. The wind was then freshening. The Captain ordered the men to come down from aloft and then to let go the topsail-halliards. The gunner's mate let go the topsail-halliards, and another man, Bryant, let the mainsheet. The water was then running over the lee netting on the starboard side, and washed away the cutter. The foretopmast studding-sail was set. The wind was about a point abaft the port beam. I caught hold of the main truss, fell, and caught hold of the weather netting and got on the ship’s side. We could see her keel. She righted a little before going down, ringing the mizen-topsail out of the water. She then went gradually over from forward, the greater part of the hands being at the forepart of the ship outside. She then turned over, bringing the port cutter bottom upwards. I and another, Richards, out the foremost gripe, and then saw the Captain standing on the vessel's side near the quarter-boat and the two doctors struggling in the water. I swam some distance, keeping over my head a lifebuoy, which I found, and then picked up some piece of wreck, which I gave to some of the men in the water. I then came across the copper punt full of water, five men were it. The sea capsized the punt, and they all got on the bottom. They asked me if there was any signs of help. I told them that the best thing they could do was to keep their spirits up. One of them was just letting go his hold of the punt. Ido not know his name. I next saw Mr. Brewer, the boatswain, with a cork lifebelt on. He was struggling strongly. I then saw Fletcher in the water with a cork belt and breaker. I lost sight of him during the snow. About five minutes afterwards the weather cleared up. I saw Fletcher again, and we kept together. Then we saw land, but, finding it too rough, we turned our backs to the land and saw a schooner. The schooner bore down on us, sent a boat, and picked up two officers that I had not previously noticed with a wash-deck locker. A rope's end was thrown to me from the schooner, and I was then picked up. I judge that I was in the water one hour and twenty minutes. The officers picked up were Lieutenant Tabor and a captain of the Royal Engineers who came on board at Bermuda with one corporal, one bombardier, four privates, and a servant of officer of the Royal Engineers. The ship capsized about ten minutes before four o'clock. The captain was giving orders at the time, and was carrying out his duty. We rounded on the weather beam, and set the lower studding-sail, at two p.m. The ship was then going eight knots and a half. I don't know who was the officer of the watch, as the captain was carrying on the duty. The Hon. Mr. Gifford went to the wheel to help at the time the water was coming over the lee nettings, in consequence of an order being given to put the helm up. There were the following supernumeraries on board :—Three court-martial prisoners from the Rover; one A.B., court-martial prisoner from Bermuda; an ordinary seaman, named Parker, who had been tried by court-martial (he belonged to the Eurydice); and about twelve or fourteen Marines, with one sergeant of Marines from Bermuda Dockyard, two invalids from Bermuda Hospital, one ship's corporal from the Argus, one captain's cook from the Argus, one engineer's steward from the Argus, one ship's cook from Bermuda Dockyard, one quartermaster, named Nicholas, from the Rover. I believe some of the maindeck ports were open to let in the air to the main-deck mess. I don't think the hands were turned ; there was hardly time for that. I saw most of the men forward take off their clothes and jump off before I lost sight of them in the squall. When the snow cleared the ship was gone down."

During Monday the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth was in constant communication with her Majesty and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty; and in the course of the day he received the following telegrams from the Queen. The first, which came direct from her Majesty, was in the following terms:—

"The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further details."

The second was transmitted to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and was to the following effect:—

"The Queen would ask Mr. Smith to make known her grief at the terrible calamity to the Eurydioe, and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted friends and relatives."

In another telegram to Mr. Smith the Queen said the telegrams had caused her the greatest grief. These telegrams, haying been forwarded to Admiral Fanshawe, were promptly posted at the dockyard gates, where they were eagerly read by sympathetic crowds.

Admiral Foley visited the wreck in the course of the afternoon, and, from an examination of the rigging and gear of the ship, he is firmly of opinion that the crew were in the act of shortening sail at the time the ship sank. In this opinion he is supported by the pilots who are assisting at the wreck. They found that the topsails had been let go, and that the mizentopsail was actually resting on the cap. The squall, however was evidently too sudden and powerful for the crew to relieve the ship in time. There is also reason for concluding that the ports on both sides were open, and that the water rushed in on the starboard side, which prevented the ship from righting and pulled her over. The divers and riggers were engaged on Monday in relieving the wreck of her spars and sails. No attempt has yet been made to penetrate below decks. It is expected that a month will elapse before the ship can be raised and brought into harbour.

The inquest on the bodies of Lieutenant Tabor, Captain Louis Ferrier, R.E., and an ordinary seaman named Bennett, was held at Ventnor on Tuesday, by Mr. F. Blake, Coroner for the Isle of Wight. Mr. E. J. Harvey, of Portsmouth, attended as agent for the Admiralty, with Commander Roche, of the Coastguard. The principal evidence was that of Benjamin Cuddiford and of Sydney Fletcher the only survivors from the Eurydice; and that of Captain Jenkins, master of the Emma schooner, which they were picked up. The statement of Cuddiford at the inquest was not materially different from that which he had before made to the Port Admiral, and which is given above; it was confirmed by the evidence of Fletcher. The jury found, as their verdict, that the deceased persons "were accidentally drowned by the capsizing of H.M.S. Eurydice a sudden squall, and that no blame whatever can be attached to the captain, officers, and men of the ship."

A committee has been formed at Portsmouth, and another in London, to raise money for the benefit of the families of the seamen and marines who have lost their lives this disaster. Messrs. Glyn, Mills, and Co., of Lombard-street, and Messrs. Cocks and Biddulph, of Charing-cross, receive subscriptions for this purpose. The members of the House of Commons have made a special subscription amongst themselves.

Our Illustration of the foundering of the Eurydice, which forms the large Engraving presented for the Extra Supplement this week, has been drawn by the aid of Sketches and verbal description supplied by the seaman Benjamin Cuddiford, one of the two survivors of the crew.
