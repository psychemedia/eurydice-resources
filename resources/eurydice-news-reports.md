The Eurydice, 26, building Portsmouth upon the plan laid down Admiral Elliot, will launched next month. She is constructed on the draught of the Vestal, with an increase of length and a decrease of beam, and the reduction of the angle of the floor, which will reduce her draught of water about 18 inches. This vessel is extremely clean abaft and forward, and there is no doubt she will have great velocity ; but, in all probability, she will prove very wet.

WEATHERLINESS OF THE EURYDICE.

To the Editor of the Hampshire Telegraph.

Sir, -I learn that the Eurydice draws two feet less water than is usual with ships of war of her size and tonnage. Now this fact, connected as it is with her superior capabilities on a winid, appears to me, to be as a relation of thinigs that deserves no slight consideration-one inideed that ought to be scrutinizingly looked into ; because the quiality of ships' weatherliness is taught by some ship designers to depend on the amiounit of their respective *lateral resistance*, or the quantity of immersed area of the greatest longitudinal sectton a vessel when on the wind offers to the floating medium. 



That thlis is fl very prevalent opinlion need Por: not be urged onl those wvho attend to changes made ini order to imuprove leewuardly vessels and those carrying C e b.lack helms'i for the alterationis theou effected in ttheu e are ievarliahiy in accordance wvith it, and found to con2s sist eithler in brhigrini them dowvn inl the water b~y 1V Y meesims ot' nioro ballast, givingf thletim additionial f~als'e S'i'(t keel, or gripeb or increaise of t'oretout.

The caser ot' thc Jlmnydfce, asaC contradictionl to the entire truth ot' this taught principle, in my opinionl, formis anlh i-- stance of'a very strikiiig kind, sinice we find in her tihe iipoisession ot' th~e quality ?? great wveatheiliness, (0o-0 'f loined with dimin~utipn. of later al resistance.

A letter from Lieut. Sabben, R.N. on a subject of considerable interest to naval men — namely, the cause of " weatherliness" in ships, as illustrated by that apparent in H.M.S. Eurydice, was published by our local contemporary some little time since. It msy not be irregular, if we say a few words on the subject, without going into Lieut. Sabben's theory, which would be "dry" — and therefore unpardonable. 

e doubt whether " giving additional false keel, or gripe, or increase of forefoot," be " futile contrivances," by way of making a ship more weatherly when deficient in that important quality ; — they will oot turn a bad ship into a good one, any more than s pair of spectacles will do the same for defective sight ; but that such things have something to do wilh " weatberiiness," universal experience seems to attest. We also doubt extremely the fact alluded to. concerning vessels which have the faculty of being lifted bodily to windward, and making " weather " way, instead of " leeway"; and, con- sequently, having to reckon the former instead of the latter in their calculations on a voyage. Tbat aome sailors M say " that some ships do this, proves little : we have heard it said that musket balls rise on leaving the barrel. The question of how accu- rately ships do "fetch tbe point they look up to," is very interesting in each individual case, and should be carefully tried, when, and where, no weather or lee, tide or current, lurks as a disturbing cause. Rut our concern is with Lieut. Sabben's data, the chief of which is the weatherliness of the Eurydice. 1 She has " little " (comparative) "lateral resist-] smce" ;— is that quite certain ? Does not length, I and great length of keel, give this ? and is not the Eurydice longer, considerably, " than ships of war of her size and tonnage" : ex. gr. Sir W. Symonds's 26s ? We do not presume to speak positively ; and are quite sure that Lieut. S. is well able to set us right, if we are not so ; but we should have guessed that the " lateral resistance " of Eurydice, waa at leaat equal to that 'of Vestal, for instance : a ship of tbe claas with which alone Eurydice is to be com- pared, with any fairness. Our own very clumsy notion is, that " very dif- ferent, indeed opposite arrangements of the elements ofa ship's form," may produce almost equal ex- cellence, in onr present state of knowledge of the subject be it remembered, and without saying tbat there is not one leading principle of form which may be perfect, supposing we could get at it. Now, ob- serve these trials of Eurydice and Warspite ; the formerly certainly had tbe advantage ; we never for a momcnl doubted that sbe would — at least, we always expected it. But there was a third vessel in company, dnring (we think) most of those trials— H.M. brig Grecian, built on a plan much more un- like both Warspite and Eurydice, than either of these was unlike tbe other, with the very form which Lient. S. thinks a mistaken one— namely, with ' great rise of floor" — in fact, a complete wedge ; and yet she went to windward of both ships. So that the facts are these— here were three ships, differing in model many ways, and especially as to their midship sections — one having a flat floor, tbat of an old two-decked ship ; tbe other having a sharper form, with a very deep " hollow," but still with con- siderabse fulness ; the third with what Captain Rous called a "peg-top midship section" ; and the result of tbe trials pieces tbe flattest-floored ship most to leeward ; the mezao-termine next ; and little peg- top spinning away to windward of all 1 Now we do not infer that therefore the flatter-floored a aliip is tbe lest weatberiy she is, and tbe sharper tbe more ao— tbere a hundred otber things to be thought of, and otber trials might give other result* ; but there are the facts. We are to remember that, as yet, Eurydice has had no trial with any ship of her own class, and with which she was built expressly to compete — namely, Sir W. Symonds's beautiful 265 ; but we may give it as an opinion — perhaps a worthless one — that hei model is superior to theirs. Again, we are all to recollect that there is another ship on tbe same plan as Eurydice, now of some standing and known character in the service — the corvette Modeste. This ship was for some time in company with the Rover, a corvette of precisely similar claas, but on the almost opposite plan of Sir W. Symonds. We never saw any official account of their trials, but we bad our's from the officer then commanding H.MS. Vestal, and under whose orders Rover and Modeste tben were; he had frequent opportunities of judging of these two representations of opposite systems, under a variety of circumstances. The result was that, taking one thing with another, they were very equal in excellence ; tbe superiority of Modeste, as to speed, was off tbe wind, or in smooth water ; tbat of Rover, invariably, was close-hauled, and especially wben blowing fresh. Tbat is, be it observed, just at the time wben the " mechanical action " of tbe ?? body " on the " floating medium," spoken of by Lieutenant Sabben, would come into operation. We only throw oot these facts for bis consideration, or that of any one whom they may i. tercet, without in any way meaning to dogmatise on them. All will agree with Lieut. S. that the closest attention should be paid to the position of tbe ** greatest breadth ;" for. as yet, opinions differ about it considerably. All will agree, likewise, that whatever tends to " thiow " tbe weather bow " up to windward," lias ' tbe same tendency as regards ?? the entire ship ;" it being proverbial tbat, " where tbe head is, tbe body will not be far behind," unless the ship should have tbe mishap to come in two, and its dissevered portions should start, each on its own account. Lieut. S. is of course aware that in the case of the " Symondian " ships (tbe sharpest, and we really think, taken as a wbole, the most weatherhj class of ships in existence) beiog " brought down " generally ruins them ; and the lighter tbey are tbe better. The reasons are obvious, on an examination of their form. All will concur in what be says as to the imporunce of Light draught : but on tbis we cannot now enter. With very much that Lieut. S. doubtlessly has to say, we suspect that we should agree ; and bis letter was an interesting one. What we protest against is, "ot his theory, but tbe assumption that it is proved or supported, by the recent trials of the Eurydice. Whether bis theory be correct is quite a separate question.

FOUNDERING OF H.M.S. EURYDICE OFF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

FEARFUL LOSS OF LIFE.

PAINFUL EXCITEMENT THE TOWN AND DOCKYARD.

Since the memorable day in September, 187O, when H.M.S. Captain foundered off Cape Finisterre and when nearly all hands were drowned, no naval disaster has occurred of a nature so truly awful as that which it is our most painful duty to announce as having happened yesterday afternoon to H.M. training ship Eurydice, just as that ill-starred vessel was almost within sight of the harbour, where all on board were anxiously expecting the meeting of those the enforced separation from whom had been the chief cause of regret during the continuance of the voyage apparently so rapidly drawing to successful conclusion. The Eurydice was a training ship for youths of the rating of ordinary seamen, and every year it was the practice of the authorities to send her on deep sea cruise, for tha purpose of giving the young men forming her crew more thorough insight into their duties than any they could receive whilst quietly lying anchor in a land-locked harbour. Tho voyage from which she was returning had been made to the West Indies, and in addition to her crew, we have been informed that she had on board several time-expired men and invalids. We have telegraphed to London for a complete list, and trust to receive it in time for our third edition. So far as we have peon able to gather, she had favouring winds until she sighted the Lizard, and during her subsequent passage up the Channel until she arrived off the Isle of Wight on an afternoon so clear and pleasant as to resembla almost a summer day. However, about four o'clock the sun became obscured and the sky of a dull leaden colours, and a species of mist seemed to envelope the horizon. At the same it time began to snow, and the snow was accompanied with a biting wind of such strength (we had almost said ferosity) that people who a few minute* before had been walking and chatting gaily on the Southsea Common, were bent double by its force, whilst on the Portsdown Hill the dust was lifted and whirled towards the sky in masses resembling water-spouts. Into this storm of haze, and wind and snow, sailed the Eurydice, with every sail set, save and except her mizen-royal, and braced sharp on the port tack. She was seen no more !! A schooner, named the Emma, bound from Newcastle-on-Tyne to Poole, was also caught in the squall, but she weathered it successfully, and almost immediately the sun, we are told, came out again. The master of the schooner, on looking round, states that he saw wreckage, and thought that he heard cries, but there was no sign of the noble ship, which but a moment before had pursued her way proudly with all her studding sails set. Five men were rescued by those on board the Emma, and they were stripped, wrapped in blankets, rubbed, and received every possible attention ; but we much regret to say that three of them died on board, the other two, an A.B. named Benjamin Cuddiford, and a first-class boy, named Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, were removed to the Cottage Hospital Bonchurch, where they received every attention, and are considered by Dr. Williamson, of Veutnor, to be progressing favourably. The following is the account given Benjamin Cuddiford:

"The ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm about four o clock, when we were five miles from Dunnose.

"There were over 300 men on board, all of whom, except myself, and Fletcher, are, I believe, lost.

"I was one of the last on board the ship. Captain Hare was near me when she went down after capsizing, and she carried with her a large number of men who were clinging to her, who were drawn down in the vortex.

"A man near me said that a vessel was close by when the squall came on, and therefore we should be sure to be picked up. I was more than hour the water, being a first-rate swimmer, and very many of my comrades cried out for help. I tried to assist two or three, but at last there were four clinging me, and I was obliged to kick them off. We were well taken care of by the master the schooner and crew. Our ship left Bermuda three week's ago passed the Lizard yesterday, and expected to anchor at about five o'clock."

SCENE AT THE DOCKYARD GATES.

The scene at the dockyard gates this morning was harrowing in the extreme. The gates this time of the year are opened at seven o'clock, but long before that hour crowds of anxious relatives had assembled in the faint hope that the awful news which had spread through the town during the night might prove after all to be, if not unfounded, at any rate exaggerated ; but tnere was no such comfort for the poor bereaved ones. The officials at the entrance broke the news to them as gently they could, but the scene was one that would have made an impression even on the callous-hearted. Mothers waiting for their sons, bonnie boys just bursting into manhood, and wives who had reason to believe that their husbands were among the time-expired men several of whom it was known had taken passage home by the Eurydice, mourning, only those who are suddenly widowed, can.

RETURN GOVERNMENT TUG "MANLY" TO THE DOCKYARD.

So soon was the accident was reported to the Admiral steamers were sent to the locality; but up to four o'clock, when the tug Manly returned, no bodies had been recovered. A party of riggers who went out in the tug have commenced work, but the divers have not yet gone down.

[Press Association Telegram.]

Our Ventnor correspondent telegraphs that the weather was beautifully fine yesterday afternoon, and every rope of the Eurydice could be distinguished about a mile off. With alarming suddenness a gale set in from the north-west, and surprise was expressed by old salts that the Eurydice did not shorten sail, she having even her standing-sails set. The thick weather concealed her when passing Dunnose Head, and when the weather cleared she was not to be seen. The schooner Emma, of Newcastle, was observed to be lowering boats, only five, however, were rescued. Medical aid was obtained from shore, but three of them were so exhausted that they died shortly afterwards. Two— Cuddiford and Fletcher,— were removed to the College Hospital and soon recovered. Fletcher states that he was below with the greater part of the crew, when, hearing a noise, he rushed up the hatchway aud heard the cry, "All hands for themselves." He caught life buoy, and jumped overboard, as did the others who were picked up. A minute afterwards the ship gave a lurch forward and sank drawing him down a considerable distance, but the life buoy raised him again. The vessel now lies two miles off Luccombe chine. Several gunboats are cruising round the spot, and attempts will be made to raise her. There is some hope that the barque seen near the spot may saved others.

NAMES OF THE PASSENGERS.

We have received a telegram from the Admiralty informing us that the names of the passengers are not known, but that we shall be informed of their ratings, and these, together with later particulars, we hope publish in our subsequent editions.

The following account was received by one of our reporters from an official connected with one of the tugs, which returned from the wreck in the early morning :—

Her Majesty's training-ship Eurydice, commanded by Captain Marcus Hare, capsized about half-past four yesterday afternoon off Dunnose, Isle of Wight. She left Bermuda on the afternoon of the 6th inst. with between three hundred and three hundred and sixty men on board, and was expected here in few days. At four o'clock yesterday afternoon, she was seen by the schooner Emma standing the eastward under all plain sail and courses. She was then braced sharp up on the port tack. A snow storm with heavy squalls then came on, and she lost sight her. At a quarter to five, on the weather clearing a little, the Eurydice was nowhere to be seen. A punt, with five men in it, was perceived, and the schooner immediately bore down upon them and took them on board. Three of them, including the First Lieutenant (Francis H. Tabor), have since died. The other two, named Benjamin Cuddiford, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, have recovered, and are now being well taken care of the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch. Cuddiford states that the ship was caught in a squall and capsized about five miles off Dunnose about four o'clock. He was standing close to Captain Hare when the ship went down, sucking many with it. He was about an hour in the water, and tried to save others who clung to him but in order to save himself he was at last obliged to kick them off. The sad news was immediately telegraphed to Admiral Fanshawe, commander-in-chief, who at once sent steamers to search the vicinity, but they found no trace of any other survivors, and it is feared that all hands, with the exception of Cuddiford and Fletcher, are lost. The ship is lying in about twelve fathoms of water, and at low tide her lower yards are above water. The foretop-gallant mast, and the main royal mast are both gone. The mizen royal is the only sail furled. A party of fifty riggers and several divers proceeded to the spot this morning. The Dromedary is to lay by the wreck ait light ship.

In reference to this sad catastrophe the following was received at the Admiralty last night:–

"J. G. Livesey, Ventnor, the Right Hon. W. H. Smith, M.P., Admiralty, London"

"Her Majesty's training-ship Eurydice capsized in a sudden squall, off Dunnose, at half-past four this afternoon, and went down at once.

"The Emma (schooner), passing, picked up five men, but some have since died.

"Cuddicome (?) first-class boy, and Fletcher saved. Tabor, First Lieutenant, very doubtful. Military Engineer officer drowned.

"Ship was commissioned at Portsmouth Feb. 7, 1877, and ordered to the West Indies. Was now bound for Spithead. Was observed passing Ventnor a few minutes before the catastrophe with all sails set. Snowstorm then came on very suddenly, with ery heavy gusts of wind. Probably no more saved than schooner picked up, as a strong ebb tide was running.

"Sun came out brilliantly directly after squall, but nothing could be seen from shore at Ventnor but few large boxes brought down Channel. Certainly no boat.

"Schooner detained by Capt. Roche, R.N., Inspecting Commander St. Catherine Division Coast Guard, who went on board immediately with Ventnor doctor, and has telegraphed to Admiral at Portsmouth to send steamer round,

"Admiral Fanshawe to Admiralty.

"Have just received the following from Coast Guard, Ventnor : 'Eurydice capsized off Dunnose. Cuddicombe, first-class boy, and Fletcher saved; Tabor, first lieutenant, very doubtful, military engineer officer drowned.' "

"Commander Coast Guard, Ventnor, to Admiralty,

"We have two men alive— Cuddiford, A.8., and Fletcher, first-class boy— and the dead bodies of Lieuteuant Tabor, Colonel Ferrier, R.E., and one able seaman."

The Eurydice was a wooden training ship for ordinary seamen and boys, a vessel of 921 tons. She is thus described in the Navy List :

Eurydice, guns, sixth rate.  
Captain—Marcus A. S. Hare, Feb. 7, 1877.

THE LOSS OF H.M.S. "EURYDICE."

Mr. Goschen asked if the First Lord the Admiralty had any further information in reference to the sad disaster—the loss of the Eurydice– which had spread through the country such deep and universal sorrow. (Hear, hear.)

Mr. Smith was sorry he had not much information beyond what had already appeared in the Press. The disaster was a most mournful one, for the ship was returning after a successful and useful cruise, and the squall by which she was overtaken was so sudden and violent that she went down without notice. Admiral Fanshawe, in a late telegram, reported that everything bad drifted towards the French coast, and no bodies had been recovered. It appeared that when the disaster occurred the men were in the act of shortening sail. The two men recovered were in Bonchurch Cottage Hospital, and it was hoped they would be well enough to be in London, to-morrow. The officers on board the Eurydice were specially selected for efficiency. He expressed the deep sorrow the Admiralty felt at the disaster— the greatest since the loss of the Captain. (Hear, hear.)

FOUNDERING OF H.M.& EURYDICE.

We have received the following sad news from the Admiralty:– "The Admiralty have received the following telegram from Admiral Fanshawe, Commander-In-Chief Portsmouth: — 'Have just received the following from Coastguard, Ventnor:— 'Eurydice capsized off Dunnose. Cuddicome, First-class Boy, and Fletcher saved. Tabor, First Lieutenant, very doubtful. Steamer going Immediately'

"A further telegram states that she capsized in a sudden squall at half-past 4 this (Sunday) afternoon. A subsequent telegram states that Lieutenant Tabor and Colonel Ferrler, Royal Engineers, are dead. The Eurydice was commissioned by Captain Hare, in February, 1877, as a training-ship for second-class Ordinary Seamen, and she was returning to Spithead after a winter’s cruise in the West Indies. The Admiral Commanding-in-Chief at Portsmouth has sent steamers to search the vicinity of the accident, but no further report has been received.  
Admiralty, Sunday, 11 30 p.m.”

VENTNOR, Sunday Evening.  
Her Majesty’s training-ship Eurydice capsized in a sudden squall off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, at half-post 4 o’clock this afternoon, and went down at once. The schooner Emma, which was passing, picked up five men. but some of these have since died. Cuddicombe, a First-class Boy, and Fletcher were saved, and Tabor, the First Lieutenant, but it is very doubtful whether he will recover. The military Engineer officer was drowned. The ship was commissioned at Portsmouth on the of February, 1877, and was ordered to the West Indies. She was now bound for Spithead, and was observed passing Ventnor few minutes before the catastrophe with all sail set. A snowstorm then came on very suddenly with very heavy gusts of wind. Probably no more men have been saved than those picked up by the schooner, as a strong ebb tide was running. The sun came out brilliantly directly after the squall, but nothing could be seen from the shore Ventnor except a few large boxes being swept down the Channel, and certainly no boats. The schooner has been detained by Captain Roche, R.N., Inspecting Commander, St. Catherine's Division of the Coastguard, who went on board immediately with Ventnor doctors, and has telegraphed to the Admiral at Portsmouth to send round a steamer.

Later.  
Lieutenant Tabor is dead, and his body has been brought ashore, so that the only survivors, so far as known, are Benjamin Cuddicombe, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, First-class Boy, aged 19. Cuddicombe states that the ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm five miles of Dunnose, about 4 o’clock. More than 300 men were on board, all of whom, he believes, are lost except himself and Fletcher. Cuddicombe was among the last on the ship. Captain Hare was near him when the ship went down, suclkng many with it. Cuddicombe and man near him said that vessel was close by when the squall came on, and, therefore, they would be sure to picked up. He was over an hour the water. Being a first-rate swimmer, every one called out to him for help. He tried to assist two or three, but last four clung to him, and he was obliged to kick them off. Was well taken care of the Master of the schooner and Crew. The ship left Bermuda three weeks ago, passed the Lizard yesterday, and expected to anchor at Spithead about 5 o’clock.

These two men are well provided for at the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch, and are under the care of Dr. Williamson, of Ventnor, who considers them to be doing fairly well.

The Eurydice was a training-ship for Ordinary Seamen, and is officially described as sixth rate. She was under the command of Captain Marcus Hare. Having left Bermuda on her return trip as recently as the 6th inst., she was not expected to reach Portsmouth for some days. Her consorts, the Martin and the Liberty, have arrived—the former at Portsmouth, and the latter at Plymouth.

The following list of Officers board is given in the *Navy List* .—Captain Marcus A. S. Hare. Lieutenants : Francis H. Tabor, Charles Y. Strange, William E. Black, Stanley A. Burney.

THE GALE AND SNOW STORM

During the gale which passed over the metropolis so suddenly on Sunday afternoon, several boats were swamped in the upper part of the Thames and loss of life resulted.

The weather in South Shropshire is intensely cold, and tbe hilly district has been visited with fitful storms of snow. Thee tops of the lofty eminences of the Loag-mynd, the Carodoc Range, and the Clee Hills, are all capped with snow.

During a snowstorm which raged off the Scotch cosst at Stranraer on Sunday the schooner Ellipse, with coals, from Greenock for Isly, was totally lost about ten miles from Stranraer. Two of the crew, by name M'Millan and M'Neill, were drowned.

On Sunday afternoon, while the wind was blowng hard from the north, a schooner, which afterwards proved to be the Heroine, of Dartmouth, bound from Lydney to Fremington with a cargo of coals, was seen running for the harbour at Appledore, in Devon, when sha was caught by some dense snow squalls which completely enveloped her. On their clearing away she was found to have been driven on the South Tail Bank, where she was surrounded by broken water. The Appledore No. 1 life-boat of the National Life-boat Institution was launched with all despatch, and was fortunately enabled to save the crew of the vessel, which is likely to become a total wreck.

The screw-steamer Eagle, of Neath, while making for Hayle Harbour, in Cornwall, on Sunday, during a stroug N.E. wind, grounded on the bar, and the heavy seas breaking over her carried away her screw, rudder, and stern poet. The Oxford University life-boat Isis, belonging to the National Life-boat Institution, and stationed at this place, promptly proceeded to her and remained by her for an hour, until it was considered the lives of the crew were no longer in danger.

On Sunday morning, during a strong wind from the north, a vessel ran ashore on the Goodwin Sands. Tha Broadstairs life-boat of the National Life-boat Institution and tbe Ramsgate Harbour steamer Vulcan and life-boat Bradford proceeded to her assistance, and after some hours' exertion they were successful in getting the disabled vessel off the sands and into harbour. She was the brigantine Florida, of Christiania, bound from Frederikstadt to Granville, with a cargo of coal, and had on board a crew of seven men.

On Sunday evening, during a heavy gale from the north, accompanied by snow showers, the schooner Velocity, of Nefyn, bound there from Silloth, exhibited signals of distress in Porthdinllaen Bay, North Wales, and in response thereto the National life-boat George Moore was launched, and succeeded in rescuing ths crew, whom she landed in safety. This life-boat was placed there about six months since, its expense being defrayed from a fund raised amongst the *employés* of Messrs. Copt stake, Hughes, Crampton, aud Co. (lat. Mtssrs. Copestake, Moore, and Co.), to provide a life-boat to be called the George Moore in memory of their late respected employer, the well-known philanthropist.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

From Our Own Correspondent, Ventnor, Monday

Finding that the two poor fellows who had such a narrow escape from the sinking of the ill-fated Government training-ship Eurydice were sufficiently convalescent to admit of an interview, I spent a short time with them in their bed-room this morning, and elicited a few facts from them concerning tha terrible catastrophe. These poor fellows, Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher, did not appear to be very communicative, but thay exhibited no particular studied desire to withhold any facts. Cuddiford, a powerful-looking man, about 35, was second captain on the quarterdeck, and belongs to Plymouth. Fletcher is a youth about 20 years of age, and was qualifying as seaman. From Cuddiford's statement, which was confirmed by Fletcher, it appears that the Eurydice left Bermuda on the 6th instant, having on board ber full complement o officers and men, with about 300 men and boys in training for her Majesty's navy. There were also Colonel Ferrier aud five other officers of the Royal Engineers on board, with Colonel Ferrier's servant. They had a fine voyage homeward, with the exception of one day's rough sea. As they passed Bonchurch and Ventnor shortly after mid-day the vessel was in full sail, and there appeared not the slightest premonitory indication of the awful event. Part of the men and boys were below deck at the time, and some of them were asleep in their berths, having gone off duty at noon. At the moment of the catastrophe they were thrown bodily from their sleeping postures, and as they rushed to the gangways they were met by the sea and carried below with the ill-fated vessel. There were others firmly locked in the cells below deck, and several were in irons for various misdemeanours. There were six of these prisoners on board, being transferred to Portsmouth — four from her Majesty's ship Rover, which was in the company of the Eurydice on the West Indian station, one from the brig Martin, and one from the Bermuda dockyard. After passing Bonchurch the ship was sailing apparently in safety, when a sudden squall from the W.N.W. caught hold of her canvas, and, with the aid of an immense sea which broke upon the port side of the hull, she was quickly thrown on her beam ends. The captain was at his post, and instantly gave orders to take in the lower studding-sail, which Cuddiford, who was on deck at the time, seized hold of and let go, hastening afterwards to the side of the captain at the stern of the vessel. Other men had been ordered aloft, and were in the act of taking in the royals when the ship sank, carrying all hands with her. There were only four guns on board, bnt they were all fast, and did not seem to move from tbe port holes. She was what the seamen call a "stiff"' vessel, and the hands considered her safe, particularly in regard to the unlooked-for casualty of capsizing. When she heeled over a rush was made for the starboard boat, but they were unable to clear her from her davits and she was stove in ; but as to the boat to windward, that was lifted so high in the air aa to be out of all reach, and it was useless to attempt to utilise it. It had been a beautiful day, and the port doors had been unsuspectingly left open, and when the vessel heeled over the sea rushed into these open ports like a torrent, and the hands on deck plunged into the sea as the craft went down. The captain bravely remained on the deck till nearly every man who was on the upper deck had jumped overboard, and so far as the survivors could remember he went down with the ship. Suddenly thrown into the raging sea, the seamen struggled and cried for assistance, but there was none to help. Tha two men who were saved are good swimmers, aad they say they were in the water about an hour. They could see the cliffs as the snowstorm cleared away, and they struggled hard to reach the shore, but all their efforts proved ineffectual. They were on the verge of despair, when, to make bad worse, they saw to their horror an immense sea rushing towards them and threatening speedy destruction. In their last hope they turned upon the coming wave and in terror awaited their fate. As if by a miracle they found themselves again on the surface of the water. After this swell had spent itself, and again looking round, they discovered a short distance away a schooner which had weathered the terrible storm. By this time they were almost exhausted, but they took fresh courage from the sight of the schooner, which was bound for Poole, and raised their hands as a signal of distress. When hauled on board they became unconscious, but recovered before they were landed at Ventnor.

From other sources it seems that the schooner made signals to the shore, while on board they were doing all they could to restore the poor sea-men, having also picked up Colonel Ferrier, Lieutenant Tabor, and an able seaman who has not get been identified, but is supposed to be named Bennett. All were alive when picked up by the schooner— the Emma, of Poole— but the two officers and the unknown seaman had expired before they reached the shore at Ventnor, whither they were taken by a Deal lugger, which had been chartered by the coaatguards and taken off to the Emma by Chief-officer Clark, of the Ventnor station. Lieutenant Tabor was found clinging to a locker which had been washed from the foundered ship.

Cuddiford and Fletcher left Ventnor by the 2.10 train this afternoon for Portsmouth, there to undergo an examination by the Admiral of the Port. The Eurydice is now lying, it is thought, on a ledge, drifted there by the rough sea. She stands with a slight list, but at low water several feet of her upper masts are observable with the topsails furled. During the day two Government tugs have been at the scene of the wreck.

FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT. PORTSMOUTH. MONDAY.

There is as yet very little to add to the sad account of the loss of life in the Eurydice. The two sailors, Cuddiford and Fletcher, who are as yet known to be the only survivors, have been brought to the dockyard and have been seen by the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Fanshawe, and other officials. Two sets of divers were sent out this morning to the wreck, but up to 7 p.m. there is no information of any bodies having been found, although as in all such cases there are various reports and opinions expressed.

The master of the schooner Emma, who picked up the survivors, states that he was proceeding down Channel, and being below in his berth he was hurriedly called on deck by the mate in charge and told there were signs of a heavy gale coming on. On reaching the deck he immediately gave orders to guard against the evidently impending danger by taking in all the sail he had set. The mate then told the master that a short time previous he saw a man of war ahead, but new she was nowhere to be seen, and on nearing the spot where she was last seen he saw the men he had picked up floating about, but did not see any other bodies. He states that the gale and snowstorm was the most violent he ever witnessased, as it came to its height almost suddennly.

The schoomer and her crew have been detained by order of the Commander-in-Chief, in case the eNvdence of the men should be required at any court of inquiry that may hereafter be hold. The sad calamity has caused a heavy gloom to spread over the place and neighbourhood, where so many of the relatives of the unfortunate officers and crew reside.

Her Majesty sent a telegram to-day to the Commander-in-Chief for all particulars, and to express her grief at the sad occurrence.

PORTSMOUTH, MONDAY EVENING

A steamer has just come in from the scene of the wreck, but no bodies have been found. Divers have been down, but they could not penetrate to the lower deck. All the sails are set. Thy wreck is not more than a mile and a half from the shore.

TELEGRAMS FROM THE QUEEN.

The following telegrem has bean received at Portsea from General Ponsonby at Windsor:-

"The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further parlculars."

In accordance with the Royal request all available intelligence was transmitted to the Queen.

The following telegram from the Queen to the First Lord of the Admiralty. dated Windsor, 4.5 p.m., was received at the Admiralty is the early part of last evening:—

"The Queen would ask Mr. Smith to intake known her grief at the terrible calamity of the Eurydice, and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted parents and relatives."

The subjoined particulars of the deplorable event are gleaned from various sources :—

Captain Somerset, the senior officer at Bermuda, in a letter of the 6th inst., reports that the Eurydice arrived on 25th February from Antigua, and sailed 6th March for Portsmouth. She had on board, besides her own otficera and crew, one ship's corporal, nine marines and time-expired men, six military time-expired men, two naval invalids, and three court-martial prisoners. The names of these men are not yet known.

Captain Hare, who commanded the Euydice, and Lieutenant Tabor, the first lieutenant, were firat-rate seamen and were selected by the late Mr. Ward Hunt especially for their good qualities in this respect. The cruise had been a most successful one.

When the Eurydice, on February 14, parted cornpsny with the training-briga Martin and Liberty, which arrived home last Thursday, the Eurydice was proceeding to Antigua to refit. During the voyage, several ordinary seamen were promoted by Captain Hare to the rank. of A.B.'s.

A telegram from Ventnor on Monday morning says:— "The sudden capsizing of her Majesty's ship Eurydice yesterday afternoon, and the lose of some 313 live, has cast a gloom over our little town, and this morning broke without revealing any speck on the wide expanses of water giving hope of further lives saved. The only two known surivors— Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher—are progressing favourably, and are quite as will as could be expected after such a prolonged immersion on such a wintry day. The masts of the ill-fated frigate are now visible about two miles from shore, off Lucombe. As there was a strong ebb tide at the time of the disaster and a strong north wind blowing no bodies are likely to wash ashore here. The Eurydice passed Ventnor at 3.15 with a heavy press of sail, and this attracted considtrable attention and admiration. Within half an hour from that time the weather, which bad been bright, suddenly changed, and a strong gust having caught the sails caused her at once to capsize and sink. But for the schooner Emma passing at the time nothing would have been known of the disaster, as for fully half an hour every object was obscurod by a blinding snowstorm, and it would have been thought that the ship had gone on safely to Spithead."

At Portsmouth yesterday morning, on the loss of the Eurydice becoming known, a large number of relatives and friends of the men on board flocked to the dockyard to obtain information. Nothing, however, was made known beyond the bare announcement of the disaster posted on the dockyard gates. One of the tugs which started for the scene of the casualty on Sunday night returned yesterday and took out a large party of shipwrights and riggers and the diving apparatus. The crew of the tug report that at low water her lower yards are just visible above water. She appears to have been in full sail when caught in the squall, and the only sail failed, as far as can at present be ascertained, was the main royal. According to competent opinion ths Eurydice was backed sharp upon the port tack when seized by the squall. The foretopgallant mast and the main royal are broken off, andthis may be taken as indicative of the strength and severity of the squall.

A correspondent, telegraphing from Ventnor yesterday morning, says— "It was a sudden squall from land which upset the Eurydice whilst taking in sail. She immediately heeled over on her beam. All the boats were swept away. She was going at the rate of 15 miles an hour. Some men jumped overboard, but nearly all stuck to the ship, and the captain remained till the last. The ship rapidly filled with water, and in a few minutes went down head foremost. Cuddiford thinks that many were killed instantaneously at the time the sheip heeled over. He jumped overboard himself just before the ship went down. Looking around him he could only see about 30 come to the surface, amongst them being the two doctors, who were both swimming. The first lieutenant, Mr. Tabor, and a captain of the Royal Engineers had seized hold of a wash-deck locker. For some time after Cuddiford had taken hold of the buoy he could not see land. He estimates the time they were in the water at about one hour and 20 minutes. Fletcher, the other survivor, hailed him and they were making for the shore when they were picked op by the schooner Emma, whose atention they attracted by raising their hands and shouting out. There were 30 passengers on board, seven members of the ROyal Engineers, six prisoners, one in irons, the others in cells. Fletcher was saved by fortunately picking up a cork life-belt from the ship's life-boat. Benjamin Cuddiford is an able seaman and Sidney Hatcher an ordinary seaman. Fletcher was on the watch below decks. When he found the ship heeling over he rushed on deck, and found the ship's gunwale under water. A violent squall and snowstorm prevailed at the time of the wreck. 1Lieutenant Tabor was picked up alive, but died on the schooner Emma. The captain of Engineers was picked up dead. This narrative is obtained from the survivors this morning."

A telegram from Portstmouth at noon yesterday says: —"The excitement here is intense, and many unfounded rumours are circulatiog. One statement has been spread to the effect that the captain and two midshipmen of the Eurydice had been picked up alive, but no such tidings have been received at the Admiralty offices, and the report is therefere discredited. The admiral and the captain of the Steam Reserve have gone to the wreck, and a despatch-boat has just been sent from the flag-ship with provisions for the working party at the wreck. By all nautical men the Eurydice was looked upon as one of the finest sailing frigates in the service, and the feeling among them is one of universal surprise at such a catastrophe having overtaken her. She was at one time commanded by Admiral Sir George Elliot, who was remarkably well pleased with her. The relatives of the officers and crew continue to  present themselves in large numbers at the Admiralty offices here seeking for Information. In some cases a wife or a mother has been sent to the scene of the disater, so as to be near at hand in case of any others being rescued alive or their remains recovered. Hopes are still entertained that some of the crew may yet be heard of as having been washed ashore elsewhere or picked up in the Channel. The severity of the weather on Sunday, however, renders this theory extremely improbable. The Government steamers continue to cruise round in hopes of gaining some tidings. The inquest on the remains of the four men picked up has not yet been fixed."

The indications are that her sails were not blown away by the squall, and the consequently she was laid on her beam-ends, and it is surmised that the ports being open she immediately filled and sank. The Eurydice being a fine statch ship, it is believed there wil be no difficulty in raising her. She was a fully rigged ship. She was a wooden ship of 921 tons. She is ths described in the Navy List:-

OFF THE ISLE OF WIGHT. 300 OR 400 LIVES LOST.

Her Majesty's training ship Eurydice, returning from a cruise to the West Indies with a crew of young seamen, capsized on Sunday afternoon, about four o'clock, during a heavy snowstorm, and sudden and tremendously heavy squall, about live miles off Dunnose. A schooner picked up five of the crew, but two soon died. and another— Tabor, the first lieutenant, soon followed. The remainder of the officers and crew, said to be between and 300 and 400 in all, were drowned. Dunnose is a headland near the centre of the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight, between Shanklin and Sandown. The two men saved are Benjamin Cuddeford. first-class seaman, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, a first-class boy, of Bristol, aged 19. Cuddeford was among the last on the ship. Captain Marcus Hare, he says, was near him when the ship went down, sucking many with her. A man near him said a vessel was close by when the squall came up, and, therefore, they would be sure to be picked up. He was over an hour in the water. Being a first-rate swimmer everyone called to him for help. He tried to assist two or three, but at last four clung to him, and he was obliged to kick them off. He was well taken care of by the master of the schooner and the crew. The ship left Bermuda three weeks ago. She passed the Lizard on Sunay, and expected to anchor at Spithead about five o'clock. These two men were well provided for at the Cottage Hospital. Bonchurch, and placed under the care of Dr. Williamson, of Ventnor.

The Eurydice, a sailing vessel of 921 tons burden, was commissioned in Portsmouth in 1877, as a training ship for second-class ordinary seamen, and sent to the Barbadoes station. Most of the unfortunate young men are believed to belong to Portsmouth. Two tugs were sent from Portsmouth as soon as the sad news reached Admiral Fanshawe.

The circumstances are similar in many respects to those attending the loss of the Captain, both ships having turned over and sunk during a gale of wind, all their sail being at the time set. So far as can be ascertained the Eurydice had 368 souls on board at the time, though this is very much a mater of conjecture, as, besides her own offciers and crew, she was bringing home a number of military offciers, supernumeraries, and invalids from the West Indies. Hence considerable uncertainty exists as to the names and numbers of the sufferers. The Eurydice was a wooden sailing, fully-rigged ship of 921 tons displarsimeat, and was at one time considered one the smartest and quickest 26 gun frigates in the service. She was built about 1843. Last year she was converted into a training ship for ordinary seamen at Mr. John White's yard at Cowes, and was completed for sea at Portsmouth Dockyard. oShe was commissioned on the 7th of February, 1877, and finally sailed from Portsmouth on the 13th of November with a crew of about 300 ordinary seamen and the officers named below. All the officers and crew are lost, with the exception of two seamen. Captain Hare had been at one time commander of the St. Vincent, training-ship at Portsmouth, and was selected for the command from his knowledge and experience of young seamen. Lieutenant Tabor was a thoroughly efficient sailor, having had command of the Cruiser in the Mediterranean. The Eurydice was accompanied from Portsmouth by the training brig Martin, and was eventually joined at Madeira by the Liberty from Plymouth. All the vessels were filled with ordinary seamen, whom it was considered necessary to inure to the sea by a long cruise ; and, as they were all draughted from the home training-ships, the distress caused by their loss is spread over the whole country. They were, of course, mostly unmarried men, and in this respect the crew differ from that of the Captain, who were principally able-bodied seamen and petty officers. The Liberty arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago, the Eurydice being detained for the purpose of taking up supernumeraries. Captain Hare, however, informed Lieutenant-Commander Hicks that he expected to be home almost as soon as the Martin.

Cuddeford made the following statement to the Admiralty authorities:–

"At 7 bells on Sunday afternoon, the 24th inst., the watch at a quarter to 4 o'clock was called to take in lower studding-sails. I was on deck to tend the lower tack, and let it go. The captain gave orders to take in the upper sails. The wind was then freshening. The captain ordered the men to come down from aloft, and then to let go the topsail halliards. The gunner's mate let go the topsail halliards, and another man, Bryans, let go the mainsheets. The water was then running over the lee netting on the starboard aide, and washed away the cutter. The foretopmast studding-sail was set. The wind was about a point abaft the port beam. I caught hold of the main trues, fell, and caught hold of the weathernetting, and got on the ship's side. We could see her keel. She righted a little before going down, bringing the mizzen topsail out of the water. She then went gradually over from forward, the greater part of the hands being at the fore part of the ship outside. She then turned over, bringing the port cutter bottom upwards. I and another, Richards, cut the foremost gripe, and then saw the captain standing on the vessel's side near the quarter boat and the two doctors struggling in the water. I swam some distance, keeping over my head a lifebuoy, which I found, and then picked up some piece of wreck, which I gave to some of the men in the water. I then came across the copper punt full of water, five men were in it. The sea capsized the punt, and they all got on the bottom. They asked me if there was any signs of help. I told them the best thing they could do was to keep their spirits up. One of them was just letting go his hold of the punt. I do not know his name. I next saw Mr. Brewer, the boatswain, with a cork lifebelt on. He was struggling strongly. I then saw Fletcher in the water with a cork belt and breaker. I lost sight of him during the snow. About five minutes afterwards the weather cleared up. I saw Fletcher again and we kept together. Then we saw land, but, finding it too rough, we turned our backs to the land and saw a schooner. The schooner bore down on us, sent a boat, and picked up two offciers that I had not previously noticed with a wash-deck locker. A rope's end was thrown to me from the schooner, and I was then picked up. I judge that I was in the water one hour and 20 minutes. The officers picked up were Lieutenant Tabor and a captain of the Royal Engineers who came on board at Bermuda with one corporal, one bombardier, four privates, and a servant of an officer of the Royal Engineers. The ship capsized about 10 minutes to 4. The captain was giving orders at the time, and was carrying out his duty. We rounded on the weather beam, and set the lower studding-sail at 2p.m. The ship was then going 8 1/2 knots. I don't know who was the officer of the watch as the captain was carrying on the duty. The Hon Mr. Giffard went to the wheel to help at the time the water was coming over the lee nettines in consequence of an order being given to put the helm up. There were the following supernumeraries on board:— Three Court-martial prisoners from the Rover; one A. B., a Court-martial prisoner from Bermuda; an ordinary seaman named Parker, who bad been tried by Court-martial (he belonged to the Eurydice) ; and about 12 or 14 Marines, with one sergeant of Marines from Bermuda Dockyard, two invalids from Bermuda Hospital, one ships' corporal from the Argus, one captain's cook from the Argus, one engineer's steward from the Argus, one ship's cook from Bermuda Dockyard, one quartermaster, named Nicholas, from the Rover. I believe some of the maindeck ports were open to let in the air to the maindeck mess. I don't think the hands were turned up; there was hardly time for that. I saw most of the men forward take off their clothes and jump off before I lost sight of them in the squall. When the snow cleared up the ship was gone down."

THE INQUEST

Was opened ar the Queen's Hotel, the Esplanade, Ventnor, at one o'clock yesterday, by ? Blake, Esq., coroner for the Isle Wight, and a jury of which  W. Mew Judd was foreman. —The inquest was on the bodies of Lieut. Franics Hope Tabor, Capt. Louis Ferrier, and – Bennett.

The Coroner said that before opening he must express his deep concoern— in which he was sure they all shared, and every one who had heard of the sad occurrence which had called them together— which had resulted in the loss of a large number of valuable lives, when they were really almost in reach and sight of their destination. It was a very important eqnquiry. Although they were only nominally inquiring into the deaths of three persons, a hundred times that number had met their deaths from the same cause, and he was quite sure they would give this matter their meet serious attention, and he hoped the evidence would be such as to enable them to arrive at a satisfactory reason for this sad disaster.

After viewing the bodies the jury adjourned to the Royal Hotel.

Robt. Montague Tabor,of Carshalton, Surrey, deposed that he had seen the bodies. One was that of his brother—Francis Hope Tabor, a lieutenant in the navy. Last saw him alive five or six months ago, in Kent. He went to the West Indies, and was on his way home from Bermuda in the Eurydice. He expected him daily. Thought he would have been 30 in July.

Benjamin Cuddeford deposed that he was an able seaman. l'he bodies viewed were those of Lieut. Tabor, a man named Bennett, and a Captain of the Royal Engineers [Captain Ferrier] who took a passage home in the ship. Bennett was captain of the quarter deck. The Eurydice was a wooden sailing ship-4 guns. One trip before this she was employed as a training ship, and had been 13 months' in commission. Lately she had been all round the West India Islands, witness being aboard her. Her captain was Capt. Marcus Hare. They left Bermuda on the 6th March for Portsmoutb. There were over 300 persons aboard, including supernumeraries. The greater part of the crew were ordinary seamen. There were about 30 ship's company—attached to the ship. On Sunday they were about two hours' sail from Spithead just before 2 p.m.—off the Isle of Wight. They set the lower studdingsail. They had all plain sail set before--all except the topgallant studdingsails. The weather was then very fine. There was just a moderate breeze, just abaft the beam. Between 3.30 and 4 o'clock the captain called the port watch to take in the lower studdingsal. The wind was coming on. Ihe sail was taken in. Then the Captain gave orders for the Royal yardmen aloft to take in the Royals. They were not taken in. The captain ordered the men down at once, and sail let go the mainsheet and topsail halyards. That was for the men's safety —the squad just caught them then. He believed the royals were lowered but not furled. The Captain gave orders to let go the maintopsail halyard and main sheet. That was done. The ship was pretty near on her beam ends. Heard the captain say "If you can't let it go cut it." The men on the lee were up to their waist in water then. He expected it must have been the foresheet. Witness was on the quarter deck at the time. He then crawled up the quarter deck netting over the ship's side, and saw all the sails in the water. He got up to get on the weather side of the ship. He could then see the ship's keel, and her sails were in the water. She righted a few feet, and he saw her mizzen topsail come out of the water. Then he looked forward and saw the ship sinking from forward taking a lot of men with her who were outside the ship. The water gradually increased aft, and just as it got in a line with the mainmast she turned right over, and the port cutter was bottom upwards. Ihe ship's keel was right out of water. He stuck to the ship. The captain gave orders to try and get the port cutter clear. He and another man went, and they got one gripe clear by cutting it with a knife. Then the water encroached. The captain was just behind him at the side of the ship. Richards, who was assisting him (witness), was swept away, and he saw him no more. The cutter was not got clear. He jumped overboard and passed the two doctors drowning, but could not give them any assistance. Many others were in the water then. Witness swam to a round life buoy, and took some pieces of wreck— wood and spars— going to the assistance of others. The captain was still on the vessel when witness jumped over, and the vessel went down almost immediately afterwards. He saw six men on the bottom of a boat. They asked if there was any hopes, and he said the best thing was to keep their spirits up. One let go with the cold. Of those on the bottom of the boat were Mason, Martin, another cook's mate being brought home. The others were ordinary seamen ; he didn't know their names. He saw Mr. Brewer, boatswain, with a lifebelt. He believed the cook's mate had been left behind from the Tamar. Fletcher was close to him, and when the mist cleared they saw land and made for it till they were picked up. Thought he was swimming about an hour and 20 minutes. Fletcher, an ordinary seaman, was also picked up by the schooner. He (witness) caught hold of the rope's end they chucked at him, but turned dizzy afterwards.— A violent snowstorm came on. They were not tacking at the time. The squall came on between 3.30 and 4. They could not see that the storm was coming on: he could not see—he was at work. He didn't see land at all—he didn't go above the netting to see—that was about 2ft above his head. The ports were open on each side. The sub. lieutenant, the Hon. – Gifford, went to assist at the wheel— five men were at the wheel, and the sub-lieutenant at the weather wheel. The helm was put up after they tried to take in the Royal. They did their best to put the helm up —couldn't say whether they did or not. The ports were 4 or 5ft. above the water when the ship was on even keel. The guns did not shift. There was one watch below deck— about 150, and all the supernumeraries— when the first order was given to shorten sail. Some were lying down asleep, and some writing. She had 10 ports and two small ones— all on the upper deck. When the first order was given to shorten sail no order was given to those below —it was not an order to all hands. 150 in the watch on deck was sufficient for shortening sail. When the squall commenced—when the captain saw it coming, he gave the order to shorten sail. Witness experienced most snow in the water than he did before. The officer of the watch was Sub-Lieut. Randolph. He was forward assisting in taking in the lower studdingsail.

By Mr. Tabor: The captain gave the order to set the lower studdingsail.

By others: We run in the weather braces, then set the lower studdingsail. The captain said heave the log, and the reply was 8 knots. That was about 2 o'clock. The main deck being very close, they had the ports open. It was quite usual on such an afternoon as Sunday afternoon, to have the porta open. Didn't see Capt. Hare after he (witness) jumped over. The ship went down about five minutes after she was on her beam ends. There was no time to lower boats—the lower starboard boat was swamped away. The galley was smashed. On Sunday the rule is to pipe down. Saw the captain on deck before it began to look dirty. There was a life buoy on each side the bridle, and one on each bow of the launch, forward, and one right astern. There were only five on deck. There were about twelve life belts. These were in one of the launches, having been moved the day before for painting.

By Mr. Harvey (representing the Admiralty): Directly the captain observed the squall coming, he immediately ordered the taking in of the lower studdingsail— the largest sail in the ship. This was done. The men were in the act of lowering the Royals, when the captain gave the order, Let go the maintopsail halyards and main sheet. In the act of going up, and before doing this, they were ordered down. He supposed the captain was afraid the top?allantmast and royal mast would be carried away. He supposed it was for their safety. There were two cutters—port and starboard. It took 10 to man one, and 12 another, besides coxswains. There would be a life belt for each man in each cutter. The rule was to keep one life belt for each cutter.Three life belts were packed up. The squall came all of a sudden, and she went on her beam ends immediately. It was a sudden gust— almost say it gave no warning. As one of the ship's company, he didn't expect that any such thing would take place. He had been on her 13 months. It was very fine weather just before —nice steady breeze. He thought everything was done that could be done, both to save the vessel and the men's lives. She behaved very well in a gale is the Bay of Biscay going out. All the time witness wait on deck, the Capain and Lieut. Tabor were there. The Engineer Captain was there too. Considered the captain and officers thorough seamen. Had been 21 years in the navy. During that time he sever saw a squall come so quickly. Sundays was a quiet day, and Thursday afternoons was for mending clothes— if fine weather. Thought 150 hands enough to save the vessel, if anything more could have been done. There was no time to do anything. If she had been braced sharp up, it would have taken all hands. If the whole company had been on deck, they would have been in one another's way. Didn't think the least blame attached to any of the officers.

By jurors: When thrown on her beam ends, he thought only a few would have any chance of getting up on deck. When the main sheet was let go, and topsail halyards, it had no effect.

Captain George Henry Ferrier deposed that he belonged to the 105th Light Infantry, now quartered at Colchester. He recognised one of the bodies as that of his brother, Captain Louis John George Ferrier, quartered in Bermuda. He appeared to have come home on leave in the Eurydice. Had not heard that he was coming home. Didn't know whether he had any duty aboard. He was now in his 38th year.

Sydney Fletcher deposed that he was 19 years of age. He was a first-class ordinary seaman aboard the Eurydice. He came in her from Bermuda, having been aboard six months. Last Sunday afternoon he was below between 12 and 4. He was getting his tea to come on at eight bells, when he heard a rush of water on the main deck—in through the ports. She had been going very steady. Just before he heard the water, he found she gave a lurch. He lowered the half port and ran on deck. The water was coming in over her lee netting, and he assisted another man in overhauling the foretopsail halyards. He got over the weather netting, and walked on the ship's side —right aft on the quarter. She was right on her side— he walked below her ports. As soon as he got aft he saw the keel of the ship right out of water. It was blowing hard and snowing, and the sea was breaking right over the ship. He believed the main yard touched the water. Saw the captain standing on the quarter— giving orders. They could not cut the after gripe of the cutter, as it was too late— she was under water. He picked up a life belt, and got away from the ship about 30 yards. She was then nearly under water. The captain was on the side, and Mr. Edmunds, sub-lieutenant, took off his coat and jumped over. Didn't see him after. Saw Mr. Tabor with no cap on. Saw him on a wash-deck locker in the sea. Witness was saved by a life belt, which fell out of one of the cutters. When he saw a schooner yards off he felt so full of joy he didn't know what to do. Bennett had been floating by him. Was in the water an hour and twenty minutes before he was picked up. Then he was insensible. Before the ship lurched he had not noticed the wind blowing harder. His mess was right against the fore hatchway. Didn't think that of the whole watch more than two besides himself got up. Many tried to do so—he heard them making a row, crying and screaming. He was close to the hatchway, and that was how he escaped. He saw Mr. Brewer in the water. Didn't see a great many others. Couldn't say how long the snow storm lasted. It snowed when he jumped off. He got within about half a mile of and then saw the schooner. Should think there were 26 or 38 life belts aboard. The greater part were kept in the pinnaces—boomboat. On ordinary occasions the belts could be easily got at—when the ship was sailing.

By Jurors: Did not see the ship go down. Belioved there was only one man below in irons. Water was partly her ballast.

By the Coroner: This water, being consumed during the voyage, would become lighter towards the close. Could not say what water was left on Sunday. Neither stores nor guns had shifted.

By Mr. Tabor: When he got on deck all was confusion. Lieut. Tabor was in his shirt sleeves. Didn't know whether he was mistaken, as he was picked up with his uniform coat on—he might have been.

By Mr. Harvey : The heeling over and the rushing in of water were instantaneous. lie heard the captain giving the orders, and the men would have got out the cutter if they could. It had been fine up to the very minute, and they were sailing along as they had been all day. Didn't know what the ballast of the ship really consisted of. He knew some ballast was iron. He always understood that the water was taken in for ballast as well as for drink. He didn't understand this as regarded every ship. He had been told on board that water was partly her ballast. Was not sure she had iron ballast. He said partly water, meaning the other part stores. Had never been down to see. Didn't know anything about her ballast —only water. He overhauled the halyards for about two minutes before he got up and out on the side. Thought the ship went down in 7 or 8 minutes after she was struck. All had a chance of getting the life belts in the pinnace —not after she heeled over.

By a Juror: The captain's order was as the port cutter. Could not see the other.

Cuddleford (recalled) by Jurors, said the Eurydice had proper ballast for her tonnage– the lower tier of tanks was never disturbed. She was more lively when they ran rather short. If she gave a cant she would throw you off your legs. Never heard during the voyage that any ballast had shifted. If it had shifted, hands would have had to put it right. She went down with her masts on one side—under water. The mizzenmast showed out of water. There was no chance getting to it.—Didn't know the state of the barometer. Had there been a sudden change by 8 in the morning he should have heard.

William Langworthy Jenkin deposed that he was master the schooner "Emma " of Padstow. On Sunday he was proceeding from Newcastle to Poole. lie encountered a sudden squall about ten minutes past four. He was off Dunnose. Yes he had warning. It looked rather bad to windward before the squall came on. He hauled down the flying jibs, maintopmast staysail, gaff topsail, lowered the mainsail away, the gallant and topsail halyards, boom jib and fore staysail. He afterwards lowered the foresail down. They had only the standing jib set properly. They did it during the squall, which he supposed lasted half-an-hour. Supposed he was four or five miles from land when the squall took them. He saw it approaching. It rose very black. There was a fall of snow too. Didn't see the Eurydice before she went down. After the snow cleared away he saw something floating on the water. He sent a man in the rigging to see what it was. Another man reported he fancied he saw a man in the water. He set the mainsail &c., and went right towards what was floating. They heard cries in the water. They found five men in the water- well on for a quarter of a mile apart from one another. They were all insensible when on deck and very much exhausted. The five were Cuddeford and Fletcher and the three bodies viewed. He got them in the cabin, and stripped them and rubbed them and then came on to Ventner. Should think it was three or four miles from land where he picked them up. They would not take any stimulant. Cuddeford and Fletcher had some coffee. The others could not take anything. A boat came off and he sent ashore for a doctor, and two came. One man was dead when picked up—Bennett. Lieut. Tabor had his uniform on. Two others died aboard. Thought it was only a boat's crew when he picked up the men. Had not seen the Eurydice. His schooner was 137 tons register. The crew was six hands all told. He was laden with coals— light cargo. The wind was W.N.W., should think a vessel 4 or 5 miles from shore would have a better chance of seeing it than one a mile or mile and a-half. He didn't make much preparation till the squall struck. He had no stimulants aboard. Those who died were too far gone to take it if they could have had it.

By Jurors: Saw a barque after the squall. Only saw the five men in the water—no wreckage. The tide was running strongly to the westward. There was no sign of the Eurydice. They couldn't see any more. They didn't sail about. Three had belts on, one a lifebuoy and another a box. Couldn't see the length of the vessel when the snow fell. It took him 30 minutes to take his sails in and it was pretty well over then. They didn't take in any sail till they felt the first weight of the wind. He didn't think it was going to be near so heavy. Had often experienced a stronger squall—perhaps not a more sudden one. A squall might strike with different force and effect on two objects within half a mile of each other.

James Mann Williamson deposed that he was a Doctor of Medicine. On Sunday afternoon he went aboard the schooner. He found three persons in the cabin. Coddeford was half dressed. He was sensible, but apparently suffering from shock, and the other two were apparently dead. Dr. Martin arrived there before, and had been using every means to restore animation in Lieut. Tabor. He attempted to restore animation to the body of as. Ferrier. Did not discover any signs of life. - Dr. Martin thought Lieut. Tabor's head pulsated very slightly, but witness could not feel that. Bennett was dead. He believed all died from drowning. Froth exuded from Mr. Tabor's mouth.

George Parkinson, able seaman, deposed that he was aboard the schooner on Sunday afternoon. He saw the Eurydice before the storm came on—about ten minutes before. She was going up, and they down channel. All the sail was on the Eurydice so far as he could see. When he first saw her, he didn't consider she had too much sail for her safety. After the squall came on, he could not see anything– and he never saw the ship again :didnlt look for her. He saw it coming up black but didn't think it was going to be anything, as it was so long coming. Never saw anything so heavy, after being so long rising. There was only a moderate breeze while he saw the Eurydice. She was about a mile from land. Witness' vessel was four or five. They didn't lower sails till the squall struck.

By Mr. Harvey : He was surprised to hear of the loss of the Eurydice, though he was in the same squall. Had experienced a deal heavier ones. Had seen a squall act more on one vessel than another, when near— had seen one dismantled and not the other. Looking at the weather before the squall, he didn't think the Eurydice had too much canvas. The squall would strike the Eurydice first.

Sgt. Ransom produced the watch which be received from Dr. Martin, who attended Capt. Ferrier. It stopped at eight minutes to four.

Mr. E. J. Harvey (who is the Admiralty Law Agent for Portsmouth) called John Flynn, a commissiosed boatman in the Coastguard, of Ventnor, who produced photographs of a storm which passed over Cowes a year or two ago. The "Globe" was destroyed, and the next house escaped. He produced a photograph to show that it had cut like a knige thriugh some trees in a Copse near Cowes. It showed that a squall at sea would strike one vessel and not another—he had seen that himself. In the Chinese seas he had seen junks blow over, and others not touched.

The Coroner (the above being all the evidence) then summed up the several depositions to the jury –reminding them of the most important points. He said he did not think it necessary to offer many observations, the facts were so short and simple. It seldom happened that in a disaster of this magnitude the facts were so simple and clear. It was not a case of collision where there might be a conflict of evidence as to the cause at the collision, as to whether it it might have been occasioned by want of a sufficient look-out or observation of the rules of the road of the sea, or any similar cause. It was not a case of a vessel striking on a rock, which might or might not be due to any want of care or skill on the part of the person navigating the vessel The question in this case was whether the parties responsible for the safety of this vessel did observe or did not observe that care, caution, and skill, which it was imperative upon them to exercise upon the occasion. It seemed to him that the questions for them to consider were— was the capsizong of this unfortunate ship owing either to her carrying too much sail, and if not whether there was sufficient promptitude on the part of the commander in lowering the sails when he saw that a storm was upon him. Another question which bad been incidentally mentioned, was whether it might have been due in any measure to any want of sufficient ballast. There did not appear to be anything to suggest that there was any danger in the sails which the ship was carrying before she was struck. Cuddeford said the weather was fine and there was a moderate breeze, but be was not on deck to observe whether a storm was approaching, or not. The seaman of the Emma didn't observe anything dangerous or unusal  in the quantity of sail. The next question was— did the Captain use all promptitude and care in giving orders, and were those orders obeyed as far as they could be in taking down the sails. If they believed the evidenee, and there was no reason to doubt it, the Captain did exercise care and promptitude, and remained on the vessel till she went down. If so, there would be no blame attaching to any person.– After alluding to the question of ballast, the Coroner said the Eurydice being much nearer the shore, her captain would not be likely to observe the storm coming so soon as the master of the schooner. He thought the jury could only arrive at the conclusion that it was an accidental circumstance.

The Jury retired and were absent nearly an hour. On their return, the foreman announced that they unanimously found "that Louis J. C. Ferrier, Francis Hope Tabor, and – Bennett, were accidentally drowned, owing to the capsizing of H.M.S. Eurydice, by a sudden squall off Dunnose on Sunday the 24th inst., and the Jury consider from the evidence adduced, that no blame whatever can be attached to the captain, officers, or men of the ship.

There is something of a personal sorrow which must affect every Englishman when he reads a narrative of this kind. We are all proud of the quality of our seamen, and of the courage with which they expose themselves to a life of constant peril. We cannot but mourn over the untimely loss of so many brave and promising fellows. The disaster is intensified in poignancy by the circumstances under which it happaned. Death of one's native land, after a long separation from near and dear friends, is a terrible thing. The joyous hope, the buoyant expectation, the thrill of delight with which the shores of Old England fill the home-coming sailors are changed into the wild cry of despair and wail of drowning men. On such a picture we have no morbid fancy for dwelling. It will haunt, during these coming weeks, many an English home. In scores of cottages hearts have beat high with hope, the simple preparations of affection have been made, and parents have counted the hours till they should clasp their stalwart sailor-lads in their arms once more. And now the desolation of death has turned their joy into a terrible sorrow. The cruel, merciless sea has robbed them of the bright boys of whom they were so proud. England shares their sorrow. If it be any consolation to the bereaved relatives of those who have gone down in the Eurydice, they may be sure that not an English heart beats but does not sympathise with them in their great sorrow, and deeply deplore the calamity which has robbed the country of more than 300 of her brave defenders.

CAPSIZING oF H.M.S. "EURYDICE"  
OVER 300 LIVES LOST.

On Sunday afrernoon, one of the most sudden and terrific snow squalls whica we ever remember at tnis time of the year, passed over Ryde, making tne waters in the Solent rise in white-capped breakers in a wonderfully short space of time and those who witnessed its effects on the waters think of the "poor souls at sea." Although accidents were anticipated, the imagination of no one compassed such a terrible event as that which then occurred at the back of the Wight. In the course of the evening it was whispered, with bated breath, that one of Her Majesty's ships had been overset off Ventnor, and the dreadful rumour was, of course, treated at first as a canard. Its correctness was, however, subsequentiy verifed, and the excitement which reigned may be easily imagined, more especially on the following morning, when the news of the sad disaster was spread abroad far and wide. At Ventnor, however, the excitement was most intense. On Sunday afternoon the weather wss comparatively fine and miid, and there were more than tne usual number of visitors on the esplanade. About 4 o'clock all eyes were turned to a pleasant sight. Close to the shore, and easily distinguished, was H.M.S. Eurydice, which was bowling along uuder a press of canvas, with a stiff breeze, at a fine rate. Soon, however, the sky be- came overcast, and it became evident that a storm wa-s coming on, and the vessel was watched by the "old salts" with some interest. As they noted tne storm gathering, their verdict was "that fellow will soon have to shorten sail." The snow storm which came on, however, soon drove the promenaders to their homes, and hid the ship from all, and she was not seen again. The sudden squall caught her off Dunnose, and she Was overturned in a moment, and went down with over 300 men. Only five of these were picked up. The schooner Emma, which was passing, picked up five men — Lieutenant Tabor, Captain Ferrier, R.E., Bennett, Cuddiford, and Fletcher, a first-class boy, but the first three of these died before reaching the shore. The ship was commissioned at Portsmouth uu the 7th of February, 1877, and was ordered to the West Indies. She was now bound for Spithead. Cuddiford states that the ship capsized in a squall and snow storm, five mils off Dunnose, about 4 o' clock. More than 3OO men were on board, all of whom, he believes, are lost, excepting himself and Fletcher. Cuddiford was amongst the iast on the ship. Captain Hare was with him when the ship went down, sucking many with it. Cuddiford and a man near him said that a vessel was close by when the squall came on, and, therefore, they would be sure to be picked up. He was over an hour in the water, and, being a good swimmer, every one called out to him for help. He tried to assist two or three, but at last four clung to him, and he was obdged to kick tnem off. He was well taken care of by tne master and crew of the schooner. The ship left Bermuda three weeks ago, passed the Lizaid on Sunday, and was expected to anchor at Spithead about, 5 o'clock.

The following list of officers on board is given in the *Navy List*: Captain, Marcus A. S. Hare; Lieuteuants, Francis H. Tabor. Charles Y. Strange, William E. Black, Stanley A Burney; Staff-surgeon, James L. Whitney; Paymaster, Frank Pittman; Sub-Lieutenants, the Hon. Edward R. Gifford, Herbert S. Edmonds, Walter S. Smith, Sidney G. Randolph ; Surgeon, Robert Murdoch, M. B. ; gunner, Frederick Aden ; boatswains, William Brewer, Joseph Warren ; assistant clerk, William Lamont.

FURTHER PARTICULARS

The Eurydice was a wooden sailing, fully-rigged ship of 921 tons displacement, and was at one time considered one of tne smartest and quickest 26 gun frigates in the service. She was built about 1843. Last year she was conveted into a training-ship for orainary seamen at Mr John White's yard at Cowes, and was completed for sea at Portsmouth dockyard. She was commissioned on the 7th of February, 1877, and finally sailed from Portsmouth on the 13th of November with a crew of about 390 ordinary seamen and the officers named above. All the officers and crew are lost, with the exception of two seamen. Captain Hare had been at one time commander of the St. Vincent, training-ship at Portsmouth, and was selected for the command from his knowledge and experience of young seamen. Lieutenant Tabor was a thorougnly efficient sailor, having had command of ihe Cruizer in ihe Mediterranean. The Eurydice Was aocompnied foom Portsmouth by the training- brig Martin, and was eventually joined at Madeira by the Liberty from Plymouth. All the vessels were filled with ordinary seamen, whom it was considered necessary to inure to the sea by a long cruise ; and, as they were all draughted from the home training-snips, the distress caused by their loss is spread over the whole country. They were, of course, mostly unmarried men, and in this respect the crew differ irom that of the Captain, who were principally able-bodied seamen and petty officers. Tne Liberty arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago, the Eurydice being detained for the purpose of taking up supernumeraries. Captain Hare, however, intormed Lieutenant Commander Hicks that he expected to be home almost as soon as the Martin.

THE VOYAGE FROM BERMUDA.

The Euryuice left Bermuda on ihe 6th inst., and nothing was heard uf her until she was seen by tne Coastguard at Bonchurch at 3.30 on Sunday afternoon, bearing for Spithead under all piain sail, and with her port stunsails set on the foretopmast and maintopmast, the object being clearly to arrive at the anchorage at Spithead before nightfall. There was an ominous stillness prevailing at this time. A heavy bank of clouds was coming down from the north-west, aud the glass was falling rapidly. Such wind as there was from the westward, and blew on the port quarter of the ship, The Isle of Wight is of peculiar formation on its southern fringe, having wh it may be considered as a double caast-iiue, extending from Blackgang Chine as far as Shanklin. The inner circle of the Downs reaches a height of 500 feet above the sea, and affords a deceptive shelter to ships well inshore. From the direction in which the Eurydice was steering she would be n comparatively smooth water, so sheltered would she be by the Lowns, until she rounded Dunnose Point, where the disaster occurred. This circumstance will also serve to explain the fact that the schooner Emma, which was near at the time, was not affected by the gale. At 10 minutes to 4 the wind suddenly veered round from the west to the eastward, and a gale, accompanied by a blinding fall of snow, came rushing from the high lands down Luccombe Chine, sinking the Eurydice just a little before the beam, driving her out of her course, which was heading to the north-east, and turning her bows to the east. This is what seems probable, thougn, from the manner in which the sea was concealed by the snow, nothing was seen of her at the supreme moment when she capsized to starboard. The air cleared as suddenly as it became overcast, the wind sinking away at the same time. As soon as anything could be seen, the masts aud top-hamper ot the snip were discerned above the water about 2 3/4 miles E.N.E. off Dunnose - a well-known and lofty landmark between Shanklin and Ventnor. The ship lies in 11 fathoms of water, and from her position she appears to have righted in going down.

RESCUE OF THE SURVIVORS.

Capt. Langworthy Jenkin, master of the Emma, schooner, bound from Newcastle for Poole with coals, was the means of rescuing the survivors, and has brought his ship into Portstmouth to give particulars. He states that at 45 minutes past 4 on Sunday afteruoon, after a heavy squall, the atmosphere cleared, and he observed sume wreckage and the royais of a ship flappiug above the water. He also fancied he heard some one shouting for assistance. He sent a man into the rigging to look out, who reported that he saw a man floating ln the water with a cork jacket. He immediately made sail and stood towards him. Having to tack once to fetch him, he hoisted out boats, which picked up four mem, and one man was picked up from the ship. He did his best to restore their circulation, but one of the men had died before he was got on board. Capt. Jenkins then stood for Ventnor with colours half-mast high, and a boat came off. A doctor was sent for, but two other men died before he arrived. The Coastguard boat afterwards came alongside with Commander Roach, who recognised the body of Lieut. Tabor, the first lieutenant of the Eurydice, and the other as an officer of the Royal Engineers. When the men were picked up, Dunnose bore N.W. by W. three to four miles.

TELEGRAMS FROM THE QUEEN.

During Monday the Commander-in-Chief was in constant communication with Her Majesty and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and in the course of the day received the following telegrams from the Queen. The first, which came from Her Majesty, was in the following terms: 

"The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further details."

The second was transmitted to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and was to the following effect :

"The Queen would ask Mr Smith to make kunwn her grief at the terrible calamity to the Eurydice and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted friends and relatives."

In another telegram to Mr Smith the Queen said the telegrams had caused us the greatest grief. These telegrams, having been forwarded to Admiral Fanshawe, were promptly posted at the dockyard gates, where they were eagerly read by sympathetic crowds.

THE INQUEST.

The inquest upon the bodies of Lieutenant Francis Hope Tabor, Captain Louis Ferrier, R E , and David Bennett, ordinary seaman, was held on Tuesday afternoon by F. Blake, Esq. coroner, who commenced the proceedings at the Queen's Hotel, Esplanade, Venrnor. The bodies were in a little outhouse near the hotel, and had already been coffined. That of Captain Ferrier especially bore a calm and peaceful expression, betokening that death had been sudden and painless. The white cloths with which they had been covered were sprinkled with beautiful fiowers. As soon as the Coroner, jury, and representatives of the Press had assembled at the Queen's Hotel it was at once perceived that the room placed at their disposal was a great deal too small, and the Coroner asked if a larger room could not be procured. The Freemasons' Tavern was at first suggested, but eventually the proprietor of the Royal Hotel offered the use of a larger room there, and after the jury, of whom Mr. W. M Judd was foreman, had been sworn aud had viewed the body, they adjourned to the Royal Hotel. In opening the proceedings,

The Coroner said he could not forbear expressing his deep concern, which he was sure everybody must share, at the cause which had called them together — an accident which had resulted in the loss of so many valuable lives when they had almost arrived at their destination. This was a most important enquiry, for, though the present inquest was nominally only as to the death of three persons, a hundred times that number had died from the same accident. He asked them to give this evidence their best attention.

The first witness called was,

Robert Montague Tabor, who deposed — I live at Carshorton, Surrey. I have ,seen the bodies which have been viewed by the jury, and identify one of them as that of my brother, Francis Hope Tabor, a lieutenant in the Navy. I last saw him alive about five or six months ago, in Kent. He had since been to the West Indies. He was first lieutenant on board the Eurydice, and was coming home in her. We were expecting him daily. I think he would have been 30 in July.

Benjamin Cuddiford deposed - I am an able sea-man. I have seen the bodies which have been viewed by the coroner and jury, and identify them as those of Lieut. Tabor, a man named Bennett (I don't know his Christian name), and the other is a captain in the Engineers, who took a passage in the ship. I knew him by signt, but did not know his name. Lieut. Tabor was first lieuteuant on board the Eurydice, and I was able seaman on board the same ship. Bennett was captain of the quarter deck. The captain in the Engineers had only taken a passage on board, and was not doing duty. The Eurydice was a wooden sailing ship, and had been employed as a training ship, and had been 13 months in commission. She had lately been over to the West India Islands. I had been on board her all the 13 months. She was cruising out the West India Islands all the winter. Lieut. Tabor was commanding officer. Capt. Hare was on board. We left Bermuda on the 6th of March, for Portsmouth. We had over 300 officers and men ou board. That included supernumaries. I cannot say for certain exactly how many there were. The crew were mostly ordinary seamen. The ship's company was about 30 altogether. Tne others left at the end of the voyage. On Sunday, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the ship was off the Isle of Wight, we set the lower tunsail. We had all plain salts set betore that. We had all sails set except topgallant stunsail. The weather was then very fine, and there was a moderate wind just abaft the beam. Between half-past 3 and 4 o'clock they called the lower watch to take in the lower stunsail, the weather looking dirty to windward. It was just coming on to blow tnen. The sail was taken in, and tnen orders were given to take in the royals. The squall caught us before the royals were taken in, and ihe captain ordered the men down for their own safety. The royals were then lowered, but not furled. Then the captain gave orders to let go the maintopsail halyards and main sheet. That was done, and the next order the captain gave was, "If you cau't let it go, cut it." Tne ship was tnen on her beam ends, aud the water up to the men's waists, but I don't know to what the order referred. I was on the quarter deck netting. I got there to get on the Weather side of the ship. I could then see her keel, and her sails were in the water. She righted again in a few feet, and I saw her mizentopsail come out of the wateer. I then saw the ship sinking from forwards, taking down with her a body of men which were on her bottom. The water began to increase aft, and just as the water got abreast of the mainmast the snip turned right over, and her keel was out of water. I stuck to tbe ship. The captain gave orders to get the cutter clear, aud we had got one rope clear by cutting it with a knife, but the water encroached upon us. The captain was about six or seven feet from me. A man by the name of Richardson, who was assisting me, was swept away. The cutter was not got clear. I then jumped overboard and passed two doctors drowning, but couid render them no assistance. There were many others in the water. I swam to a round life-buoy, and then went to the assistance of others with pieces of wood and spars. The captain was on the vessel when I jumped overboard, and the vessel must have gone down immediately afterwards. I called one or two men I knew, aud let them have spars, &c. I saw six men clinging to a boat. They asked me if I thougnt there was any hope. I said, "the best thing they could do was keep tneir spirits up." One of them let go with the cold. I knew some of their names. There was Mason, Martin, and a cook's mate taking his passage home. Tne other three were ordinary seamen, and I do not know their names. I saw Mr Brewer, the boatswain, with a life-buoy. I believe the cook's mate was from the Tamar I turned my back to the squall when it came on, and the oher man (Fletcher) was near me. I tnink I swam about for an hour and 20 minutes before I was picked up by the schooner. Fletcher, an ordinary seaman, was also picked up. I did not see any others picked up. I was sensible when I was picked up, but felt giddy, and staggered when I got on the schooner's deck. It came on a sudden gust, which caught the vessel.

By the Jury.— We were not tacking at the time the squall struck the ship. The squall came on between half-past 3 and 4 o clock. I was on deck but went down and had a basin of tea. We could not see that it was coming on. I did not see any land any time all the afternoon. I did not go above the netting to see it. My work kept me from seeing anything else. The ropes I had to attend to were close to the deck. The ports were open. The squall caught us from the same direction as wee were going. They tried to put up the helm. There were five men at the helm. Tne Hon Gifford was there. I can't say whether they did put it up. Tne ports, when the ship was on an even keel, were about 5ft, above the water. The guns were well secured. There might be one watch below when the order was first given to shorten sail. There were about 150 men and supernumeraies below. There was no order given for all hands to shorten sail. It is not usual to call all hands. The watch on deck were quite sufficient to shorten sail. The captain gave tne order to shorten sail when he saw the squall coming. It was about 4 o'clock when I jumped overooard. Sub-Lieut Randolph was officer of the watch. I could not remember yesterday.

By Mr. Tabor.— I don't know whether the captain was on deck all the afternoon. He gave orders to heave the lead at 2 o'clock, and the reply was "eight knots and a half"

By the Jury.— It is usual, under such circumstances as on Sunday afternoon, to have the ports open. I did not see any more of Capt Hare after I jumped. There was no time given to lower boats. She has four quarter boats. The galley was smashed and no good. I can't say whether the captain was on deck when the weather began to look dirty. There were life-buoys on each side of the bridge, one on each side of the launch, and one astern— five altogether. There were 12 life-belts, which were on deck. The life-buoys floated when the ship went over.

By Mr Harvey.- Directly the captain saw the squall coming he ordered the stansail to be taken in. This was the largest sail in the ship. The captain also gave orders to let go the maintopsail half yards and mainsheet, and the men were in the act of doing this whn ordered down. That was done for fear the masts would give way and the men be sent into the sea. There were two cutters– port and starboard. It takes 13 men to man one, and 11 the other. There would have been a life-belt for each man on board each cutter That was the regulation ; but the cutters were bottom up ward, and I could not say whether the belts were there or not. I know three life-belts have been picked up. It was a sudden gust which sent the ship over. It came without giving any warning. As one of the ship's company, I did not expect that any such thing would take place.

Capt George Henry Ferrier, of the 105th Light Infantry, stationed at Colchester, identified one of the bodies seen by the Coroner and Jury as that of his late brother, Capt. Louis George Ferrier, of the Royal Engineers, stationed at Bermuda, who was taking passage home on leave in the Eurydice. he had no idea that his brother was coming home in the ship until the previous afternoon, when he received a telegram. The deceased was in the 38th year of age.

Sydney Fletcher stated that he was just turned 19 years of age and was a first-class ordinary seaman on board the Eurydice. He came in the Eurydice from Bermuda. He had only been in her during the last trip. He had been on board during the past six mouths. On Sunday afternoon last he was below from 12 o'clock at noon till 4 o'clock. At the latter hour he was getting his tea, in order to be in readiness to go on watch at eight bells, when he heard a rush of water coming through the port. Just before he found the water come in, the ship had given a lurch. He lowered the half port, and then ran on deck and let go the topsail halyard. At that time the water was coming in over her lee nettings. He assisted another man in overhauling the fore top-sail halyards. He then got over the weather nettings and walked right aft on the side of thn ship. She was right on her side at that time. He walked below her ports. When he got aft of the quarter he could see the keel of the ship out of water. It was blowing hard and snowing at the time. The sea was breaking over her and the main yard was touching the water. He saw the Captain standing on the quarter-deck giving orders to clear the cutter. The foremost gripe was cut, but the after one could not be cut, as it was too late, the ship at this time sinking fast. He picked up a life belt that had fallen out of one of the cutters, about 30 yards away from the ship. He could not see much of the ship at that time, as she was very nearly under water. Mr. Edmunds, a Sub-Lieutenant. took off his coat and jumped overboard, but witness could not tell what became of him afterwards. He saw Mr. Tabor standing with his coat off and no cap on. He afterwards saw him clinging to a wash deck locker. He did not see anything at all of Capt. Ferrier during the afternoon, but he understood that he was picked up from off the wash deck locker. He saw Bennett, the captain of the quarter-deck, and Mr. Brewer, the warrant officer, floating past him. He thought he must have been in tne water an hour and twent minutes when he was picked up by the schooner. He (witness) was sensible when he was picked up. Before he found the ship lurch he did not know that the wind was blowing any harder than before. He did not believe there were any more than two others beside himself wno succeeded in getting on the upper deck. They were all crying out and screaming. He was close to the hatchway when the lurch came, and that was how he came to get up on to the upper deck. After ihe ship went down, he saw Mr Brewer floating about, and asked him in what direction he thought the land was. He could not say how long the snow continued to fall but when it cleared away he saw the land, and thought he was about half-a-mile from it. He did not see any other men floating about. When the snow cleared away he saw the schooner standing towards him as he was making for the shore.

By the Foreman : I did not see the ship go down.

A Juror: Were there any men below in irons? — I believe there was one.

By the Coroner : I cannot say whether the wind was bowing off the land or not. I had no reason for noticing.

A Juror: Had you a sufficient quantity of ballast on board?— A great portion of our ballast was water.

The Coroner : Which was being consumed during the voyage ? — Yes 

Do you kuow whether there waa a large quantity of water in her on Sunday afternoon before this happened ?— No, I cannot tell.

The Foreman : You had not been put on shor allowance of water ?— No. 

The Coroner: Were the guns or stores displaced previously ? —No ; not that I kuow of.

Mr. R. R Tabor: Don't you think you might have been mistaken in recognising my brother ? You say he was in his shirt sleeves when you saw him, and yet when he was picked up he had on his uniform coat. — I might have beeu mistaken.

By Mr. Harvey : I had not much opportunity of seeing what was going on after I came up, but I heard the Captain giviug his orders. Up to the very minute of the lurch and the rush of warer the weather had been fine.

Mr. Harvey : Do you really know whether the water formed a part of the ballast ? — I know that we had water on board, and I always understood that it was partly carried as ballast. I have been told on board that her ballast was partly water. I do not know of my own knowledge that we had any concrete and iron on board as ballast.

Do you realy know anything of your own knowledge as to her ballast ? No, except that I have always heard chat her ballast was partl water.

You were below at the time of ihe lurch ? — Yes.

And you cannot say what orders were given on deck until you came up ?— No.

The Coroner : I will re-call the witness Cuddiford and ask him a few questions as to the ballast. He will know more than ihis witness.

The witness Cuddiford was re-called and questioned by one of the jurors, Mr. Henry Owen.

What ballast had the Eurydice on board at the time of the accideut ? — She had her proper ballast for the tonnage of the vessel.

What is this about the water being reckoned as ballast ? — She had two tier of tanks, and the lower tier were never touched or disturbe in any way.

Had she sufficient ballast without the water? — She had sufficient ballast in her without reckoning the water or her stores, but when the water or the stores became light, tne vessel, of course, sailed lighter, and became more lively, and when she gave lurches, as she often used to do, she would knock us off our feet to leeward.

She had the reputation of being a lively vessel, had she not ? —No ; I did not know that she had.

the lower tier of tanks being full of water, and never touched, would add to her ballast as a matter ot course? — Yes, of course it would.

At any time during the period you have been on board the Eurydice have you ever heard anything said about her ballast having been shifted or inter- fered with in any way ? — No.

Has it been slutted ? -No. Had it been shifted I must have known it.

Aud had it shifted hands would you have been employed to put it right again ? — Yes.

The Foreman. —You say she was on her side and then righted ? — Yes, but still she went down on her side.

The Coroner.— So that the fact of her righting herself for a short time did not make any difference ? —No; her mizenmast stood out of water as she went down.

Then it was only what may be termed a temporary righting ? - That was all.

Do you kuow what the state of the barometer was just nefore the occurrence— I mean during the day or two before ? —I do not know. Dr. Murdoch used to take the readings of the barometer every morning at 8 o'clock. He took them every day since we have been in commission.

Did you hear of any sudden fall having takeii place in the baromoter ? -No. Had there been any fall when tne barometer was read at 8 o'clock on Sunday morning I must have known of it, for I wasworking close by where Dr. Murdoch took the readings. Every day at 2 o'clock the Navigating Lieutenant used to put up a card on the main deck showing the distance we had run, and the latitude and longitude.

William Langworth Jenkin was called and examined. He said he was master of the schooner, Emma, of Padstow. On Suuday afternoon last he was proceeding from Newcastle to Poole. At about ten minutes past 4 o'clock, according to his watch, he encountered a sudden squall when off Dunnose.

The Coroner : Had you any warning of the squall's approach? -It looked rather bad to windward before it came on.

Did you notice any alteration in your sails in consequence?– Yes. We hauled down the flying jib, the main topmast staysail, and the gaff top-sail. We lowered away at the mainsail the top gallantsail, and looked after the various halyards. We afterwards lowered the foresail down.

What sails hod you then set? We only had the standing jib set properly.

Were you able to do this before the squall came on ? —No ; we did it in the squall.

How long did the squall last ? I suppose half-an-hour. We were from four to five miles from land when the squall struck us.

A Juror : There was no high land to prevent your seeing the approach of a storm ? – Well, sir, we saw it rising up very black to windward when we looked out.

Another Juror: Did you see anything of the Eurydice before she went down ?  – No.

The Coroner : Tell us what happened subsequently to the squall. — There was a lot of snow. and when it cleared away I saw something floating up in the water, and I sent a man up into the rigging to see if he could make out what it was. Another reported that he saw a man in the water. We set a reef mainsail, a fore staysail, and a topsail an went towards what we saw floating to windward off us. As we got nearer we heard cries from the water for help, and when we got up to the spot we found five men floating in the water.

Were they together ? — No. They were about a quarter of a mile apart I should say. We picked them all up. They were very much exhausted and I believe they were all insensible after we got them on deck. Those we picked up were the witnesses Cuddiford aud Fletcher and the bodies of Lieut. Tabor, Capt. Ferrir, and Bennett. We took them into the cabin, stripped them, rubbed them, and then proceeded on for Ventnor. I think it should have been from three or four miles from the land. I picked them up, but I cannot tell you the exact distance. Cuddiford and Fletcher took a little water, but the others could not take any. Aboat came off, and I sent on shore for a doctor. Two doctors came. I do not think all three of the deceased, whose bodies the Coroner and jury have viewed, were quite dead when they were received on board my vessel, but I think Bennett was dead when we picked him up. One of my men said he thought he heard one of them speak after he was got into the boat. Lieut. Tabor was wearing his uniform at the time.

Do you consider that the squall was sufficiently violent to capsize the Eurydice, she being under full sail? No; I should think not. I was surprised when I found the Eurydice had gone down. I thought it was a boat's crew I was pick ag up.

A Juror : What sort of a vessel is yours ? She is a schooner of 137 tons register. We have six hands all told. We were laden with coals and were short of about 10 tons of our full cargo. Wnen the squall struck us the wind was about W.N W. We did not have time to take in our sail before we were struck. We had more time to prepare for the squall than the Eurydice had, seeing that we were furiher out to sea, and consequently had more opportunities noticing the approach of a storm. In answer to further questions, the witness said he had no stimulants on board to administer to the persons he picked up, but supposing they had they had they would have been of no use, as the three deceased persons could not have partaken of them. After they had picked up the bodies they looked about, but could see no others. Three of the five were wearing swimmming belts; one was wearing a life-buoy, and another was clinging to a box. Witness had been 15 years at sea, and had known squalls stronger than this, but conld not say that he know them to come on more suddenly. He had n ver heard that the Dunnose had a reputation for sudden gusts of wind.

Dr James Mann Williamson deposed to going on board the schooner on Sunday afternoon, and, in conjunction with Dr. Morton, using every possible means for restoring the deceased. He attributed the death of the deceased to drowning.

George Parkinson, seaman on board thn Emma, deposed to seeing the Eurydice going up Chauuel as they were going down. All sail was n the Eurydice as far as he could see, but he did did think that she had too much on her when he saw her. He saw the squall coming, which was very sudden, however. There was only a moderate breeze when he saw her, and she was then about a mile from the shore, while they in the schooner were four or five miles away. They did not lower sails until the squall came. He had been in squalls far heavier than that, and was surprised when he heard that the Eurydice had not weathered it out.

By Mr Harvey. — He had known cases in which a squall had seriously injured one vessel, and had not affected, in the slightest degree, another, although close to it.

Police Sergeant Ransom, stationed at Ventnor, produced a gold watch which he found on the body of Capt. Ferrier, and it was found to have stopped at eight minutes to 4.

John Flynn, a commissioned boatman in the Coastguard service, was called by Mr. Harvey, and produced two photographs, showing the effects of a tornado which had visited the Island two years ago, by which the Globe Hotel was destroyed, while the house next door escaped injury. The photographs also showed the effects upon trees in the vicinity. The witness added that he had known cases, and particularly in the China seas, in whicn squalls nad capsized one junk and left the other totally uninjured.

This being all the evidence, the coroner proceeded to sum up. He said the first question for the jury was as to what the capsizing of the Eurydice was owing; whether it was due to her carrying too much sail, and, if not, whether there was sufficient promptitude on the part of the captaiu in lowering sails when he saw the storm upon him. The evidence went to show that there was not too nmch sail, aud that all possible promptitude had been used. As to whether the capsizing might have been owing to want of sufficient ballast, Cuddiford had proved that the ship had her proper ballast.

The jury then retired, and, after an absence of half-an-hour, returned with the following verdict:

"The jury unanimously find that the three deceased were accidentally drowned, owing to the capsizing of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice by a sudden squall, at Dunnose, on Suuday, the 24th inst., and the jury consider that from the evidence adduced no lame whatever can attach to the captain, officers, and men of the ship."

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

A meeting of naval officers and influential inhabitants of Portsmouth was held on Wednesday at the College in the Dockyard for the purpose of organizing a Eurydice Relief Committee. The sad occasion drew together a number of gentlemen who were formerly associated for the relief of the sufferers by the Thunderer explosion and whose offer of services for a similar purpose were heartily welcomed. Among the gentlemen present were Admiral Fanshawe, Rear-Admiral Foley, Admiral Raby, Captains Wilson, Herbert, Singer, Arthur, Kelly, Peile, and Henderson, the Mayor and ex-Mayor of Portsmouth,the Vicar of Portsmouth, Colonel Burnaby,Colonel Richards, Inspector-General Domville, Canon Doyle, Commanders Otley, Wilson, and Swinson, and Mr. Griffin, J.P. The chair was taken by Admiral Fanshawe, Commander-in-Chief.

The Chairman said he did not think it necessary to make many remarks in introducing the business of the meeeting, as absolutely all that was known with respect to the calamity which had befallen the *Eurydice* had been published in the pablic prints. They had met to give practical effect to the sympathy they felt for the famiies and relatives of the sufferers in their great distress.

Captain WILSON said that on Monday evening himself and a few other officers met together and formed a provisional committee. The names of these gentlemen were telegraphed up to Lord Charles Beresford, the commander of the Thunder, and were published in the *Mail*. By means of this provisional committee they were enabled to give the matter a start. The names of the committee were the Commander-in-Chief, Admral Foley, Captain Herbert, Captain Jones, Mr. Wise, Mr. Richards and himself. Invitations were then issued to all the ships and clubs, and one was sent to the Generals commanding, and notices were given in all the newspapers. The objects of the meeting were to take into connsideration the best mode of raising a relief fund, and, moreover to relieve the provisional committee of any further responsibility. The cashier and seeretary who had manage the affairs of the Thunderer's fund so ably came forward and aided the cdturuittee in this preliminary work, and Mr. Richarda was now acting as hon. treaseurer and Mr. Wise as hon. secretary. As the latter would have to work morning and night to carry on the business, they could not expect him to perform his duties quite gratuitously. After describing the progress of the business, Captain Wilson said the provisional committee had received subscriptions which had been placeg in the hands of the treasurer to the amount of—speaking roughly—about £270, which included a donation from the Commander-in-Chief of £25. They had been promised altogether about £390 more, which included £50 from the First Lord of Admiralty, £25 from Sir Massey Lopes, and £25 from Hon. Mr. Egerton. In addition to this they had already received about £11O from subscriptions on board the Thunderer, and from other ships £200 had been received, the *Exellent* giving the sum of £155. Thus there had been raised the large sum of £850 which, considering that hardly 72 hours had elapsed since the unfortunate catastophe had occurred, must be regarded as very handsome and satisfactory, and very much larger than had been raised when the meeting assembled there some ten days after the accident on board the Thunderer occurred. The services of Mr. Wise and of Mr. Richards had been secured, and the committee had the advantage of their great knowledge in the management of these matters. In the case of the Thunderer they were not able to strike the iron while it was hot, and in consequence a great deal of money that might have been obtained was lost. But now the gentlemen mentioned had taken this thing in hand, they knew how to pull all the wires; and, no doubt, if the meeting gave them authority they would within 48 hours have circulars and appeals all over England, and all the machinery at work for obtaining a satisfactory result. As far was at present known, there were but three officers and 28 men of the Eurydice who had wives and families, and there were 69 men who were the support of relatives, mothers or sisters. But, of course, that could not represent all the married petty officers and men. It was quite probable that a large number of thrm did not "allot" to their wives, and hence the committee had not yet received information as to all the cases. There were a captain of the Royal Engineers and six sappers and miners, and as these were all time expired, they were probably married. There was also a sergeant of Marines and 12 men from Bermuda, a large number of whom married. That was all he could tell the meeting.

The first resolution, which was moved by the CHAIRMAN and seconded by Captain Arthur was as follows:—

"The appalling accident to Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, whereby numerous families are rendered comparatively destitute through loss of the bread-winner, calls for the sympathy of all who hold that England should ever maintain her supremacy on the ocean, and this meeting pledges itself to use every endeavour to alleviate, as far as possible, the grievous loss sustained by the widows, orphans and relatives of those who, within sight of their homes, perished in the execution of their duty to their country."

Admiral Foley moved and Mr. James Griffin seconded:—

"That a certain number of gentlemen be elected to form a standing committee with power to add to their number, and to select a sub or managing committee."

This having been carried, a pwerful committee was formed consisting of the Admirals, Caaptain Wilson, the Mayor, and the principal gentelment present, together with Lord Charles Beresford, Mr. Sebastian Gassiot and others who were not abale to attend.

On the motion of Captain Kelly, seconded by Staff Commander Braddon, Mr. Richards, of the Dockyard, and Mr. Wise, both of whom belonged to the Thunderer Relief Fund Committee, were appointed treasurer and secretary, and the National and Provincial Bank, Portsea, was selected as the banker of the fund.

Mr. Pink, the ex-Mayor of Portsmouth, moved that a deputation wait upn the Lord Mayor of London and the City Companies to ask their assistance and co-operation. The resolution was seconded by the Vicar of Portsmouth, who, as a civilian, was anxious to state that the loss of the Eurydice was felt as much by the general public as by the Navy itself.

Inspector-General Domville moved, and Mr, Penfold, R.N., seconded, that the clergy and ministers of all denominations and the various clubs be appealed to for subscriptions; it was also agreed, on the motion of Commander Otely, seconded by Lieutenant Ackland, that circular letters be sent to all Her Majesty's ships, marine divisions, regiment dockyards, and naval hospitals.

A vote of thanks having been accorded to Admiral Fanshawe for presiding, on the motion of the Mayorof Portsmouth and Liietenant-Colonel Galt, the proceedings terminated. In addition to the sums mentioned by Captain Wilson, over £30 was subscribed in the room, and in proof of the interest which is taken in the charitable movement by the seamen of the port, it may be stated that the sum contributed by the crew of the Thunderer amounts to an average of 4s. per man. A meeting of the general committee is appointed to meet at this dockyard this afternoon.

Although the Coroner's jury has agreed in finding a verdict exonerating the captain, officers, and crew of the Eurydice from any culpability as regards the loss of the ship, it has been noticed that they expressly do so from the evidence that was adduced before them, and as this consisted necessarily of the statements of the able seaman Cuddiford, and the ordinary seamen Fletcher, a mere lad, who was below at the time the ship was struck, it is thought that further investigation into the circumstances of the wreck is called for. A Naval Court of Inquiry will be held on board the Duke of Wellington, at Portsmouth, under the presidency of Admiral Fanshawe and Admiral Hall. The Secretary of the Admiralty has already visited the port for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements. The great difficulty is to account for Captain Hare crowding his vessel with canvas at a time when the falling of the barometer showed that bad weather was at hand, and after other ships had shortened sail. There has been no rumours of panic, but it is thought that the efforts of the officers at the supreme moment of being struck may have been partly arrested by the fact that the ship was manned by ordinary seamen who were comparatively inexperienced. It is also regarded as unusual that a ship with all ger canvas spread and cutting through the water at about nine knots should have had her lee ports open. Had the ports been closed, or had they been closed as soon as the squall was noticed, it is thought that the ship would have righted herself after being struck, even had there been no time to lower the balliards and shorten sail. The body of Lieutenant Tabor, the IFrst Lietenant, was conveyed to the relatives of the deceased at Cheam by the last train on Tuesday night, and yesterday the body of Captain Ferrier was removed to Edinburgh for interment, the men-of-war in harbour lowering their ensigns sa it was brought on shore. It is known that no bodies are on the weather deck, and it is not believed that many of the bodies of the port watch will be recovered as they would most probably be carried out to sea with the ebb tide, assisted by the wind. It is, however, thought that the starboard watch will all be found between decks. One hundred and twenty coffins have been ordered to be forwarded to Haslar Hospital in readiness for the reception of the bodies. 

The riggers and divers went out again on Wednesday, to the wreck, but the weather was too boisterous to enable them to get near. The weather having moderated, they went out again in the afternoon, and succeeded in getting of the fore royal and letting go her fore tack and sheet. They very nearly succeeded in clearing the foresail, but as the tide was coming up strong, they were obliged to desist for the night. Only the fore, main and mizen yards remain and when these, the slack rops, and the anchor gear have been cleared, the ship will be ready for slinging. Until the yards are removed itis dangerous for the divers to go between decks, and it is doubtful whether the bodies will be reached until the ship is afloat.

Nothing further has occurred with reference to the Eurydice. The tugs went out of Portsmouth harbour yesterday meorning to continue operations on the wreck, but when they reached Southsea pier they encountered so heavy a sea that it was deemed useless to proceed further, and they returned to harbour. The Pearl, corvette and the Rinaldo, sloop, which latter was formerly prepared to lift the Oberon off the shoal at the mouth of Portsmouth harbour, are being fitted to assist in lifting the Eurydice and floating her in Sandown bay. A number of purchases will be required, and a couple of weeks will probably elapse before operations will be commenced. A light ship has been moored near the wreck.

Orders have been given by the Admiralty for the widows of the petty officers and seamen to be paid a sum of money equaly to one year's pay of their deceased husbands. This is the customary dole.

The Lord Mayor has intimated to the naval authorities at Portsmouth his willingness to receive subscriptions at the Mission House in aid of the fund now being raised for the relief of the widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of the men lost.

Lieutenant-General Price Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Tesk, and Admiral Sir Spencer Robinson, K.C.B. have joined the Eurydice Fund Ciommittee, of which Lord Henry Lennox is hon. secretary.

"Visitor" writes to us from Mitcham:

"On Sunday last I was walking with my son from Epsom Downs to Dorking via Headley Common, one of the most exposed pieces of table land in Surrey. About a quarter past 4 we observed an enormous black cloud like a monster balloon. It seemed to burst in a moment and for two minutes at least here was a regular tornado, which very nearly knocked us down. THe sno which followed lasted about three quarters of an hour, and on reaching a roadside inn we found that what appeared to be snow on our clothes was hard-frozen ice."

TO THE EDITOR

Sir, in the accounts which have appeared of the loss of the Eurydice and in the articles of which this sad catastrophe has furnished the text, I have seen no remark made on the conincidence that a somewhat similar fate, under somewhat similar circumstances,— for it was almost within sight of her destination — befell her ill-fated consort ship 15 years ago. COnsort ship I say, for the ship alluded to is the Orpheus. The loss of the Orpheus, as it happened on the other side of the world, has perhaps been forgotten here. Her Majesty's ship Orpheus, carrying the pendant of the Commodore of the Australia station, was entering the Manukau harbout, near Auckland, on her voyage to New Zealand. It was a fine Saturday afternoon in February or March, 1863. Mistaking the channel she struck on the bar; Commodore, officers and men took the the rigging, but were swept awy by the surf, the paymaster, two mid-dhipmen, and some 40 men being the only ones saved out of a large ship's company. I am speaking from memory only, but I saw the survivors brought on shore, and this, I think, was the number. The conincidence that two ships so connected by their names should be lost when their wished for havens were all but reached seems worthy of remark.  
I am your obedient servant,  
H. Stratton Bates.

CAPSIZING OF THE EURYDICE. LIVES LOST

We regret to have to record that during the sudden and severe snowstorm which occurred Sunday afternoon her Majesty's ship Eurydice, Admiralty training ship for second-class seamen, capsized off Dunnose, a headland near the the south east coast of the Isle of Wight. A schooner picked up five of the crew, but three of then died subsequently, one of them being Tabor, the first lieutenant, who was brought ashore at Ventnor. The only survivors are Benjamin Cuddiford, of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, of Bristol, first-class boy, aged 19. These two men are well provided for at the Cottage Hospital, Bonchurch. The Eurydice was commissioned in Portsmouth 1877, and sent to the Barbados station.

Ventnor, Monday Night.

There is now no doubt that during the sudden squall which passed over the British Isles on Sunday afternoon one of the most terrible disasters that has ever befallen the English navy occurred off the Isle of Wight, resulting in the almost immediate foundering of a well-found man-of-war, and the drowning of 328 souls of 330 who were on board her. The Eurydice, though an old fashioned wooden frigate, has gone to the bottom precisely the same way as the newly designed turret ship Captain did, that is:– She has been capsized owing to the press of canvas she was carrying, when suddenly struck by a squall, and sad to relate, the number who have perished with her is not far short of the total lost off the coast of Spain in Sept., 187O. The Eurydice was an old 26-gun sailing frigate, and in her day was regarded as a crack vessel. She had been laying up at Portsmouth for years until 1876 the Admiralty, at the suggestion of the late Mr, Ward Hunt, determined to utilise her as a seagoing training ship for ordinary seamen. This course, gave very general satisfaction to the service, it being felt that some more extended knowledge of working a big ship at sea was needed for our young sailors than they could possibly obtain by cruising about the Channel in the summer in the five, brigs hitherto employed for that purpose. Accordingly in February, 1877, the Eurydice was commissioned Portsmouth by Captain Marcus A. S. Hare, having a complement of 280 hands, by far the larger proportion being ordinary seamen of the second-class. For this she cruised about the Channel. Captain Hare fulfilling his special duty of instruction in the most satisfactory manner, and justifying his selection for such command by his special knowledge of sailing a ship. This was especially illustrated last summer, when he brought his vessel under sail from Plymouth Sound right into the Hamoaze, a feat which to that time had not been attempted for many years. At the commencement of the last winter, the Admiralty ordered the Eurydice to proceed on a winter cruise to the West Indies, and she did so, being accompanied by two brigs, also manned by ordinary seamen. She was returning from that cruise on Sunday, and was within an hour's sail of Spithead, when the terrible catastrophe chronicled below befel her. The Eurydice left Bermuda on the 6th inst., having on board, in addition to her own crew, some time-expired men both from the army and navy, and some prisoners, bringing the total number on board to 330. She had a very fair passage all the way home, passing the Lizard on Sunday morning, and being off the Isle of Wight soon after three the afternoon of that day. At that time the wind was light and the sea smooth, although at noon there had been a fresh breeze blowing. The ship had all plain sails set, with studding sails on the port side; the wind from the southwest, and being on the port quarter. Thus it will be seen that she was under a heavy press of canvas, though those who saw her say that it was not too much, considering the force of the wind that time.

THE MOMENT OF THE DISASTER.

From what could be gathered this morning from the two survivors, prior to their being despatched to Portsmouth to see the Commanderin-in-Chief, it seems that, 3.30 p.m., they, in common with many their comrades, were on the lower deck having tea. About quarter to four, Cuddiford says he heard the boatswain's mate pipe hands to shorten sail, and he and others at once proceeded on deck to execute the order. On getting up the ladder, however, he found that the ship had been struck by a tremendous squall, which had first come from the north-west, and that she was heeling over very fast on the starboard side. Captain Hare was the bridge giving instructions for shortening the sail, but this was never actually done, as the men on deck, seeing that the ship was rapidly turning over, proceeded to jump from her side into the sea. Cuddiford and Fletcher, the two survivors, both did this, and they attribute their being rescued alive to their knowledge of swimming. Cuddiford says that three or four minutes elapsed between the pipe to shorten sail and the ship going down, and an indication of the time of the vessel foundering is given by the watch found on the body of Captain Ferrier, R.E., which stopped precisely at eight minutes four.

FIRST TIDINGS OF THE CATASTROPHE.

The first tidings of the disaster were communicated to the shore the captain of the schooner Emma, of Padstow. He anchored his vessel off the coastguard station at Ventnor, and hoisted a signal of distress, upon which the inspecting officer of coastguards, Commander Roche, and the chief officer proceeded to her a boat. On learning the true nature of things, Commander Roche despatched some of his men for medical assistance, and, with others, tried to restore animation to the five persons who had been rescued. Two surgeons of Ventnor were very soon in attendance, but all efforts to restore life failed, except in the case of Cuddiford and Fletcher, who, when they could be removed, were taken on shore and treated the Cottage Hospital. The bodies were removed to the shore, and placed in shed near the Esplanade.

NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE EMMA.

The captain of the schooner Emma afforded the following information:– He stated that he was on voyage from Padstow to Poole in ballast, and that he was proceeding up Channel on Sunday afternoon, when he observed the Eurydice with all sail set. She was much nearer the land than his vessel. He observed that the wind was shifting about and the weather looking threatening, consequently he shortened sail. The squall was accompanied by a very heavy fall of snow, and when this had cleared away be looked around and could see no signs of tho Eurydice. He continued on his course when suddenly he heard someone shouting for assistance. He once lowered a boat, which succeeded in picking five persons and bringing them on board the schooner. He cruised about the spot for some time, but being unable to observe any one else, he then stood in for the shore. The five persons rescued by the Emma proved Benjamin Cuddiford, able seaman, of the Eurydice, whose home is at Plymouth; Sydney Fletcher, ordinary seaman, of the Rover, who was taking passage in the Eurydice, and who resides Bristol; Lieutenant Francis Hope Tabor, First Lieutenant of the Eurydice, who resided at Cheam, Surrey; Captain Terrier, R.E., who was taking passage in the Eurydice; and petty officer, named Bennett, late of the Rover, who was also taking passage. It is known that Bennett was married man, but neither of the rescued men have any idea where his wife resides. The captain of the schooner believes that Lieut. Tabor, Captain Ferrier, and Bennett were dead when they were pioked up, and in this view the medical men concurred.

DISTRESSING SCENE

A heardrending scene occurred this afternoon when Mrs. Tabor, who had been married to the deceased officer but 15 months arrived in town, and proceeded to identify the body of her husband. Her grief was terrible to behold, so great, indeed, that the men who had charge of the house where the remains lay, felt themselves unable to remain in the place, leaving the unfortunate lady alone with the dead.

THE SURVIVORS INTERVIEWED.  
[CENTRAL NEWS TELEGRAM. |

Portsmouth, Monday Night.  
With reference to the wreck the Eurydice, matters remain much about the same as this, morning. This afternoon, the two survivors were by special orders brought to Admiral Tenchore at Portsmouth, by whom they were interviewed , privately for the information of the Admiralty. Subsequently they were seen by the Central News Portsmouth, correspondent, to whom the following information was detailed:— Ben. Cuddiford, 35, single, said: I was able seaman on board the Eurydice. I was on the port watch Sunday afternoon. I went on deck at noonday. There were then one hundred and fifty men deck in the watch. We were to come off watch at four o'clock. We were under full sail, making for Spithead. We set the lowest studsail just before two o'olock, and took it in again about quarter to four, just when the gale and snow storm came upon us. We had taken in the lower studsails and were about to take in the upper sails, the men being aloft, when the ship gave a lurch, and the captain ordered the men to come down, as the ship was listing over to starboard, and the water was coming over the lee bulwarks. I cannot say whether they had got down when the ship turned over. I was the weather side, letting go the ropes to let the sails ease off. After the first turn over she righted a bit, some few feet, and then went down bow first. As she sank, she gradually turned over, and I and number of men got on to the bottom near the keel. The captain was also on the bottom and remained fast. I and some other men jumped astern of the sinking ship, which remained on her side for about five minutes and then went down bow first. I and another seaman, who was afterwards drowned, tried to cut away the cutter on the port side of the ship as she was sinking. We had got one of the grips undone when the vessel went down, and we were obliged leave it. I picked up a lifebuoy, and having fastened to myself struck out away from the ship. As the vessel sank the suction carried down a number of people. I passed the two surgeons, but could not render them any assistance. One of them, Mr. Murdock, was has shirt sleeves, but they were too much exhausted to cry out. The wind was just abaft the beam on the port tack. There were four guns on board, but all were well secured. The ports, however, were opened. Captain Hare was very fond of the ship, and all the crew had great faith in her. The captain was on deck in charge of the watch, and was giving orders just before we were struck by the gale. We were going about eight and a half knots, and there was no sign of a squall. About ten minutes to four were turned on dock to lower studsails and to get in upper sails. As I have before stated, when the captain ordered us down from aloft I did not hear anything carried away, and cannot say Whether any of the masts went by the board. There were about 150 men on deck altogether in the watch.

SCENES THE WATER.

I saw one of the officers, Mr. Murdock, swimming in the water. I also saw the boatswain, Mr. Brewer, swimming about. He was much exhausted, and his eyes appeared to be starting out of his head. I was in water about one hour and twenty minutes. I did not seem to feel the cold until I stepped on to the deck of the schooner that rescued us, and then I appeared to lose consciousness. The seaman named Bennett, captain of the quarter-deck, was the man who tried to get away the cutter with me. Poor fellow, he was drowned. His wife saw him off at Portsmouth. Lieut. Tabor and Captain Ferrier, of the Royal Engineers, were also in the water with us, but both died after getting on board the schooner that rescued us. We were very kindly treated on board the Emma. I saw several men pass me in the water, and two surgeons, but they were too exhausted to speak.

IN THE GRASP OF DEATH.

Sydney Fletcher, 19, single, belonging to Bristol, corroborated the narrative of Cuddiford, and added that, on jumping off the wreck, a number of men attempted to seize them in the endeavour to be saved. They had, however, most reluctantly to push them off. One poor fellow seized Fletcher's cork waistcoat, and in order to save himself he had to thrust the unfortunate man away, and he sank to rise no more. The cries of the drowning were most piteous to listen to.

THE CAPTAIN FIRM AT HIS POST.

The last time the survivors saw the captain, was when he was standing firm to his post on the sinking vessel. As she disappeared beneath the waves, dozens of poor fellows were dragged down by the vortex caused by the sinking vessel. Having made their depositions to the Admiral, at Portsmouth, the two survivors returned to the Isle Wight, in the charge of Dr. Wells, of , Ventnor. The two men were eagerly questioned by many relatives of those who had gone down in the Eurydice, and the effect upon them, caused by the hopeless answers of the survivors, was most distressing to witness.

LIST OF THE SHIP'S OFFICERS.

Ventnor, Moday Night.

The wreck is lying directly in the course of vessels going up and down Channel, and efforts are now being made to remove the masts, sails, and rigging, for which purpose riggers, shipwrights, and divers from Portsmouth dockyard are employed.

The officers of the Eurydice included the following: —Captain Marcus A. S. Hare, Lieut. Francis H. Tabor, Lieut. Charles V. Strange, Lieut. J. E. Black, Lieut. Stanley, A. B. Burney, staff surgeon; Jas. L. Whitney, paymaster; Frank Pitman, sub-lieutenant; Hon. Edward B. Gifferd, sub-lieutenant; Herbert S. Edmunds, sub-lieutenant; Walter S. Smith, sub-lieutenant; Sidney G. Randolph, surgeon; Robt. Murdock, M.B., gunner; Fredk. Allen, boatswain; Wm. Brewer, boatswain; Joseph Warren, assistant-clerk; Wm. Lamont, sub-lieutenant. The Hon. Edward Robert Gifford was brother and heir-presumptive to Lord Gifford, who served with distinction in the Ashantee expedition. The bodies of Captain Terrier and of Mr. Bennett, petty officer, were identified by the survivors.

THE INQUEST AND VERDICT.

On Tuesday afternoon, the Coroner for the Isle of Wight, Mr. Frederick Blake, opened an inquest on the bodies Francis Hope Tabor, late first-lieutenant of the Eurydice, Captain L.ouis John George Ferrier, R.E., and Bennett, a petty officer, which had been landed from the schooner Emma by the crew of which vessel they had been picked up, along with the two survivors. The jury consisted of 13 gentlemen residing Ventnor.

Mr. R. Montagu Tabor said he lived Carshalton, Surrey. He had seen the body which had been viewed the jury, and he identified it as his brother, Lieut. Tabor. He last saw him alive about five or six months ago. He had since been to the West Indies in the Eurydice, and was on his way home her when the catastrophe occurred. Deceased would have been 30 years of age in July next.

Benjamin Cuddiford said; I am an A.8., and reside at Millbay, Plymouth. I have seen the bodies of three deceased, and I am able to identity them. They are Lieut. Tabor, a man named Bennett, I do not know his Christian name, and a Captain of R.E., who was taking passage in the ship. Lieut. Tabor was first lieutenant on the Eurydice, and I was A. B. on board her. Bennett was captain of the quarter deck. She was a wooden sailing ship of four guns, She has been employed as a training ship, having been thirteen months on commission. During the winter she has been all round the West India Islands. Her captain was Captain Marcus Hare. We left Bermuda on our homeward voyage on the 6th March, being bound for Portsmouth. I should think, but I am not certain, that we had over 300 officers and men on board, including supernumeraries. There were about 30 men belonging the ship's company and the rest were ordinary seamen, who, at the conclusion of a training, leave the ship. On Sunday last, just before two o'clock, we were turned on deck to set the lower studding soil. The ship was then off the Isle of Wight. All plain sail had been set before this. All was set except the topgallant studding sails, and they were unbent. The weather at that time was very fine, the wind, which was blowing a moderate breeze, being just abaft the beam. Between 3.30 and 4 o'clock the port watch was called to take in the lower studding sail. We had not then encountered a squall, but it was looking dirty. Captain Hare gave the order, saying " Watch in, lower studding sail." It was then coming on to blow hard. This sail was taken in, and Captain Hare then gave orders to the royal yacht men go aloft and take the royals. They were not taken in as the squall then struck us, and Capt. Hare ordered the men from aloft for their safety. The royals were, I believe, lowered at beat time, but not furled. The captain gave orders as the squall caught to let go the maintopsail halfyards and the mainsheet. That was done, as I saw the gunner's mate let them go. The ship was thence on her beam ends, the men on the lee side being up to their waists in water. I heard the captain say to som one forward—"If you can't let go, cut it". I expect the captain was referring to the foresheet, but can't say. I then climbed up and got on the weather netting, and crawled on to the ship's side, as she was turning over. I did this to get on the weather side of the ship. I could see her keel and her sails were in the water. She righted a few feet, and I saw her mizen topsail out of the water. Then I looked forward and saw the ship sinking from forward, taking down a body of men with her. The water then began to increase aft, and just as it got in ine with the mainmast she turned over, and the boats turned bottom over. The ship's keel was then out of the water. I stuck to the ship, and the captain gave me orders to try and get the cutter clear by cutting the gripes. I cut the forward gripe, and then the water encroached us. The captain was just behind me on the side of the ship. The man who was helping me cut the gripe. He was named Richards, and was washed away, he being, I think, numbed with the cold. I saw the two doctors jump overboard, and I soon after did the same. I passed the two doctors drowning, but could not render them any assistance. I observed many others m the water. I swam round and got a life buoy, and then went to the assistance of others, giving them pieces of wood and spars. I had on lifebuoy. The ship must have gone down just as I jumped off. The captain was still on her side, and he went down on her. I saw six men on the bottom of a boat called the copper punt. I spoke to them. They asked me if there was any hope, and I told them to keep their spirits up. They were washed off the bottom of the punt one by one. I saw one let go owing to the cold. One of the men clinging to the boat was called Mason, another Martin. There was a cook's mate who was taking passage home, he having been left behind by the Tamar. The other three men were ordinary seamen. I saw one other person, Mr. Brewer, the boatswain, with a lifebuoy. As the squall came on I turned my back to it. When the mist cleared away I saw Fletcher near me. I made for the shore, and he did the same. We were swimming about for an hour and 20 minutes, when we were picked up by the schooner. When I got to my feet on the schooner I felt giddy. I was sensible when they picked me up, as I got hold of a rope which they flung to me.

By the Jury: came to blow between 3 and 3.30. We had afterwards a tremendous squall, which must have been the cause of the capsizing of the vessel. A snowstorm came on, and we could not see the land. There was an attempt to bring her up to the wind, there being five men at the wheel, and the Hon. Mr. Gifford, sub-lieutenant, went to assist them. An attempt was made to put the helm up after we could not take in the royals. I cannot say if the helm was put up or not. When the ship was on even keel, the ports were four or five feet above water. The guns were well secured on board, and were not shifted at all. There was one watch, which might number 150, below at the time the order was given to shorten sail. They were writing and sleeping. The captain gave orders to shorten sail as soon as he saw the squall coming quick.

The Coroner: Who was the officer of the watch at the time?— Witness: I recollect now, which I didn't yesterday, that Sub-Lieutenant Randolph was the officer of the watch. He was forward, helping to shorten sail when the squall came on. The ship went down five minutes after she first got on her beam ends. When she first heeled, the starboard quarter boats were filled and carried away. The galley was smashed, and it was impossible to lower any of the boats. The captain was on deck just before the squall came on. There was a life buoy on each side of the bridge, and one on each bow of the launch forward, and one astern— five, in all, on deck. There were about twelve lifebelts in one of the launches, as they had been in use the day before, when the men were over the side painting.

By Mr. Harvey: Directly the captain saw the squall commg, he ordered the reduction of sail, and the largest one in the ship was taken in at once, that being the lower studding sail. The men were lowering the royals when the captain, seeing the squall coming on, shouted them down, and added—"Let go-the main topsail halyards and the main sheet." The captain ordered the men down for fear the topgallant mast and royal mast would be carried away with the men on it.

Mr. Harvey: As an able seaman do you think there was any fault in seamanship to account for the loss of this vessel?— Witness: No, sir. The captain was a thorough seaman, and so were all the officers. I have been in the service nearly 21 years, and I have never seen a squall come so suddenly before.

Captain George Henry Ferrier, of the 105th regiment, now quartered Colchester, identified the body of his brother, Captain Louis John George Ferrier, R.E., who was quartered at Bermuda. He was, witness surmised, coming home on leave, and probably the captain of the Eurydice gave him a passage. Deceased was in his 38th year.

Sydney Fletcher, aged 19, said: I was first-class orderly seaman on board the Eurydice. It was my watch below last Sunday from noon to four p.m. was getting my tea to come on watch at that time, when I heard a rush of water coming in through the ports which are on the main deck. Immediately before that she had given a rather strong lurch. I lowered the after port and ran on deck. The water was then coming over the starboard nettings. I assisted in overhauling the foretop sail halyards. I then got over the port netting and walked right aft on the side of the ship. I walked below her ports. She was then on her side and the water nearly amidships. It was blowing hard and snowing at the time, and the sea was breaking over the ship. I saw the captain standing on the side of the ship giving orders to clear away the cutter. I picked a life belt and jumped into the sea. Mr. Edwards, the sub-lieutenant, took off his coat and jumped overboard just as did. I saw Lieutenant Tabor on the side of the ship in his shirt sleeves and without his cap. I also saw him in the water floating on a wash deck locker. I shouted to the schooner and was so full of joy when I saw her I did not know what was doing. I saw Bennett and the boatswain floating me. I did not notice the wind increase before the ship lurched. I do not think more than two men of the starboard watch got on deck besides me. I heard them crying and screaming. I got up as my mess was close to the forward hatchway. I know that we had iron ballast, and that the water and stores acted as ballast as well.

Cuddiford recalled said the Eurydice had the proper ballast for her tonnage, and beyond that there was a lower tier of tanks, full of water, which was never disturbed.

William Langworthy Jenkins said: I am master of the schooner Emma, of Padstow, and on Sunday last I was proceeding from Newcastle to Poole. About 10 minutes past 4 we encountered a sudden squall, while we were off Dunnose. Previously to it coming on it was looking bad to the windward. Therefore I ordered the flying jib to hauled down and also the main top mast staysail and other sails. Afterwards I lowered foresail. Then I only had the standing jib set properly on my ship. We did this during tne squall which lasted half an hour. The Emma was from four to five miles from land when the squall struck her. I saw nothing of the Eurydice before she went down, but after the snowstorm I saw something floating on the water, and it being reported to be a man I steered towards it. I heard cries for help and found five men floating. They were about a quarter of a mile apart from one another. We picked them up and all were exhausted and insensible. We took them in the cabin and stripped them and rubbed them. Cuddiford and Fletcher were able to take some coffee, but the others could not. Medical men came, but three were dead then, Bennett, fact, was dead when he was picked up. I should not have thought the squall was of such force as to capsize such a vessel as the Eurydice, even when under full sail.

Dr. Winson proved having tried to restore animation to the deceased, but failed to do so. He believed death resulted from drowning in each case.

Henry Parkinson, able seaman on board the Emma, proved seeing the Eurydice ten minutes before the squall. She had plain sail on her, and it was not, in his opinion, too much, considering the weather, for her to be then carrying. He was surprised to hear of her loss. He had been in a great deal heavier squalls, and he noticed in some cases a vessel dismantled, while another close by had escaped.

Photographs showing the partiality of this squall were put in.

This being all the evidence, and the Jury believing the whole of the facts which could be before them had been proved, the Coroner proceeded to sum up.

VERDICT.

The jury retired, and after an absence of half hour, returned with the following verdict:— "The jury unanimously find that the three deceased were accidentally drowned owing to the capsizing of her Majesty's ship Eurydice, by a sudden squall, at Dunnose, on Sunday, the 24th inst., and the jury consider that, from the evidence adduced, no blame whatever can attach to the captain, officers, and men of the ship."

LOSS OF H.M.S. EURYDICE, WITH THREE HUNDRED MEN

The wreck of the Eurydice, the training-ship for young ordinary seamen, of the Isle of Wight, and almost within sight of Spithead, to which place she was approaching at the end of a pleasant and successful cruise to the West Indies, is a disaster which calls to mind the loss of the Captain off Cape Finisterre. With this exception, there is nothing to compare with the calamity which occurred on Sunday afternoon, so far as the Navy is concerned, though the loss of life has frequently been exceeded by the sinking of emigrant-vessels. The circumstances are similar in many respects to those attending the loss of the Captain, both ships having turned over and sunk during a gale of wind, all their sail being at the time set. So far as can be ascertained, the Eurydice had 368 souls on board at the time. But this is very much a matter of conjecture, as, besides her own officers and crew, she was bringing home a number of military officers, supernumeraries, and invalids from the West Indies. Hence considerable uncertainty exists both as to the names and number of the sufferers.

The Eurydice was a wooden, full-rigged sailing ship of 921 tons displacement, and was at one time considered one of the smartest and quickest twenty-six-gun frigates in the service. She was built about 1843. Last year she was converted into a training-ship for ordinary seamen at Mr. John White's yard at Cowes, and was completed for sea at Portsmouth Dockyard. She was commissioned on Feb. 7, 1877, and finally sailed from Portsmouth on Nov. 13 with a crew of about 300 ordinary seamen and the officers. All the officers and crew are lost, with the exception of two seamen.

Captain Marcus Hare had been at one time Commander of the St. Vincent, training-ship at Portsmouth, and was selected for the command from his knowledge and experience of young seamen. Lieutenant Francis Tabor was a thoroughly efficient sailor, haying had command of the Cruiser in the Mediterranean. Among the other officers who have perished is Sub-Lieutenant the Hon. Edward Robert Gifford, next brother to Lord Gifford. The Eurydice was accompanied from Portsmouth by the training-brig Martin, and was joined at Madeira by the Liberty from Plymouth. These vessels were filled with ordinary seamen, whom it was considered necessary to inure to the sea by a long cruise : and. as they were all draughted from the home training-ships, the distress caused by their loss is spread over the whole country. They were young and mostly unmarried men ; in this respect the crew differs from that of the Captain, who were principally able-bodied seamen and petty officers. The Liberty arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago, the Eurydice being detained for the purpose of taking up supernumeraries. Captain Hare, however, expected to be home almost as soon as the Martin.

The Eurydice left Bermuda on the 6th inst., and nothing was heard of her until she was seen by the coastguard at Bonchurch, at 3.30 on Sunday afternoon, bearing for Spithead under all plain sail, and with her port stunsails set on the fore-topmast and maintopinast, the object being clearly to arrive at the anchorage at Spithead before nightfall. There was an ominous stillness prevailing at this time. A heavy bank of clouds was coming down from the north-west, and the glass was falling rapidly. Such wind as there was came from the westward, and blew on the port quarter of the ship.

The Isle of Wight is of peculiar formation on its southern fringe, having what may be considered as a double coast line extending from Blackgang Chine as far as Shanklin. The inner circle of the downs reaches a height of 500 ft. above the sea, and affords a deceptive shelter to ships well in shore. From the direction in which the Eurydice was steering she would be in comparatively smooth water, sheltered by the downs, until she rounded Dunnose Head, where the disaster occurred. This circumstance will also serve to explain the fact that the Emma, schooner, which was near at the time, was not affected by the gale.

At ten minutes to four the wind suddenly veered round from the west to the eastward, and a gale, accompanied by a blinding fall of snow, came rushing from the high lands down Luccombe Chine, striking the Eurydice just a little before the beam, driving her out of her course, which was heading to the north-east, and turning her bows to the east. This is what seems probable, though, from the manner in which the sea was concealed by the snow, nothing was seen of her at the supreme moment when she capsized to starboard. The air cleared as suddenly as it became overcast, the wind sinking away at the same time. 

As soon as anything could be seen, the masts and top-hamper of the ship were discerned above the water about 2 3/4 miles ENE. off Dunnose, a well-known and lofty landmark between Shanklin and Ventnor. The ship lies in eleven fathoms of water, and from her position she appears to have righted in going down.

Of the whole number of souls on board, only two persons succeeded in reaching the shore alive. These are an able seaman named Benjamin Cuddiford, a native of Plymouth, and Sydney Fletcher, an ordinary first-class seaman, aged nineteen, belonging to Bristol. Lieutenant Tabor died before reaching the shore, and the only other bodies which have been recovered are those of Colonel Ferrier, R.E., and a petty officer named Bennett. Their bodies, which were picked up as they drifted towards Ventnor on an ebb tide, were taken into a cottage at Ventnor, to await the Coroner's inquiry.

The two survivors were first taken to the Esplanade and subsequently to the Cottage Hospital at Bonchurch, where they were attended by Dr. Williamson, of Ventnor, for the night. They were both brought over to Portsmouth on Monday afternoon. Much surprise has been caused by the small number rescued, and this more especially as the time being at hand for the changing of the watch a great many men would be on deck at the time. It appears, too, that the crew were assembling for prayers. Ordinary seamen are taught swimming as part of their training for the sea. No doubt numbers threw themselves overboard when the ship capsized, and were sucked down by the ship and carried out to sea by the tide ; but it is likely that the majority succumbed through becoming chilled by the cold

Captain Langworthy Jenkins, master of the Emma schooner, bound from Newcastle for Poole with coals, was the means of rescuing the survivors, and brought his ship into Portsmouth. He states that at forty-five minutes past four on Sunday afternoon, after a heavy squall, the atmosphere cleared, and he observed some wreckage and the royals of a ship flapping above the water. He also fancied he heard some one shouting for assistance. He sent a man into the rigging to look out, who reported that he saw a man floating in the water with a cork jacket. He immediately made sail and stood towards him. Having to tack once to fetch him, he hoisted out boats, which picked up four men, and one man was picked up from the ship. He did his best to restore their circulation, but one of the men had died before he was got on board. Captain Jenkins then stood for Ventor with colours half-mast high and a boat came off. A doctor was sent for, but two other men died before he arrived. The Coastguard boat afterwards came alongside with Commander Roach, who recognised the body of Lieutenant Tabor, the First Lieutenant of the Eurydice, and the other as an officer of the Royal Engineers. When the men were picked up, Dunnoee bore NW. by W. three to four miles.
 
The boy Fletcher is too weak to furnish full particulars of the sad affair. He states, however, that he was below with the greater part of the crew, when, hearing a noise, he rushed up the hatchway and heard a cry, "All hands for themselves !" He caught a life-buoy and jumped overboard, as did also the rest who were picked up. A minute afterwards the ship gave a lurch forward and sank, drawing him down to a considerable distance; but the life-buoy raised him again. In an account given by Cuddiford, which we insert below, is stated that the ship capsized in a squall and snowstorm, at, as nearly as he can state, four o'clock in the afternoon, when they were five miles from Dunnose. There were over 300 men on board, all of whom, except himself and Sydney Fletcher, who belonged to the Rover, were, he thought, drowned.

A telegram having been forwarded on Sunday evening to the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth informing him of the occurrence, Admiral Fanshawe at once dispatched the two Government tugs the Grinder and the Camel to the wreck, in charge of Commanders Polkinghome and Dathan, the two Master Attendants of the yard. The wreck was reached about midnight. The ship was found lying on her starboard bilge, on a fine sandy beach, in eleven fathoms of water, and with her head about south-east, having almost slewed round during the circular storm. Her fore and mizen topgallant masts had been carried away, the topgallant sails hung before the topsails, with the main topgallant masts standing, and all her sails set. Leaving Commander Dathan in charge of the wreck, Commander Polkinghome came back to Portsmouth at five o'clock on Monday morning to report to the Commander-in-Chief and to dispatch the requisite aid. The Grinder accordingly sailed to the spot with twenty-five riggers, some shipwrights, and a couple of divers, with the necessary gear. The sails and tophamper of the wreck were removed, and the tugs will remain to watch the spot. There will be no difficulty in raising the ship by means of lumps. As a matter of form, a court-martial will be held upon the two survivors. These two on arrival at Portsmouth, were taken to Admiralty House, before the Commander-in-Chief, and were afterwards taken to Ventnor, in order that they might give evidence before the county Coroner for the Isle of Wight. Before leaving Portsmouth, Cuddiford made a statement to Admiral Foley of the circumstances attending the wreck. He said: 

"At seven bells on Sunday afternoon the watch at a quarter to four o’clock was called to take in lower studdingsails. I was on deck to tend the lower tack, and let it go. The Captain gave orders to take in the upper sails. The wind was then freshening. The Captain ordered the men to come down from aloft and then to let go the topsail-halliards. The gunner's mate let go the topsail-halliards, and another man, Bryant, let the mainsheet. The water was then running over the lee netting on the starboard side, and washed away the cutter. The foretopmast studding-sail was set. The wind was about a point abaft the port beam. I caught hold of the main truss, fell, and caught hold of the weather netting and got on the ship’s side. We could see her keel. She righted a little before going down, ringing the mizen-topsail out of the water. She then went gradually over from forward, the greater part of the hands being at the forepart of the ship outside. She then turned over, bringing the port cutter bottom upwards. I and another, Richards, out the foremost gripe, and then saw the Captain standing on the vessel's side near the quarter-boat and the two doctors struggling in the water. I swam some distance, keeping over my head a lifebuoy, which I found, and then picked up some piece of wreck, which I gave to some of the men in the water. I then came across the copper punt full of water, five men were it. The sea capsized the punt, and they all got on the bottom. They asked me if there was any signs of help. I told them that the best thing they could do was to keep their spirits up. One of them was just letting go his hold of the punt. Ido not know his name. I next saw Mr. Brewer, the boatswain, with a cork lifebelt on. He was struggling strongly. I then saw Fletcher in the water with a cork belt and breaker. I lost sight of him during the snow. About five minutes afterwards the weather cleared up. I saw Fletcher again, and we kept together. Then we saw land, but, finding it too rough, we turned our backs to the land and saw a schooner. The schooner bore down on us, sent a boat, and picked up two officers that I had not previously noticed with a wash-deck locker. A rope's end was thrown to me from the schooner, and I was then picked up. I judge that I was in the water one hour and twenty minutes. The officers picked up were Lieutenant Tabor and a captain of the Royal Engineers who came on board at Bermuda with one corporal, one bombardier, four privates, and a servant of officer of the Royal Engineers. The ship capsized about ten minutes before four o'clock. The captain was giving orders at the time, and was carrying out his duty. We rounded on the weather beam, and set the lower studding-sail, at two p.m. The ship was then going eight knots and a half. I don't know who was the officer of the watch, as the captain was carrying on the duty. The Hon. Mr. Gifford went to the wheel to help at the time the water was coming over the lee nettings, in consequence of an order being given to put the helm up. There were the following supernumeraries on board :—Three court-martial prisoners from the Rover; one A.B., court-martial prisoner from Bermuda; an ordinary seaman, named Parker, who had been tried by court-martial (he belonged to the Eurydice); and about twelve or fourteen Marines, with one sergeant of Marines from Bermuda Dockyard, two invalids from Bermuda Hospital, one ship's corporal from the Argus, one captain's cook from the Argus, one engineer's steward from the Argus, one ship's cook from Bermuda Dockyard, one quartermaster, named Nicholas, from the Rover. I believe some of the maindeck ports were open to let in the air to the main-deck mess. I don't think the hands were turned ; there was hardly time for that. I saw most of the men forward take off their clothes and jump off before I lost sight of them in the squall. When the snow cleared the ship was gone down."

During Monday the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth was in constant communication with her Majesty and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty; and in the course of the day he received the following telegrams from the Queen. The first, which came direct from her Majesty, was in the following terms:—

"The Queen is deeply grieved to hear of the loss of the Eurydice. Her Majesty anxiously asks for further details."

The second was transmitted to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and was to the following effect:—

"The Queen would ask Mr. Smith to make known her grief at the terrible calamity to the Eurydioe, and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted friends and relatives."

In another telegram to Mr. Smith the Queen said the telegrams had caused her the greatest grief. These telegrams, haying been forwarded to Admiral Fanshawe, were promptly posted at the dockyard gates, where they were eagerly read by sympathetic crowds.

Admiral Foley visited the wreck in the course of the afternoon, and, from an examination of the rigging and gear of the ship, he is firmly of opinion that the crew were in the act of shortening sail at the time the ship sank. In this opinion he is supported by the pilots who are assisting at the wreck. They found that the topsails had been let go, and that the mizentopsail was actually resting on the cap. The squall, however was evidently too sudden and powerful for the crew to relieve the ship in time. There is also reason for concluding that the ports on both sides were open, and that the water rushed in on the starboard side, which prevented the ship from righting and pulled her over. The divers and riggers were engaged on Monday in relieving the wreck of her spars and sails. No attempt has yet been made to penetrate below decks. It is expected that a month will elapse before the ship can be raised and brought into harbour.

The inquest on the bodies of Lieutenant Tabor, Captain Louis Ferrier, R.E., and an ordinary seaman named Bennett, was held at Ventnor on Tuesday, by Mr. F. Blake, Coroner for the Isle of Wight. Mr. E. J. Harvey, of Portsmouth, attended as agent for the Admiralty, with Commander Roche, of the Coastguard. The principal evidence was that of Benjamin Cuddiford and of Sydney Fletcher the only survivors from the Eurydice; and that of Captain Jenkins, master of the Emma schooner, which they were picked up. The statement of Cuddiford at the inquest was not materially different from that which he had before made to the Port Admiral, and which is given above; it was confirmed by the evidence of Fletcher. The jury found, as their verdict, that the deceased persons "were accidentally drowned by the capsizing of H.M.S. Eurydice a sudden squall, and that no blame whatever can be attached to the captain, officers, and men of the ship."

A committee has been formed at Portsmouth, and another in London, to raise money for the benefit of the families of the seamen and marines who have lost their lives this disaster. Messrs. Glyn, Mills, and Co., of Lombard-street, and Messrs. Cocks and Biddulph, of Charing-cross, receive subscriptions for this purpose. The members of the House of Commons have made a special subscription amongst themselves.

Our Illustration of the foundering of the Eurydice, which forms the large Engraving presented for the Extra Supplement this week, has been drawn by the aid of Sketches and verbal description supplied by the seaman Benjamin Cuddiford, one of the two survivors of the crew.

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

THE OPERATIONS AT THE WRECK.

The continued stormy weather during the past few days has caused but very slow work to be made with the wreck of the Eurydice. High winds, accompanied by a heavy ground swell, have frequently prevented the divers from going down to the vessel, and when they have been able to make a descent the difficulties which they have had to encounteir have been so many that very little progress has been made. On Saturday there was a strong and piercing wind blowing all day from the North, which effectually put a stop to all attempts to renew opetations. On the previous day during the height of the gale the *Dromedary*, lightship, which had anchored near the wreck to indicate the spot, was obliged to slip her cable and run for Portland. On Saturday, when the wind had moderated, one of the tugs went round and towed her back to the position she had previously occupied. On Sunday, of course, nothing was done, nor indeed was the weather at all favourable. Numbers of persons were attracted by curiosity to the shore at Ventnor and along the neighbouring beach, in hopes of seeing some traces of the wreck, but there was nothing to reward their search excepting a sight of the topmasts of the unfortunate ship. On Monday the wind hadr moderated considerably-at least it appeared so inside Portsmouth harbour-and hopes were entertained of a fair day's work being done. The Grinder and Camel, tugs, went out early in the morning, taking the three divers, with all their necessary appliances. Outside the  Isle of WVight, however, the wind blew freshly, and the tide threw many difficulties in the way. There was a considerable "swell" on, and although it was perfectly easy for boats to remain in position, it was not so with the divers whose occupation was rendered additionally precarious by the swinging about in the tide of the pieces of  severed rigging, sails, &c. A few minutes after nine o'clock in the morning, when the tide began to slacken, the divers made a descent, but the effect of the swell was such as to render their labours particularly troublesome and hazardous. They, however, remained down until 11 o'clock; and at two in the afternoon, on the tide being considered again favourable, they made further search, remaining under water until five o'clock, when operations were suspended for the night. The result of the day's work was to get up a part of the foresail, the studding-sail boom, and the fore topmast. A small skiff, about 14 feet long, was also sent up by the divers, and on reaching the surface one of the sides broke completely away from the other part of the boat. It is supposed to have been a small boat for the private use of some of the officers. Two of the ship's pinnaces' and cutters' masts, with all their gear attached, were also disengaged and sent up by the divers, but nothing was done with the boats themselves. The various things recovered from the wreck were brought into harbour in the evening by the tugs, and were landed at the Dockyard, where they will be stored with the other spars and rigging recovered last week. The Eurydice has at times rolled in the sea very much, and has risen off her starboard bilge, upon wshich she was first lying, and the swell has brought her up on to her keel. Her position has altered in one point, and she now lies with her head S.E. by S. The weather will have to be very steady indeed to enable the working party to continue their operations with anything like success. It is not considered at all likely that the masts of the Eurydice will be removed before the raising operations are proceeded with, as such a course is not at all necessary to the success of the attempt. Yesterday another attempt was made to clear away the top-hamper of the wreck, but the wind was again so boisterous that nothing could be done. The divers certainly went down, but the swvell was too great to permit of anything like successful work, and the Grinder, with the working party, returned early to Harbour.

DISCOVERY OF ANOTHER BODY.

A telegram last night states that the Dover and and Calais steamboat had picked up the body of a sailor, doubtless one of the crew of the Eurydice.

FUNERAL OF CAPTAIN FERRIER.

On Saturday afternoon the remains of Captain J. G. L. Ferrier, RE., of Bellside, Linlithgowshire, who was drowned by the sinking of the Eurydice, were interred with military honours in Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh. The burial service was read in St. John's Episcopal Church by the Bishop of Edinburgh, after which the procession went by way of Prince's-street, the Mound, and George IV. Bridge to the place of interment. The coffin, which was covered by the Union Jack, and on which were the deceased's hat and sword, with wreaths of *immortelles*, was conveyed on a gun-carriage drawn by six horses. Detachments of the 50th Regiment, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and the Royal Artillery took part in the procession. The streets along the route were crowded with spectators.

FUNERAL OF THE PETTY OFFICER AT HASLAR. 

On Monday afternoon the body of George Andrew Bennett, the Petty Officer who was picked up either dead, or in a dying condition, by the Emma schooner, was interred in the pretty little cemetery at Haslar. The bedy, it will probably be remembered, was removed from Ventnor to the Haslar Royal Naval Hospital on the day after the inquest and was kept as long as possible, in hopes of other bodies being found, so that a number of the crew might have been buried together. No additional bodies, however, have been recovered, and further delay being considered inexpedient, the interment was fixed for Monday. The day was exceedingly fine, and the sun, which shone brightly, seemed to bring into greater prominence the sad surroundings of the occasion. Soon after two o'clock detachments of seamen and petty officers from the flagship, *Duke of Wellington*, the *Asia* (flagship of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Fitzgerald A. C. Foley), and the Thunderer landed at the Haslar Jetty, and, accompanied by a firing party of Marines from the Duke of Wellington, proceeded to the dead-house, on the grade plot, outside of which several relations and friends had congregatcd. The word dead- house, as a rule, carries with it the idea of an ugly building, dark, close, and stuffy. The one at Haslar, however, is a model of its kind. It is not at all unsightly, either as regards its external or internal appearances, and is light and airy. Seats are placed in the lobby for the accommodation of mourners, and here the widow and other relatives and friends of the deceased who had come from his late home near Bognor were awaiting the arrival of the funeral party. In addition to the ordinary number of seamen told off to attend the funeral, several petty officers and seamen volunteered to attend and pay a last tribute of respect to one of their number, and it is hardly necessary to say their request was granted. One of the men who thus attended-Lawton, captain of the forecastle of the Thunderer-was an old shipmate of the deceased. After the men had been drawn up they were allowed to break off for a few moments and take a farewell look of the deceased before the coffin was finally closed. The large majority of the party availed themselves of the opportunity. The deceased was a fine, stalwart fellow-a splendid specimen of a British sailor-and was about 30 years of age. Although he had been dead more than a week there was little change perceptible, and there was no trace of suffering stamped on his features. On the contrary, his face bore a tranquil and placid expression, which it was somewhat difficult to associate with the harrowing nature of the terrible event which had such a fatal ending. A number of flowers had been tastefully arranged around the head of the dead man. The coffin was a stained deal one, studded with black nails, and the breast-plate bore the following inscription:—

R. I. P.  
GEORGE ANDREW BENNETT, P.O.,  
Captain of the Quarter-deck, H.M.S. Eurydice,  
Drowned by the capsizing of that ship off Dunnose,  
March 24th, 1878.

A Union Jack formed the pall, and the coffin was carried to the hearse by six blue-jackets. For some reason the corpse was not conveyed on a gun-carriage, as is usual in naval funerals. The cortege was headed by the firing party of marines, with arms reversed. There was no band, it being understood that the widow did not desire one. Next came the hearse, behind which followed, on foot, the widow of the deceased, his sister, brother-in-law, and a few other relatives and friends of the deceased, including two Petty Officers-Jones and Evans-from the Osborne. Then followed the detachments of the crews of the Duke of Wellington, Asia and Thunderer, numbering altogether about 170.

H. SUIT1H said: The amount of ballast in the I hadno'rpydice when she left England was thirty tons. There inside ,vqs no reason to suppose any wa8 removed abroad. The I of a angles of maximum and vanishing stability were not as- cicesi, certained. The hammocks were not made buoyant. There ais reason to believe the usual establishment of lifc-belts three was on board, viz., ten per cent. of the complement, or le the about thirty life-belts. Cork mattresses and waterproof d the sheets have been tried, and have proved unsatisfactory on various points. The men do not like them, moreover. I acon- may add that it would have been impossible to get them r easy out of the hammock nettings in time in the sudden die- h the aster which befel the ERrydice. It is the intention of the pre- Admiralty to direct a complete and searching inquiry into o the loss of the ship in the form of a court-martial upon the "a of survivors. (Hear, hear.) nine THE, PLAN FOR RAISING THE WRECK. twken, The mode intended to be adopted by the Admiralty 11 was officials for raising the wreck is to lash the Pearl and the Rinal o to the wreck by means of massive chains, The esom ?? is a screw corvette, 2187 tons, 1300 horsepower. itil 11 Stout shores, about 8ft. in length, are to be hung on the being outside ports of these vessels for lashing the outer purchase sarch, blocks, and they have been specially ballasted, so as to enable them to resist the pressure which the raising of the tin ship will throw on their top sides. At low water these day's vessels will be lashed to the wreck, one on either side, and Ig-sail as the tide rises she will be gradually lifted and drawn 4 feettoward the shore, the chains being tightened each tide. feet ot half-a-dozen of these lifts wvill probably be sutficient Ig the to bring the vessel as far up the beach as to enable the away workmen to get the pumps at work while the tide is out, ed to and in about a couple of hours it is thought that sufficient wiater can be puinped'out of the vessel to enable her to rise use with the tide and once more ride on the breast of the sea. naces' The work of preparing the two vessels for the task has been o also rapidly pushed forward. Yesterday morning one of then, was the 1re,1/, was brought alongside the Dockyard. It is in- tended that she shall be sent to the wreck to-day (Wednes- hings day). The interior of the vessel has been fitted up so as to )ur in accommodate-the men who will be engaged at the work, Dock- so that it will not be necessary for them to leave the spot s and until the completion of the operations to lift the ship. While the two ships are being got ready in the Dockyard tll' to lift the Ear qoudice and float her into harbour, expel ibuents her have been made in the Dockyard with four models oaf ves- I the els, with the purpose of deteriining the best method of ition swinging the ship. One of the methods practiced wa sung- gested by Mr. Brewver, the mate of the Carnpce dolen, coal head hulk. ;eady ' MISCELLANEOUS. their On Friday, the 1 2th, a performance will be given at the Theatre Royal, in aid of the Relief Feud, when several con- well-known aau s wil appear. On Friday evening and ill he Saturday afternoon next, perfornicisces will be given at with the Portland Hall, by the Th'Audecrer Minstrels, the pro- as of ceeds beingr devoted to the Relief Fund. With regard to the sad loss of life in the Z. Frt flce' it is eurious to note that the schooner whose crew picked up a wind few of the drowniiig men carried no brandy or stimulants lone. whatever on board. It is most strange that thone who 3 too seek their fortune upon the deep waters should not slwvays carry such necessary articles in the medicine and chest, be the captain and crew teetotallers for ever- ly to Pictorial IVorld. Sad as all the cases of bereaved parents an] other rela- tives of those on board the EIurydice are, there are some felw which arc inexpressibly so, noticeable amougst them and being that of a poor woman who lost one son in the tilor, 01pthsinl, n second through the explosion on board the T kwadercr, and now a third through the foundering of the EItrydice. The Admiralty has decided that Benjamin Cuddiford, G. A.B., and the other survivor from the lost JAs;'udice was shall be formally brought to trial by Court-Martial, in rred order that the whole circumstances of the case, as far as ;din- can be gathered from their evidence and that of the i1is-divers who have been working on the ship, shall be 'hich sifted, with the view to decide whether the ship was nod, sufficiently ballasted and properly handled.

Writing from Ventnor our correspondent says that the is a subscriptions to the .Eumrydice Relief Fund are flowing in r as rapidly, and a handsome sumn will be sent to the Ports- and mouth Committee. The large amount of 701. was collected in a few hours by the Chief Officer of the Coastguard in of the little village of St. Lawrence, and a very influential and committee has been appointed. Mr. J. G. Livesay ome (honorary secretary) is, working very earnestly in the eral matter, and his efforts are rewarded with success, the list men being headed by two subscriptions of 20 guineas each from Miss Bligh, of Torwood, and J. Snowden-Henry, Esq., and respectively. On Sunday special collections were niade in e of the various places of worship in the town in aid of the sary Fund, which were all crowded ?? congregations. The sermons generally containe some special reference to who the recent catastrophe, and very earnest and eloquent the appeals ere made for the widows and relatives of the fter crew. Especially was this the case at the Congregational oakChurch, which was crowded both morning and evening, the Rev.Mr. Davies, the pastor, being the minister who the visited the survivors, Cuddiford and Fletcher, after the irge capsizing of the frigate. On Sunday a large number of por- persons visited the neighbourhood of the wreck from all parts of the Island. Two boys on Sunday afternoon -a picked up a sailor's straw ?? the Esrdke'e name wvas en the ribbon, and masleed inside "G.

Secretary to the Ventnor hat Committee, writes to the Tiiese:-Will you allow me to the make a proposal through the ubiquitous columns of the hei~nes which, if adopted, will bring a large accession to er th fund now being raised for the widows, orphans, and cad other dependent relatives of the brav e men wh am the me, nation has so grievously lost? It is that a simultaneous the collection be made on Saturday next by employers through- out the country in their offices, shops, factories, farmyards, workshops, & c. The builders in this town have promised me that they will make such an appeal to their hands, and I am sure that it will meet with a hearty response.

THE EURYDICE.

At Sandown Church, on Sunday. the Vicar, the Rev. G. S. Kerney. preached special and collections on behalf of the relatives were made, amounting to 3£50 1s. At Lake Mission Church  £3 10s. was collected.

Special sermons were preached at the Congregational Church, Ryde, and at Newport Parish Church on Sunday ; also at Portemouth, and other places.

The Lords of the Admiralty issued an order per yesterday (Tuesday) directing that a reward of £2 is to be paid for the recovery of each of the bodies of the unfortunate men lost in the Eurydice, and the whole of the funeral expenses will be borne by the Admiralty.

The weather has prevented more being done to the Eurydice during the past week.

The Mansion House fund for the relief of the sufferers now amounts to about £1,000. It bee been pointed out that the Eurydice was a training ship fur ordinary seamen, not boys.

The *Field* gives its reasons for believing that Capt. Hare was bringing his vessel up Channel with the ordinary caution of a seaman, but scarcely with a full apprehension of what might be the outcome of the squally appearance of the sky. He began in time to make snug for hauling on a wind with a freshening breeze. When he found the wind freshened faster than presaged good, he ordered sail to be shortened by furling the royals. Before this could be carried out the ship was struck by a heavy squall, and ere an attempt was made to put her before the wind she was knocked down on her side, and, her ports being open, she filled rapidly with water, and went to the bottom. Thus the Eurydice was thrown on her beam ends because she was struck by a squall, and because she was not run off the ' wind before she got the full weight of it. She heeled so rapidly to such an extreme angle because her lee ports were open, and she sank so suddenly from the same cause. Of course it has been asked if it was a prudent thing to sail with the lee ports open. As events turned out, it undoubtedly proved to be a very imprudent thing ; but no blame can be attached to Capt. Hare for this. It is customary to have the ports open under such conditions- they propably would have been closed when the vessel was braced up after clearing Dunnose ; and if the ports were never opened because a ship might under the influence of a sudden squall, put her port sills under, it would show an excess of caution equal to that of a man who bought a steam launch, but never lighted up because he was afraid the boiler might burst.

A complete and searching enquiry into the lose of the ship is to be be made in the shape of a Court Martial.

No more bodies have been recovered.

The midship section of the ship shows that the ports were just upon 6ft. above the water-line, and that the comparatively small heel of 18 deg. would bring the ports under water and prevent the vessel righting.

A correspondent of the *Devenport Independent* writes:- There are many distressing cases of bereavement and suffering here. In one a poor woman in Devonport, who lost a father, mother, and two children in 14 months, actually left the town early on Monday morning to be in Portsmouth to receive her husband, and only learnt the harrowing news on the road, when she returned a widow. In another case a young woman went round to be married to one of the young men ; she has been brought hack in such a condition, from shock sustained to the system, that her life is despaired of. A third case is that of a poor woman in Devonport, who, four months ago lost her husband in the Narcissus ; whilst her husband was in that ship she lost and buried seven children; and in the Eurydice had lost her only remaining child and her only support. A hardhearted act has oome to my knowledge concerning this poor woman. She is fortunately entitled to £17 for the back pay of her deceased husband, and on Monday she went to a certain clergyman—a curate—and asked him to sign a certificate of her marriage, in order to get the money. Notwithstanding that she explained to him the distressing circumstance in which she was paced, he demanded 2s. 6d. of her. She told him that she had not got the money, whereupon he refused his signature without the fee. The poor woman was obliged to borrow the money, which she obtained through a friend. Returning to the clergyman she *purchased* the certificate, but it was necessary for her to remind the rev. gentleman that he had to give her 6d. change to the 3s. she had tendered in payment! "And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover a multitude of sins."

A correspondent of the *Times* rises draws attention to the coincidence that a somewhat similar fate, under somewhat similar circumstances- for it was almost within sight of her destination — befel the Eurydice's ill-fated consort ship 15 years ago—the Orpheus. In classic tale Eurydice was the wife of Orpheus. The Orpheus was entering the Manukan harbour, near Auckland, on a fine Saturday afternoon in February or March, 1863. Mistaking the channel she struck on the bar, about 40 only being saved.

The brig Romulus, which weathered the storm in which the Eurydice foundered, has arrived from Wales at Dover, and her master, Capt. Stephens, reports his own observation of the squall which proved so disastrous. At the time its occurrence he was about 12 miles astern of the Eurydice, off the Isle of Wight, and noting a fall in the barometer, accompanied by an unusual outcast appearance of the sky, which seemed most threatening, ordered sail to be shortened, and the hands ready to the haulyards in case of emergency. It was not long before the storm observed on the horizon suddenly swept down with all its might upon the ship, with a roar almost deafening. At the order "Let go" from the captain, the haulyards were released, and the sheets loosened until the hurricane had moderated, and the Romulus proceeded arriving safely at 9 p.m. at Dover. Capt. Stephens was of course ignorant of the awful calamity that had happened on his path, and regrets he did not make the other side of the island, as he might have been enabled, like the Emma, to have saved some of the Eurydice's crew.

THE loss of the *Eurydice* is a national calamity. In some terrible respect the catastrophe of the *Captain* has been repeated. Both ships were caught in sudden squalls near the coast— Spain in one mum, England in the other— and both foundering, drowning nearly all on board. At the same time, as thousands of ships, great and small, are continually caught in squalls, and very few indeed founder when there is sea-room, we must suppose that the fatal result is due, as it was in the case of the *Captain*, to some radical defect in the vessel's trim. We have now lost about a thousand of our sailors from a cause which imperatively demands exhaustive analysis.— *Brief*.

The *Hornet* says:—"Eurydice is an unlucky name. One Eurydice hanged herself, another died of a serpent bite, and now a third goes to the depths in sight of the shores of the land from which she had long been absent."

"It may interest some of your readers to know that the snow-storm of the 24th of March struck the Worcester end of the Malvern-hills from the north-west at 1 p.m., as the Priory church clock struck. It took threequarters of an hour to clear this end of the range. It travelled in a south-east direction, and arrived at the supposed position of the Eurydice, off the Isle of Wight, at 4.30 p.m. Its appearance was that of a 'white wall' bulging forward. There was no haze between my position and the advancing white wall, the distance of which I judged to be two and a half or three miles. With me it was sunshine ; I had not got 100 yards on my way down the hill when the storm overtook me. It travelled at a rate of 35 miles an hour, or a mile in less than two minutes. Assuming the distance to Dunnose, as the crow flies, to be 115 miles, the rate the storm travelled would be 32.7 miles an hour. The time the rear edge took to clear Malvern was three quarters of an hour; this would give a length of cloud 24.5 miles. Any one standing near an express train going at forty miles an hour knows the current which is produced, and, therefore, cannot be surprised at the enormous pressure a compact mass of cloud 24 1/2 miles long will exert on the place over which it passes at a rate of a mile in less than two minutes. As the mass of cloud was moving from N.W. to S.E. its length has been spoken of ; what its breadth may have been must remain unknown."

THE LOSS OF THE "EURYDICE."

A-message from the Queen has been forwarded by the Admiralty to the relatives of the officers who were lost in the Eurydice, together with a letter conveying an expression of their lordships' deep regret at the sad event.

On Friday morning a pilot lugger sailed into Portsmouth, and handed over to the Commander-in- Chief a sail, a boat's awning, a bucket, several other pieces of wreckage, and four caps, two of which bore the ribband of the Eurydice, which had been picked up about 20 miles to the westward of the place where the ship went down.

On Friday the Lord Mayor received from Captain J. C. Wilson, A.D.C. of the Thunderer, a communication conveying to him, on behalf of the Portsmouth Committee, an expression of their deep sense of his kindness in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Eurydice, and gratefully accepting his offer. In the afternoon, also, Lord Charles Beresford, M.P , waited upon the Lord Mayor, and personally tendered him the thanks of the naval authorities at Portsmouth for the promptness of his assistance, which was much appreciated. The following appeal has been issued from the Mansion House on the subject: " The Lord Mayor, at the desire of the naval authorities at Portsmouth, will most gladly receive at the Mansion House donations for the support of the widows, orphans, dependents, and relatives of the crew of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, which sank off the Isle of Wight with nearly all hands on Sunday last. The loss of a gallant crew of over 300 young British sailors, within sight of home and in such distressing and appalling circumstances, has created a deep feeling of sorrow throughout the country. It has been thought that the sympathy of the public in this disaster cannot be better or more practically shown than by affording aid to those bereaved relatives whose only means of support has been cut off so suddenly and sadly. Tne Portsmouth Committee are obtaining details of the number of widows, children, aged parents, and others rendered destitute by the calamity. The Lord Mayor meanwhile appeals to his fellow citizens and the public at large for donations for the relief of these sufferers, and he hopes that the response may be such as to enable him to remit a very handsome sum to the local committee at Portsmouth, with whom he is in direct communication."

Saturday and Monday were blank days, so far as the clearing of the wreck of the Eurydice was concerned. The wind blew strongly and coldly from the north, and the dockyard tugs did not leave their moorings. During the previous day the Dromedary, which had been anchored near the scene of the wreck as a lightship, was obliged, in consequence of the violence of the weather, to slip her cables and make for Portland, where she arrived safely on Saturday morning. While the two ships are being got ready in the dockyard to lift the Eurydice and float her into harbour, experiments have been made in the yard with four models of vessels, with the purpose of determining the best method of swinging the ship. One of the methods practised was suggested by Captain Brewer, the mate of the Camperdown steamer. Captain Coppin, who succeeded in raising the Alpheta from Bembridge Ledge a few weeks ago, has also offered his services, but he has been informed that the dockyard authorities will themselves conduct the operations. The Rinaldo is not only being prepared to float the ship, but is being fitted with sleeping accommodation for the riggers and divers, to remove the necessity of their leaving the ship.

The more the matter of the foundering of the training ship is discussed the more necessary seems the holding of a naval inquiry, for the purpose of clearing up questions which were not submitted to the jury at Ventnor, and which only a court of professional and scientific experts will be able to fully appreciate. With reference, indeed, to one very important point, the jury were clearly misinformed. The boy Fletcher, from what he had heard among his mess-mates, was under the impression that the ballast of the ship was principally composed of the water which was stored below for drinking and cooking purposes, and of the usual stores of the ship. At the end of the voyage, of course, the weight of the water and stores would bo much diminished, and ; hence, had they constituted the main ballast of the Eurydice, her stability would have been greatly affected by their exhaustion. To rebut this evidence, the able seaman, Cuddiford, was recalled by the Admiralty agent, and he said that the ship had the proper amount of ballast for her tonnage, and that the lower tier of water-tanks was never disturbed. This was considered satisfactory by the jury, but it has been since discovered from drawings now in the possession of the Admiral Superintendent that the ship was not fitted with a second tier of tanks. It is not, however, believed by professional persons at Portsmouth that the reduction in the weight of water ana stores would seriously lessen the stability of the ship. The utmost difference which the loss during the voyage would make in the draught of the Eurydice would be about eight or ten inches, the only practical result of which would be to make her a little more " lively." In order to clear up the question of the amount of water in the ship at the time of foundering, Admiral Foley has instructed the divers to measure the contents of the tanks as soon as they are reached ; but as they are not water-tight, and will have been filled with sea water, it is not considered likely that their present condition will afford any guidance as to their state on Suuday, the 24th ult. The midship section of the ship also shows that the ports were just upon 6ft. above the water-line, and that the comparatively small heel of 18' would briug the ports under water aud prevent the vessel righting.

On Sunday, at Portsmouth, reference was made to the sudden calamity in most of the pulpits, and in several of the churches collections were made on behalf of the friends and relatives of the seamen.

On Saturday afternoon the remains of Captain J. G. L. Ferrier, R.E., of Bellside, Linlithgowshire, who was drowned by the sinking of the Eurydice, were interred with military honours in Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh. Detachments of the 50th Regiment, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and the Royal Artillery took part in the procession. The streets along the route were crowded with spectators.

The remains of Lieutenaut Tabor, which, after the inquest at Ventnor, were conveyed to Cheam, Surrey, the residence of his family, were interred in Cheam Churchyard on Friday afternoon. The corpse was followed by the Rev. R S. Tabor, the father, aud the brother and sister of the deceased, Mrs Tabor, the wife of the gallant officer, being present at the church and grave. The coffin was covered by the Union Jack, a fitting pull, flowers forming a cross, and *immortelles*. The service, which was partly choral, was conducted by the rector, the Rev. C. H. Rice, assisted by several other clergymen. Despite the terrible weather, a large number of persons were present, comprising many of the resident gentry. Captain Fellowes, of the Royal Naval College, re-presented the Admiralty.

The remains of George Arthur Bennett were interred in the cemetery at Haslar, close by the spot at which the victims of the explosion on board the Thunderer were buried. The fuueral was a very quiet affair. No band attended, but a firing party of Marines, and a number of blue-jackets who had volunteered from the various ships in harbour, were present. The spectators were very few. The servioe was conducted by the Rev. Mr. Nickolby, chaplain to the hospital.

At a meeting of the Middlesex District Lodge of Good Templars, on Saturday evening, the Rev. E. Schnadhorst, district chaplain, referred to the loss of the Eurydice, and to the fact that one of the Naval Lodges belonging to the Order had gone down with the ill-fated vessel. A resolution was unanimously adopted, expressing sorrow at the foundering of the Eurydice, and the entire loss of a lodge of Good Templars working under the title of the " Decoy Bird," and sympathy with the relatives of the deceased.

In the House of Commons, on Monday, Mr. W. H. Smith, in reply to Captain Price, stated that the amount of ballast in Her Majesty's ship Eurydice when she left England was 30 tons, the amount she had always carried, and there was no reason to believe any was removed. It was the intention of the Admiralty to direct a complete enquiry into the loss of the ship.

A writer in the Field (Mr. Henry Ligg) says: " It is often remarked that history repeats itself ; unhappily, in this melancholy case it is so, for this ship is the second Her Majesty has lost from a similar cause within sight of the same spot. Her Majesty's schooner Pincher, Lieutenant T. Hope commander, sailed from Sheerness for Portsmouth on Sunday, March 4, 1838, in company with H.M.'s frigate Volage, 28 guns, Captain H. Smith. On the following Tuesday afternoon, between 4 and 5 p.m., the schooner was observed standing in for the Isle of Wight to windward of the Volage ; the weather fine, but the wind at times squally. The two ships were working towards Spithead. It is supposed, for no one is alive to tell the tale, that a squall caught the schooner, threw her on her beam-ends, and, having a press of sail set, and a heavy gun amidships, with boats, soars, &c., on deck, she never righted, and all on board, about 35 souls, were instantly drowned. It is also said that when the Vol tge missed her, she made exertions to discover where she was ; and that, it being then dark, a blue light was burnt and a gun fired to denote her position, in case any of the unfortunate people should be able to get to her ; but beyond that nothing was done, for the Volage made the best of her way to Spithead, without keeping the sea all night and at the dawn of day causing a look-out to be kept for the wreck. It is also asserted that not until the following Saturday, in consequence of the rumours prevailing of the loss of the schooner, was any inquiry or investigation made, and then a sort of gossip was held at the Port Admiral's office about her and her unfortunate crew. However, on Monday, the 12th — five days afterwards— two Cowes pilots called on the Port Admiral to state that they had seen the crutch of the mainboom of a vessel, supposed to belong to a man-of-war, floating about four miles and a half S.S. W. of the Owers light-vessel ; and the second Master Attendant of the dockyard, having been despatched early on Tuesday morniug — a week after the accident — ascertained that the wreck of the Pincher was lying in about 14 fathoms of water, on her larboard broadside, with all sails set, and her head S.W. Measures were immediately taken to weigh her, but without success, in consequence of the tempestuous state of the weather and the heavy sea on the spot, and all returned to port. After several failures, it was not until June that the officers of Portsmouth succeeded in raising her and towing her into the harbour. A coroner's inquest was held on ten of the bodies found on board, and a verdict returned, "Found dead on board the Pincher from suffocation, supposed to be caused by the over-setting of the vessel near the Owers Light." The Eurydice and the Modiste were the construction of Admiral Elliott, C.B., and were different in two important elements of safety to any other vessels of their size in our own or the French navy. Of the Modiste, the Plymouth correspondent of the *United Service Journal* writes under date 20th of October, 1838 : - I fear I should fail in the attempt if I were to endeavour to describe to you the minute peculiarities of the Modiste. It may however be remarked, in a general way, that she appears higher above the water than other ships of her class, and draws less water.' Of the Eurydice, the First Lord of the Admiralty stated in the House of Commons that the ship was 921 tons (about the same as the Modiste ; was built by Admiral Elliott ; that she carried in the place of her old 26 guns two 64-pounder guns ; that she carried the same ballast as in former commissions, and 117 tons of water as against 102 tons ; that her draught of water was 16ft. 6in. I may remark that I once owned a very fast merchant ship, of the highest class at Lloyd's, 341 tons, and she drew 16ft. 6in. when in her best sailing trim ; and that our largest cutter yacht, of 111 registered tons, draws 14ft. This small draught of water is less by about 4ft. than is usual in vessels betweeii 900 and 1000 tons, which, coupled with greater height out of water, aud the fact that both the ballasting power of the provisions and water for 300 men in a voyage across the Atlantic must have been materially reduced, are, I think, reasons why this fine ship should not recover herself when struck by so exceptionally sudden and so unusually heavy a squall, before any amount of human sharpness and skill could reduce the canvas, which was by no means in excess of what any seaman in the world, in such a ship, would carry under similar circumstances of fair wind and the fine weather that had prevailed all day until a few moments before the awful catastrophe, which the whole world will never cease to deplore."

A correspondent of the *Devonport Independent* writes : " I shall never forget the morning on which the news of the loss of the Eurydice was received in Devonport. The effect was truly awful. It seemed as if the Pagan demon Terror himself had made his appearance among the people. The hearts of men and women alike were stilled with affright and their tongues stricken dumb with pain. In such times of great calamity, and especially wheu that calamity is fearfully near us, the thoughts of most men mysteriously take a religious tone — are arrested by a deep and solemn conviction of the working of an Almighty and impenetrable Power above and beyond them. So it was with not a few persons in Devonport on Monday morning. There are many distressing cases of bereavement and suffering. In one a poor woman in Devonport, who lost a father, mother, and two children in 14 months, actually left the town eirly on Monday morning to be in Portsmouth to receive her husband, and only learnt the harrowing news on the road, when she returned a widow. In another case a young woman went round to be married to one of the young men ; she has been brought back in such a condition, from shock sustained to the system, that her life is despaired of. A third case is that of a poor woman in Devonport, who, four months ago, lost her husband in the Narcissus : whilst her husband was in that ship she lost aud buried seven children ; and in the Eurydice has lost her only remaining child and only support. A hard-hearted act has come to my knowledge concerning this poor woman. She is fortunately entitled to £17 for the back pay of her deceased husband, and on Monday she went to a certain clergyman — a curate — and asked him to sign a certificate of her marriage, in order to get the money. Notwithstanding that she explained to him the distressing circum- stances in which she was placed, he demanded 2s. 6d. of her. She told him that she had not got the money, whereupon he refused his signature without the fee. The poor woman was obliged to borrow the money, which she obtained through a friend. Returning to the clergymen she *purchased* the certificate, but it was necessary for her to remind the rev. gentleman that he had to give her 6d. change to the 3s. she had tendered in payment ! ' And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.'  I am glad to learn, and the public will be equally so, that immediately after the catastrophe Mr. Metham resoived to mitigate its grievous effects by opening to at least some of the bereaved f amilies the orphan refuge of the magnificent institution over which he presides, of which he is the very life and soul, and which is one of the finest testimonies to a loving sympathy and to a broad-hearted chariy that any nation ever possessed. An election of orphan girls to the Royal Female Orphan Asylum takes place in a week or two hence, but a special effort will be made to meet this exceptional and bitter trouble. Well done ! The crown of charity is the richest and brightest crown of all: charity to the orphan is the most Divinely blessed charity of all."

Mr. J. G. Livesay, writing to the *Times* from Ventnor, says : " Will you allow me to make a proposal through the ubiquitous columns of the Times, which, if adopted, will bring a large accession to the fund now being raised for the widows, orphans, and other dependent relatives of the brave men whom the nation has so grievously lost? It is that a simultaneous collection be made on Saturday next by employers throughout the country in their offices, shops, factories, farmyards, workshops, etc. The builders in this town have promised me that they will make such an appeal to their hands, and I am sure that it will meet with a hearty response. I believe there are few working men in the British Isles who would not on such an occasion cheerfully give a quarter or half of a day's pay, according as the circumstances of their own families might permit. The head of every household should ask each of his servants for a trifle, and even our cliildren may give their penny and upwards. A very erroneous impression is abroad, even here on the scene of the catastrophe, as to the probable number of persons who will require relief. Because the Eurydice was a training ship it has been assumed that nearly all her crew would be very young and unmarried But she was a training ship for ordinary seamen, not boys, and I have just been informed on good authority that a much larger proportion of the crew were married than had been supposed. Let no one be afraid of giving too much. Even if there should be a surplus after providing for the present sufferers, it might form a valuable reserve fund for similar cases in the future, just as the large surplus of the Hartley Colliery Explosion Fund has proved so useful for other contingencies of its kind."

A correspondent to the *Globe* writes : " The loss of the Eurydice has called attentiou to a matter of no little importance, affecting as it does the welfare of seamen. It appears that the master of the Emma the schooner which rescued the five survivors of the sunken vessel, when he got the men on board, could not apply the usual restoratives because his was what is known as a 'temperance craft.' That is to say, the Emma did not carry any stimulants for her crew, and, what is still more serious, the medicine chest contained neither brandy nor any kind of spirits. From these facts it appears urgently necessary for the Board of Trade to take immediate steps to prevent such omissions in future ; for, however desirable it may be to keep a crew sober, the indio- syncracies of the master of a vessel should not be allowed unnecessarily to imperil the lives of his crew, or of any one. In the present instance, if some brandy could have been procured on board the Emma, it is probable that the lives of more than two out of the five persons rescued from the Eurydice might have been saved. It will surprise many peo- ple to learn that from a mistaken notion of the necessity of protesting against alcohol drinking in any form the masters of some of our merchant vessels aro seriously endangering human life. A delay of half an hour, as in the present case, may, and probably will, cause death after such exposure as the five survivors of the Eurydice had experienced. Under the circumstances every one, whether a total abstainer or not, must lament this sad example of too much temperance."

Another correspondent to the *Globe* writes : "It seems a strange coincidence in naval nomenclature that both the Orpheus and the Eurydice, almost in sight of port, under full sail on a Sunday afternoon, should have been wrecked with a loss of almost all hands on board. I do not for a moment imagine that either of these melancholy events has any direct reference to the other, but the connection in name aud the similarity of many circumstances attending their fate strikes me as being at least passing strange. H.M.S. Orpheus was lost at Manakau Head, outside the harbour at Auckland, on Saturday, February 7, 1863.

The following extract from " Hollinshed's Chronicles" may be of interest: " *The Loss of the Mary Rose.* — .. . After this, 18 Julie, 1545, the Admirall of France, Monsieur Danabutte, hoised up sailes, and with his whole navie came forth into the seas, and arrived on the coast of Sussex before bright Hampstead, and set certaine of his soldiers on land to burne and spoile the countrie. . . . Immediatelie hereupon they made to the point of the Ile of Wight, called Saint Helens Point, and there in good order upon their arrivall they cast anchor and dailie sent sixteen of their gallice to the verie haven of Portesmouth. . . . The twentieth of Julie the whole navie of the Englishmen made out, and purposed to set on the Frenchmen, but in setting forward, through too much folly, one of the King's ships, called the Mary Rose, was drowned in the midst of the haven, by reason that she was overladen with ordinance, and had the ports left open, which were verie low, and the great artillerie unbreached, so that when the ship should turne, the water entered, and suddenly she suncke. In her was Sir George Garew, Knight, and foure hundred soldiers under his guiding. There escaped not past fortie persons of the whole number."

The Eurydice

So far as we have been able to ascertain — and sounding very, very many, we have not met with a contrary opinion – Islanders are anything but satisfied with the verdict of the Ventnor Jury. Of course they agree with the former portion – that the unfortunate met met with their death by capsizing of the vessel during a squall; but they differ as to the latter– that no blame attaches to anyone aboard. – The boy Fletcher proven to have been the nearest to the truth after all – though Cuddeford was recalled by the Admiralty law agent of Portsmouth to rebut his words– in saying that the ballast of the ill-fated vessel wa her water and stores (both for use), and these lessened on the voyage. Cuddeford said the lower tier of tanks were never touched, but the fact is there was no lower tier ! and the crew using from the only tanks below lightened the ship. However, this ballast question to our mind is not the most serious one. We believe most persons are firmly of opinion that the ports ought not to have been open, and that so much sail ought not to have been carried, under the circumstances. The ports being only 6ft. above water it will be seen that a comparatively slight heel over -18 degrees only— would bring them under water. Of course they should be open in fine weather and when there is no probability of bad weather— but in this case there was more than a probablility of bad weather- no-one could tell *how* bad, and wisdom and ordinary caution must have dictated their closing. The port question is a more serious one than that of water ballast, but a more important one still is the question of sail. Old, experienced seamen at Ventnor, remarked to one another as the Eurydice passed that she was carrying too much sail and would have to shorten directly— *they* could see that something bad was coming, and this most have been seen by the officers, *before* they came to the Culver shield, which has been made to shield them. We had newspaper warning that a storm might be expected on or about this day— we de not know whether this intimation was conveyed to the officers by signal or not, but we do know that the barometer had fallen rapidly, indicating something sudden and sharp, and we do know that another warning was given in the clouds some time before the storm broke on the vessel– before she passed Ventnor and came to the "shield."— There was no doubt an intense desire to get home— to the home within sight, and, being so close home, the dangers of the sea might *seem* to have been passed. " Fly on my boys, she'll stand it" would seem to have been the mental utterance— and there might have been a race on for a bet between this and a certain other vessel, when one would strain a point and run a risk, thought not certainly and knowingly run over risk to death. We give what the opinion at Ventnor was as she passed, and we must think that ordinary prudence and caution would have said–  never mind a few minutes, never mind a £5O bet (supposing this to have been lain) the barometer has fallen and the sky is threatening— one doesn't know *how much* these portend— it be be safer to close the ports and take in some little of the extra sail. The ports were not closed, and it was not attempted to reef till the full force of the squall was upon them and it was too late. It occurs to us that the fact of the ports being open may have been for the  nonce *forgotten*, with thoughts of home, and so on, and a belief the sail would "stand the storm" enabling them to anchor "by and by". No doubt sail ought to have been taken in and ports closed half-an-hour or an hour before, but we believe that had the ports only been closed, and had the vessel continued to carry her every stitch she would have righted, for according to Cuddeford she encountered a far heavier gale in the Bay of Biscay, and was "lively." As we say a comparatively slight list brought the ports under water, and then tons of water pouring in were auxiliaries to the squall, and the tin effected their terribly fatal work. The captain d the "Emma " did not shorten sail till the squall was on him, but he had *no ports open*, and had not been  carrying so much canvas. We believe the Eurydice would never have gone down had the warning of Providence and science been heeded. We class the calamity as a *preventible* one, and should write more strongly on the matter but for the words *"De mortuis nil nisi bonum."* Still, when we find one after another of our ships going down— may not the ships but about a thousand of our men– supposed to be commended by the cream of seamen— when we lose these at times when other seamen clse by are not lost, the interests of the country and of the relatives of our naval men demand that the press shall speak out and insist that the matter be not only fully enquired into, but that stringent orders be given that the officers shall run no risks, that ships shall be late, and that orders shall be disobeyed even rather than this losing game shall no longer continue. There is something radically wrong in our recent losses of ships and men. Whether naval men have become steamship hands and ceased to be *sailors* we cannot say, but certainly the matter demands the most minute enquiry, and more than that. Let us conclude with two quotations :

*Weekly Times.*– We fain would take a favourable view of the case. We are sure there will be a strict investigation into the catastrophe. This is due for the honour of the dead, as well as for the safety of our seamen afloat. We know how it came to pass that the *Captain* sank in the Bay_of Biscay; a poet has told us how the brave Kempenfelt, in the *Royal George*, "went down with twice four hundred mem." Did the *Eurydice* thus sink without any warning, or though the neglect of reasonable foresight? Did the barometer give no warnings, or were its warnings neglected because the ship was so near home?

*Vanity Fair*— We protest most emphatically against the qusetioes arising out of this catastrophe being treated as though it were a matter concerning only the reputation of the poor fellows who have gone down. The question is not that, but a far more grave and serious one— namely, whether the vessels in the Queen's service are to be handled in a prudent and seamanlike manner. We are convinced that the *Eurydice* was not so handled ; and to say that she was, in order to screen the memory the dead, or to spare the susceptibilities of the living, would be to give a public encouragement to carelessness and lubberliness not only in the Navy but in all other cases, and that at a time when those very defects are most seriously on the increase and likely to bring about disasters of greatly increased gravity.

THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

The Secretary of the Admiralty publishes tbe following copy of a memorandum received from the British steamship Badger, with regard to the state of the weather at the time of the loss of H.M.S. Eurydice, ou the 24th ult. : " London and Edinburgn Shipping Compauy, Bordeaux, Maich 28, 1878. Steamship Badger. — Sunday, March 24th,1878, about 3.30 p.m., St. Catherine's Point, about N.N. W. five miles, passed one of H.M. ships on our port side. She was then under ail sail, topmast and lower studding sails on the port side, the wind being about W. by N., fresh breeze and fine weather. The weather had been fine all day ; wind westerly, shifting from W.S.W. to W.N.W. Passed St. Catherine's Point N.N.E. two miles, at 3.45 p.m. Then observed dark, heavy clouds to the north-west. About 4 p.m. the wind shifted suddenly to N. N. W., blowing strong, with snow, and continued about half-an-hour. I believe that the appearace of a squall coming on couid not be seen from Her Majesty's ship. I did not see it until clear of  St. Catherine's Point. It was low down, and clear over head, and also clear over Isle of Wight. Therefore Her Majesty's ship would get the squall without any warning. — (signed) -Jno. Louttit."

The *Globe* points out that this statement goes some way to lessen the responsibility of those on board the Eurydice for the loss of that vessel in comparatively fine weather. Two facts of importance are now in evidence. First, that, owing to the high land on the weather quarter of the Eurydice, the squall could not well have been seen from the deck of the fine old frigate until it was fairly upon her. In the second place, the surmise that there must have been a sudden change of wind is now corroborated, the master of the Badger staring that it shifted just about 4 o'clock from west by north to north-west. This change must have nearly or quite taken the ill-fated vessel aback, thus creating considerable confusion at the very moment when it had become supremely necessary to furl sail with the utmost expedition. So far, then, this new evidence tends towards the exoneration of Capt. Hare, but it still remains to be explained how he came not only to carry a heavy press of canvas, but to keep his lee ports open, when the barometer had been distinctly indicating bad weather for many previous hours. The record of the Badger says "the weather had been fine all day, wind unsteady," a state of things which, in conjunction with barometrical j warning's, might have been expected to inspire some caution about carrying on. Ihere is one discrepancy, however, between what was observed from the deck of the merchant steamer and what Cuddiford saw before the squall broke. Capt. Louttit deposed that "it was clear over head and also over the Isle of Wight ; " whilst Cuddiford gave it in evidence "that he saw a dark cloud coming over the land." This, however, was only at the last moment, a few seconds before the squall burst on the Eurydice ; and it does not, therefore, refute the suggestion made by Capt. Louttit that the gust struck the training ship withoat warning.

On Saturday the Camel, tug, proceeded out of harbour, and cruised about the Eurydice looking for bodies or wreckage, but returned into harbour without having found anything. On Sunday a violent gale blew from the eastward, compelling the Dromedary, lighter, to slip her anchors aud go out to sea, but when the wina abated she was able to return and succeeded in recovering her moorings. On Monday there was a stiff breeze from the south-east, which prevented the executioun of arrangements made for the towing of the Pearl to her position near the wreck. During the day several articles of clothing belonging to the crew washed ashore, and a number of sailors' serges, like those worn in the Royal Navy, were found floating at sea or were washed on the rock, all bearing names, amongst them being those of W. French, J. Keily, and H. Scull. A ship chest was likewise washed ashore between Luccombe and Shanklin, and was handed over to the authorities. As the clothes-lockers were used as mess seats on the lower deck, it is thought that this indicates some motion below, but, on the other hand, it is stated that the covers of the lockers were loosely attached, and would readily float open.

Alluding to the period that bas elapsed since the unfortunate vessel went down, the *Times* says; " Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed at the small progress which is made with the raising of the ship, and many naval men say that if the chain Cables were hauled the ship would be sufficiently lifted to enable a couple of tugs to drag her into shallow water, when the ports could be closed aud the water pumped out."

The *Army and Navy Gazette*  says: " Since the loss of the Eurydice the papers have been full of letters from correspondents telling their experience when : caught in a squall, and others advising the Admiralty as to the training of seamen. One states— though where he could obtain the information from is curious — that no more thau 15 per cent. of our sailors can swim. As far as the seaman class is concerned, this would appear to be erroneous, for in all the training ships there are swimming instructors and the boys are taken to the bathing vessels fitted on purpose to give every facility for learning the art of swimming and to ensure the saiety of the learners. Their lordships have not been unmindful of the advisability of having every boy taught to take care of himself if he gets out of his elememt, and the assertion of one correspondent that sailors thought it beneath their dignity to swim, as a horse soldier might object to walking is absurd. To be as much at home in the water as on his legs is a qualification by no means despised by the sailor, and he receives the admiration of his fellows for his skill as a swimmer and diver. What else but the keen competition and love of out-doing each other would otherwise tempt men to dive from the heights they not unfrequently do."

A correspondent of the *Whitehall Review* says: "I hear that the widuo of poor Captain Hare first heard of her sad loss when making the railway journey from the North to Portsmouth, whither she was hastening to meet her husband. Some people in the same carriage were expressing their regret at the loss of the Eurydice, of which they had just read in the papers, and thus the tidings of her terrible bereavement reached the ears of Mrs. Hare. She had every hope that her husband was saved, as the accident happened so near the land, and Capt. Hare was an excellent swimmer. Unhappily, however, that hope proved vain, aod it is clear that only men of exceptional constitutions could have stood the fearful effects of immersion for an hour or more in such bitter weather as set in with that terrible squall."

The *Geographical Magazine* for April pays the following tribute to the memory of one of the gallant seamen lost in the Eurydice: "We have to record the death of one of the gallant few which attained the highest Northern latitude ever reached by man, on the memorable 12th of May, 1876. Daniel Harley was born at Madras in 1849, he entered the Navy before the mast, was a seaman gunner, served in the Ashantee War, and was one of Commodore Commerell's gig crew when he was wounded. In May, 1875, he was selected for the Arctic Expedition, and became captain of the foretop of H.M.S. Alert. He was away autumn travelling from September 11th to 14th, and suffered severely from the gale of wind and intense cold. But he soon recovered, and was full of zeal for the spring travelling, when he formed one of Capt. Markham's sledge crew, in the northern division. Harley was one of the ten who planted the Union Jack in 83 degrees, 200 min. 26 sec/ Attacked by scurvy, he still continued to struggle against the insidious disease, resolute to do his duty until he dropped. When unable to drag, he refused to be put on the sledge, and managed to walk over the ground. Out of all that heroic band, none displayed higher qualities than poor Harley. On his return to England, he joined the Eurydice, as a first-class petty officer, and was drowned when that ill-fated vessel went down off the Isle of Wight, on March 24th, 1878. Daniel Harley was a fine specimen of a British seaman. He was married shortly before he sailed for the Arctic regions."

An idea of the cases im the three towns (ssys the *Western Morning News* may afford an illustration of what are likely to be the necessities of the fund generally. A personal visit to the majority of the cases has afforded some insight into the degree of loss sustained by those who were the most closely connected with the poor men who met death by this melancholy occurrence. The ship being a training frigate, the majority of the men were, as was to be expected, only 19 or 20 years of age, and it may perhaps be safe to take the Plymouth list as representing the general proportion of married to unmarried men. Three out of the 17 or 18 men who allotted their half-pay to relatives here were married ; but neither of them leaves a large family. The case of the widow of one of them is, however, peculiarly sad. She has experienced that  
"When sorrows come  
They come not single spies, but in battalions."  
Her father, her mother, and her child, and now, to fill up the cup of grief, her husband, have all been taken avay from her within a twelvemonth. One poor woman is just expecting a child, who will never have heard its father's voice. The other cases are nearly all those in which mothers have lost sons on whom they more or less depended. In one or two instances the bereavement is very hard. One poor woman, in particular, laments an only son, who was, as she puts it, " the only real help she had in the world," and whose half-pay it is very difficult to dispense with. Other cases there are in which one of two sons — jointly their mother's stay — has been taken. In every instance the loss is irreparable; the husbaud, the supporter and protector of his wife now made lonely ; the son, the help and hope of the mother now rendered desolate, feels — and, from personal knowledge in this case, we know feels keenly — the small compensation any sum of money can buy. But, hard as it is, that is the only compensation they can receive, and that should certainly be rendered willingly and freely.

The Rev. W. H. Redknapp, incumbent of St James's, Ryde, and hon. chaplain of the Missions to Seamen, sends the following extract from the journal of the missionary to seamen, which is under his superintendence, relative to the last moments of one of the officers who perished in the Eurydice: "March 25. I found that on boarding the Emma that the captain was gone on shore about the loss of the Eurydice. The mate related, with tears in his eyes, the sad sight which he witnessed yesterday afternoon. He said, ' I took the young officer up in my arms and as I was carrying him to the cabin the poor young fellow put his arms round my neck, and his face against mine, and I could not help giving him a kiss. I thought it was the last he would ever have. I wished he had lived. I tried very hard to revive him, but all my efforts failed.' "

The following lines (signed "F. G.") on the loss  of the Eurydice, appears in the *Baily's Magazine* for this month :

'Twas on a bright and breezy day  
A noble ship came sailing home,  
Dashing from either bow the spray,
And ploughs up the milk white foam.

For the last time the gallant band,  
Close to "Old England on the lee,"  
Had said their prayers for those on land  
Who asked God's aid for those at sea.

The sun is sinking towards the west,  
Tinging with gold the belying sail;
The sailors take their Sabbath rest,  
And laugh and tell the oft-told tale.

The sister's joy, the mother's bliss,  
The dream of meeting of old friends,  
Of tight grasped hand, of lover's kiss,  
For all their hard-ships make amends.

No cheery-hearted coastguard fails  
To point the ship to those who stand  
Around– whose prayers are in the sails  
Which waft her towards the friendly strand.

No wonder that the captain thought  
With honest hope and pride of soul,
To bring the good ship, "smart and taut,"  
Like a swifr racehorse to the goal.

Mid life and hope the thick black clouds  
Snow-filled that put the ship from view;
The fierce tornado strikes her shrouds,  
She's gone ! with all her home-bound crew.

The blood-red sun comes brightly back  
And lightens up the evening sky,  
And  paints what *was* the vessel's track,  
As if in empty mockery

Alas ! for skill of human mind!  
He from whom good and evil come,
Who rides upon the stormy wind,  
Took the three hundred wanderers Home.

Poetry - H.M.S. "EURYDICE," MARCH 24, 1878.

"Eurydice," twice-told, ill-fated name,  
The fullest agony of grief to claim.  
A bride beloved upon her marriage day  
Snatched ruthlessly by death's stern hand away.  
Not her adoring lover's destined bliss  
Was nearer consummation than was this  
Two oceans passed, and close at home once more  
Gazed at in rapture from old England's shore,  
With all sails set, beneath a sunny sky,  
Wind and tide favouring. What bliss is nigh !  
Nay it is well-nigh grasped, that " Welcome Home,"  
When the proud ship plunged into the tomb,  
As on the beauty of her out-spread wings  
The fatal blast in frenzied fury springs,  
Without a warning all those noble, brave  
Young throbbing hearts are silenced 'neath the wave  
Without a warning o'er the calm bright sea,  
A message called them to eternity.  
Nor Orpheus' self for his Eurydice  
Knew the wide sorrow that felt for thee.  
How many lives what love as true and strong,  
Will to their close the grief for thee prolong ?  
If Orpheus-like we fain would search the deep  
For thy dear treasures that -within it sleep,  
No power of wealth or talent can attain  
To bring the warm life gushing back again ;  
'Twould be a cold and shadowy ghost alone  
That could not for lost love and hope atone.  
But oh ! begone, ye mystic shadows dim,  
Let holier, brighter faith now point to Him !  
Sleep, loved ones; "Sleep in Jesus;" may you rest  
Till " the sea yields her dead," then fully blest,  
May you, with Him, dwell through eternity  
In that good land where shall be no more sea,  
No tears, no partings, on that blissful shore,  
Where gallant ship shall pass by nevermore.

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

A meeting of the Portsmouth General Committee of the Eurydice Relief Fund was held at the College on Monday afternoon. The Commander-in-Chief (Admiral Fanshawe, C.B>) who presided, moved, the ex-Mayor (Mr W. Pink) seconded, and it was resolved : "That this committee, while recognising the expediency of collecting funds for those rendered destitute by the foundering of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice through several agencies as likely to enrol the largest number of subscribers, are of one opinion, that it is desirable, with a view to the efficient administration of the funds collected, that the whole should be distributed through one agency ; and that the machinery of the Patriotic Fund, so enlarged in 1875, for such objects by a Royal Commission, offer the best means for the purpose. That this committee accordingly intends to apply to the Royal Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund to receive the sums collected to be administered by the Royal Commissioners, uuder the schema adopted for the Captain Fund, excepting such sum, as they mihht find absolutely necessary to give for urgent and immediate relief." It was further determined : "That the Secretary be deputed to place himself in communication with the London Eurydice Relief Committee presided over by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, with a view to the joint intentions of the two committees being carried out."

A correspondent to Thursday's *Telegraph*, writes : -—What has been done at the wreck ? is the question heard heard on all sides, and it was past 8 o'clock on Wednesday evening before any information was forthcoming, and then it was of the most unsatisfactory kind. The return of the three tugs and the lighters boded no good, and I regret to have to announce that everything will have to be commenced *de novo*. Without venturing to say who is to blame, there seems to be too much reason to fear that "some one has blundered." The under-swell, it is said, has increased, and the tide runs with so much greater force that the anchors in use would not hold. Others of stouter calibre will have to be taken out, as the joining of the chain cables proved abortive, they were removed. But a flexible steel hawser having been swept under the wreck on Tuesday, it was expected that on Wednesday a second hawser would have been lowered into position, and that on Thursday the raising of the ship would be commenced. This, however, cannot be done, for it was deemed advisable to lift the hawser, and it has been brought into harbour. What will be the next move I cannot pretend to say, for confusion seems to prevail. Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, Controller of the Navy, who has appeared upon the scene, may be able to produce order. Om Wednesday a life pinnace was picked up some 20 miles S.W. of St. Catherine, and is supposed to have formed part of the equipment of the Eurydice. She was brought into harbour, and handed over to the Admiralty authorities. There is now in the private dock at Portsmouth an iron vessel of some 1,200 tons, which, after having broken her back, was got off Bembridge Ledge by Capt. Coffin, who, in the course of the coming summer, will try to lift the Vanguard. It is said that Capt. Coppin offered to lift the Eurydice, but that his services were declined with thanks.

The Secretary to the Admiralty forwards a further list (received by telegraph from the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the North-American Station) of men who were discharged from and to her Majesty's ship Eurydice before she left the West Indies for England viz. : Discharged from Eurydice to Rover - Walter Swindell, able seaman. Discharged to Eurydice from Rover- Charles Nicholson, captain of foretop ;  James T Devine , ordinary seaman; and Robert Hiscutt, engineer's cook.

Battalion Drill - Scene and Thoughts at Nunwell

...

Perhaps we never enjoyed the outlook more than we did on Monday, but to reverse the "silver lining to the cloud," a dark cloud now marred this goden view, when we turned eastward. ws saw some seven Government tugs and barges hovering round the spot (as it were almost beneath us, and within shot reach) when sank the ill-fated Eurydice, which now temporarily coffins a hundred or more gallant sailor boy bodies soon to be exhumed from the water and interred in the land. That is a ghastly picture that even away from the spot we care not to let our imagination turn to – made more ghastly by our belief that had the Steam Salvage Company been entrusted with the work of raising the ship, she would have been in a Portsmouth dock long ago, and her cargo of decomposing corpses consigned to their last resting place. We cannot but think that so much incompetency has been manifested by the dockyard authorities, as was manifested by those on board the ship when she sank. However, we must turn from the ship and view the Volunteers.

To the Editor of the hie of Wight Observer.

Sir.— I think it would have been but bare justice to Mr. Wiltshire, who was deputed to collect money for the Eurydice Fund, had his name appeared, as having been selected for that office, in the paragraph heading the list of subscriptions published in your last issue. It appears to me that this was the least recognition that could be made of his untiring exertions in this charitable work ; a recognition which the public would certainly not have grudged him. Trusting to your courtesy to allow these few lines to appear in your widely circulated journal, and enclosing my card,

I am, Sir, yours faithfully,  
FIAT JUSTITIA, RUAT COELUM.

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

Operations at the wreck of the Eurydice were resumed on Monday amid  considerable difficulties, the Government arrangements having been unsuccessful. The plan whicn had been adhered to for about a month has been abandoned, and three private divers, Messrs. F. Davies, A. Sutherland, and Whittaker. ol the firm of Messrs. Sielee and German, the submarine engineers of London, have been retained. Four tugs, the Grinder, Manly aud Camel appeared on the scene during the day. An attempt was made to descend to the wreck early in the day, but the tide ran so strongly that it was impossible to do so with safety. The divers managed to reach the vessel during the slack tide in the afternoon, and examined her bows and head gear. The new plan is to sweep the ship with two steel hawsers and then to lift and carry her between two lighters to the beach.

The Portsmouth correspondent of the *Telegraph* writing on the 25th inst., says: At the wreck of the Eurydice to-day the divers were enabled to make a descent and even walk almost round the ship. The hawsers were got in position ready for slinging the vessel, and if circumstances continue as favourable as they are now, the attempt to raise her will be made to-morrow [this day, Friday].

Lord Henry Lennox writes to say, regarding the Eurydice fund, that, as far as is at present known, there are between 40 and 50 widows, 170 parents, and from 60 to 70 other relatives who were partly, and in many cases mainly, dependent upon those who have perished, and have therefore claims on the fund. It is calculated that £20,000 will be required in order to administer a minimum relief to all the sufferers. Of this sum about one half has been collected by the committee presided over by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, by the Lord Mayor's committee, and by Admiral Fanshawe's committee at Portsmouth. In order to obtain the amount still necessary, Lord Henry makes a further earnest appeal to the public. The Commissioners of the Royal Patriotic Fund have undertaken the distribution of the money, in accordance with chthea powers conferred upon them by a Royal Commission in 1875.

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

On Wednesday the Admiralty te leg raphed to the officials at Portsmouth Dockyard to the effect that their for ships having observed the increasing disnutiafaction felt by the public, as expressed in the public journals and shared in by themselves, nt the want of success of the operations fur raining the Eurydice, which bad now been sunk since the 24th March, they had instructed the thief-Constructor and the Muster Attendant of Chatham yard (Mr. Baumdors and Capt. Batt) to proceed to Portsmouth, and in consultation with the Chief-Constructor and the Master Attendant of Portsmouth Dockyard, to devise the best means for attaining the object in view as early as possible. Mr. W. B. Robinson, Chief-Constructor at Portsmouth, and Mr. J. C. Froyne, Constructor, proceeded to the wreck on Wednesday to ascertain the character of the operations which have been employed, Ac. A hawser was fastened to the Eurydice's mainmast. and carried to the Malta, which got up full speed. The wreck, however, nnnained itutuovnble. The sweeping of the ie.-el the two 7in. steel hawsers was recommenced, each hawser being capable of sustaining a strain of about 130 tons. On Thursday the two hawsers were fixed in position, round the ship, and on Friday morning the lighters were lashed down to the wreck. The Chatham officials arrived this morning. Directly the tido commenced rising the authorities assembled on the tug arrived at the conclusion that the services of the Pearl and the Rinaldo, supplemented by two mooring lighters, should be brought into requisition, the opinion being entertained that the wreck had to a certain extent become embedded in sand. By Monday it was confidently expected that the wreck would be released from her present meeting. When once she has come away from the bottom, her being floated will almost entirely depend upon the tides, it being expected that each successive tide will enable her to betaken into shore souse 200 yards. When brought above high water mark in Bay she will be pumped out, have her ports closed, and be then ready to float with the rise of the tide. On Saturday the Rinaldo, the Pearl, corvette, and the lighters and tugs were all at hand, the hawsers were made taut, and ono of the two " toggles " which it was determined to plaoo in the pOrts, with hawsers attached, and the ends carried on board lighters, was got into petition. The required rise is 10 feet to 13 feet. it was found that the vested is embedded two feet, and that there is a silting of live feet on the starboard bilge. It was confidently anticipated that the lifting would be accomplished in the course of the next few days. Upwards of a hundred coffins are in readiness to be sent out to receive the bodies found on beard, but whether these will be sufficient cannot of course be known until the divers have penetrated below, which they have not yet been able to do. On Sunday morning she was moved and pat on even keel, and Mrs all thought the end near at haul, but unhappily one of the 7in. steel hawsers gave way; also one of the auxiliaries, so that the work of lifting had to be postponed. It was thought that the two steel hawsers were fully equal to the strain, but on the turn of the tide, the Pearl. on swinging. caused such a tremendous strain on the hawser that it parted. The Rinaldo afterwards let go the hawser attached to her. The weight proved much heavier than expected—up to 300 tons. The Loudon divers have left the scene of the wreck, as some days must elapse before stouter hawsers can be placed in position and the work resented. The divers have found that the ship is much heavier than was supposed being weighted with sand, and bedd nea rly nine feet, the starboard bilge sills being about level with the ground. The officials have determined to supplement the Pearl and Rinaldo with toggles to be placed in the ports of the Eurydice, attached to lighters, four on either side, and to use eight-inch jewel chains. The operations will be resumed when the tide

THE EURYDICE.

Though the result of the operations around the Eurydice on Sunday has produced great disappointment at Portsmouth, now that the officers are in possession of the exact state of the case with which they have to deal, they are, if anything, oven more hopeful than before of being able to raise the unfortunate ship. They are, however, fully cognizant of the increased difficulty of the task before them, and measures are being promptly taken to meet it, though, as the present tides will not serve, seeing that a rise of 13ft. will be required to pull the ship out of its bed, a fortnight will probably elapse before the operation of lifting can be renewed. In the meantime, it is necessary that an ample margin should be allowed for that at present unknown quantity, the dead weight of the ship *plus* the strain which will be needed to overcome the suction between the ship and the burrow which she has formed for herself in the sand. Preparations are being made to resist a strain of some 700 tons. This is more than double the estimated dead-weight of the ship in her normal state, before the saturation of her planks and timbers and the introduction of sand into her hold through the main deck lee ports,which, as already stated, are on a level with the ground. It will also be necessary to provide against unequal distribution of strains, for it is evident that where a heavy weight has to be grappled with from purchases suspended from a moving surface or platform, great care is required so to adjust them as to prevent one hawser feeling the pinch in advance of the rest, and thus being subjected to abnormal tension. After a consultation between the Portsmouth and Chatham dockyard officers, it has been decided to supplement the buoyant power of the Pearl and the Rinaldo by dropping "toggles" through the whole of the ports of the Eurydice and attaching them to lighters placed four on each side, whereby, it is thought, the ship will be lifted evenly and bodily out of her bed. It has also been deoraed expedient to put more ballast into the Pearl and the Rinaldo in order that they may be brought down nearer to their load line, and thus acquire a firmer grasp of the water. The Rinaldo has already been brought from the scene of the wreck into harbour to receive the additional ballast on board. Eight-inch jewel chains will also probably be used, as, while steel hawsers will resist enormous vertical or horizontal strains, the unfortunate experience of Sunday proved that they are exceedingly liable to part where a nip occurs. But the most important additional factor which will be imported into the operations is the famous Popoff air-bag, which was experimentally tested at Portsmouth in 1875 with reference to its applicability to raise the Vanguard, and which was subsequently put to practical use to assist in raising the Oberon, torpedo ship, from the shoal at the mouth of the harbour. The bag, which is a combination of cordage, canvas, and vulcanized rubber, measures 22ft. in length and 12ft. in breadth and when inflated to its full extent resembles a cylindrical boiler. The total displacement of the bag is about 6O tons, and when introduced through the hatches of the Eurydice, it will be able to lift to that amount minus its own weight of 47cwt. 2qrs 14lbs. Owing to the gale which prevailed, nothing was done on Monday at the wreck. Indeed, it was found necessary to bring the lighters in, one or two- of them running great risk of being lost. Two additional divers have been brought from Devonport to assist in the preliminary operations.

Ventnor. Concert at Ventnor in aid of the Eurydice Distres Fund.

A very excellent entertainment was given last Friday afternoon in the fine coffee room of the Royal Hotel, kindly lent by Mr. Mason, in aid of the Eurydice Distress Fund. We regret to have to say that the attendance was somewhat limited. The names of those who with the greatest good nature came from Ryde and who did so much to make the concert a success, should have provoked a hearty reception from the dwellers in Ventnor. The programme appended will indicate the character of the entertainment ; and as to the several performers, we do not know that we can say more than that each achieved a perfect success. Miss Wallace, daughter of Col. Wallace, of Ryde, who won the unqualified praise of musical critics by her singing at a concert in the Albert Hall, sang as well as we remember to have heard her, and dispite the rule to the contrary, was obliged to submit to an encore. Miss Jessie Browne was suffering from a slight cold, yet fully sustained her reputation, and won rounds of applause. Miss Abbott, who is the daughter of a gentleman visiting Ventnor, is a performer of great finish, and was vehemently encored. Master Denton sang very sweetly and added very greatly to the pleasure of the afternoon, winning loud applause and a decided encore when he sang "The little tin soldier." Mr. Perkins, also a visitor, is a thorough musician, and a violinist of the highest order. Thanks cannot be too heartily given given to Miss M. Fowles, who most efficiently discharged the part of accompanist throughout. We should not omit to mention that Mr. Bourne, Manager of the Isle of Wight Railway, readily sent passes for those ladies and gentleman of Ryde who so kindly gave their help. The programme was as foliows : Pianoforte Solo, Ballade (Opus 23rd), Miss H. D. Abbot. Song, "Che faro senza Eurydice," Miss Wallace. Song, "The Token," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Vioiiu Soio i\ D. Perkin, Esq. song " Non é Ver," Miss Jessie Browne. Song, "O fond dove, O fair dove," Master Willie Denton. Pianoforte Solo, " Introduzione and Rondo " from Sonata (Opus 53) Miss H. D. Abbott. Song, "Martin the man-at-arms," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Violin Solo, T. D. Perkins, Esq. Song "Waiting," Miss Jessie Browne. Pianoforte Solo, " Soiree de Vienne valse Caprice," Miss H. D. Abbott. Song, "It was a dream," Miss Wallace. Song, Dudley Watkins, Esq. Song, "The Little Tin Soldier," Master W. Denton.

THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

It is now more than six weeks since the Eurydice sank, and, so far from the wreck being nearer the surface, it has become embedded still deeper in sand and clay. Three hundred tons was the strain estimated at the last attempt to raise the vessel, but experience has been gained by the failure, aud the authorities are providing a lifting power of 1,000 tons for the next attempt. Toggles are to be inserted in each porthole, and hawsers attached to them as weil as passed uuder the ship. The lifting power thus obtained will be tremendous, and, unless some parts of the vessel are carried away by the enormous strain, the wreck is almost certain to be lifted. Large steel hawsers are to be used, and in consequence of the increased amount of lift, additional lighters are being prepared. It is proposed to take out the fore and mizen masts before lifting the ship. Although the extent of the requirements of the relief cannot even now be fully known, it has been proved that 43 widows and 50 children have been rendered destitute, and appeals for help have come from 57 mothers, six sisters, and five other relatives.

On Wednesday a body was found floating close to the wreck. It was placed in a boat, aud lowed by a tug into Portsmouth Harbour. From the description of the clothing it was evident that the body was that of one of the crew of the Eurydice. It was in an advanced state of decomposition, and therefore perfectly unrecognisable, except by tattoo marks on the breast, or by the clothes. A diver encountered a body in the fore channel, but in attempting to raise it the hand came off, and this is missing from the body. This is the first body recovered out of the more than 30O persons who went down with the ill-fated craft more than five weeks since. The corpse was taken to Haslar Hospital.

A correspondent writing to a contemporary says : How are we to pronounce the name of the ill-fated vessel which went down in the snow-storm of the 24th ult. ? Classical readers will have no difficulty in deciding on what ought to be the pronunciation, but nine persons out of ten persist in dividing the word into only three syllables, laying the accent on the ultimate, thus— Eu-ry-d*i*ce. The "correct thing," however, is to call the wrecked vessel Eu-ryd-i-ce making it sound as four syllables and accenting the ante-penultimate, or second syllable. In heathen mythology Eurydice was the wife of the poet Orpheus. As she fled before Aristaeus, who wished to do her violence, she was bitten by a serpent in the grass and died of the wound. Orpheus was so disconsolate that he ventured to go to Hades, where, by the melody of his lyre, he obtained from Pluto the restoration of his wife to life provided he did not look behind him before he came upon earth. He violated the condition; his eagerness to see his wife rendered him forgetful, he looked behind and Eurydice was for ever taken from him. Will the attempt to recover the unfortunate vessel be any more successful?

CORRESPONDENCE. THE WRECK THE EURYDICE.

To the Editor of the Evening News.

Sir, —Some three weeks or more ago, it was freely published in various papers throughout the country, that the public were becoming greatly dissatisfied with the fact that the Eurydice, with probably over 150 bodies on board, had not been raised. On Sunday, March 24th, the Eurydice foundered with her living freight off Dunnose, and freely state is a national disgrace that, close proximity to our greatest naval port, the ship should be in far worse state now than when she foundered. Prior to my entering the dockyard service, had some knowledge wrecks, which is thoroughly implanted on my memory. In the present case, there has been employed a Master Attendant, an Assistant Master Attendant, the Chief and Assistant Constructors of Portsmouth Dockyard, and the Master Attendant and Chief Constructor of Chatham Dockyard but with all their superior knowledge (because superior knowledge it must be) the Eurydice still lays where she fonndered. What practical man in wrecking, would have thought of employing such vessels as the Pearl, Rinaldo, two dockyard lighters, and now, the Swan and Wave, both old gunboats. I certainly should not have done so. I should have designed certain camels and placed them in such positions that I am certain, barring all casualties, the Eurydice would long ere this have been safe in Portsmouth Harbour. Nearly a fortnight ago I was talking to Capt. Coppin on other matters, when asked my opinion of the Eurydice, which I gave him. The plan of this country is, unfortunately, to take the advice of the man receiving the largest salary.  
I am, Sir, yours obediently,  
Southsea, May 11. A Practical Shipwright.

THE EURYDICE. Five bodies (or rather portions) have been recovered during the week. One was a seaman named Taylor, and another Lieut. George Falconer, R.M.

The proper pronunciation of the name of the ill-fated ship is Eu-*ryd*-i-ce, making it sound as four syllables, accenting the second.

Operations at the wreck were resumed yesterday (Tuesday). Five toggles have been got in. Both the Pearl and the Rinaldo have been fitted with Merryweather's fire engines, so that, if considered desirable, resort may be had to water ballast. As the lift at the utmost at high water will not exceed 11ft., eight lifts will probably be required to float the sunken vessel into the shallow water in Sandown Bay. The beaching of the vessel has been found to be absolutely necessary, as there is insufficient water in the harbour and fairway at high water to enable the Eurydice to be towed in and docked in much below her normal load-line. It has been proposed to dispense with the lighters altogether. In their stead, and to secure additional buoyancy, two old gunboats, the Wave and the Swan, are to be employed.

*Iron.* – Our prophecy that the "scientific officers" in her Majesty's service would find the Eurydice too much fur them, has, we regret to say, been realised in the most complete manner. There is no doubt that the " fighting officers" in the Royal Navy are, so far as pluck, English grammar, and good manners are concerned, as exeellent gentlemen as any in the service of Britannia. Vicariously they rule the waves for her, but when submarine operations are to the fore they are wofully at fault. The Eurydice affair is a catalogue of melancholy failure. Setting aside the vexed question of seamanship as to her loss, her subaqueous record is full of blundering. The Admiralty very naturally opined that there ought to be somebody about Portsmouth Dockyard who could raise a sunken ship, and orders were forthwith sent to Portsmouth to lift the Eurydice. As it turned out, this decision was unfortunate. Perhaps it might have been as well to employ practical people. Fighting officers always fight well, but they know nothing about raising ships.

*British Medical Journal.* – Both the Royal George and the Eurydice sank in tideways, with very strong currents, which, from the first instant, swept constantly through the hatchways and open ports with searching effect ; so it may be surmised that many unattached floating masses lying in their course would be carried away and rolled into deeper waters or on to the shore. It is a remarkable feature in the Eurydice that so few of the watch on deck floated away from her, and that so very few corpses have been anywhere found. This may perhaps be explained on the suddenness of the struggle for life in the water, and the vortex created by the sinking ship taking them with her to the bottom ; and the same reasons will apply *á fortiori* to the watch off duty and between decks. We think that, by calmly reflecting on such ideas, the minds of those who are now in eager expectation may he brought to a tone conducive to submission to many disappointments on clearance of the vessel.

*Review.* — It was asserted that the frigate had drifted of her own accord from the position in which she lay. The dockyard authorities published a notice, in which they pointed out the incorrectness of this assertion, and naively protested that the ship had not altered her position since she foundered. That protest is also the general complaint of the public. She ought to have altered positin so much as to be now safe in port. We can safely assert that if the Eurydice had been a trading vessel insured in England, she would have been afloat about three weeks ago. Possibly no cable would have been passed round her longitudinally ; probably none would have been passed under her keel. She is so buoyant that hawsers would merely have been passed through her open ports and firmly fixed, and this done she would have been lifted to the surface on the first fine day. We think underwriters may congratulate themmselves on possessing a staff of practical experts who have qualified themselves better than the engineers in Portsmouth dockyard to accomplish the task of raising a sunken vessel.

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

Late on Friday night a storm set in, and the Rinaldo and the Rinaldo and the lumps, which were moored near the wreck of the Eurydice, had to slip their cables and make for port, in tow of the Griuder. The iron toggles wnich the divers succeeded in dropping into the ports will have to be removed, and their places supplied by wooden toggles of greater bearing area, as the former have been found to bend and come cut under the strain of thirteen tons. The Rinaldo was taken back to her moorings on the following day, and the mauly was out at the wreck on Sunday, when two additional toggles were put into position. Shortly after mid-day two coastguardsmen who were on duty at St. Lawrence observed a body floating about three miles out to sea. They at once launched a boat, and succeeded in bringing the body in tow to Ventnor, where it was found to be that of a marine, evidently from the wreck of the Eurydice. Tne features were beyond identification, but it was found that the body is George Falconer. The body was landed that of on the Isle of Wight, and the Coroner, considering an inquest unnecessary, gave an order for the burial which took place on Tuesday afternoon. The body was interred in Ventnor Cemetery with military honours and a large number of the townspeople attended. The Government tugs and divers resumed operations on Monday, but the boisterous weather prevented much progress being made. On Tuesday morning, however, they again proceeded out of harbour to the wreck. As many as a dozen or 16 toggles will be used if they can be successfully introduced into the ports , the hawsers still remain rouud the Eurydice, with buoys to pick them up. The Pearl was finished for service on Monday, and can be brought into requisition on whatever day it is thought advisable. A telegraphic statement of the exact rise and fall of the tide is daily sent from the wreck to the dockyard authorities, so that they may know when the tide is likely to serve, and they are putting their plans into execution with as much dispatch as is practicable, considering the difficulties which have to be encountered, aud the unfavourable turn of the weather. These difficulties are increasing every day, the wreck having within the last week or ten days sunk further in the mud by several feet.

On Tuesday morning, about 11 o'clock, John Gawn, a fisherman of Portsmouth, while near the Warner light, picked up the body of a seaman belonging to the Eurydice. Just before that time George Comer, a fisherman, of Gosport, had picked up another body near the same spot. Both bodies were towed into harbour and were taken to the Gosport Coastguard station, to which place a handcart and coffins were conveyed from Haslar Hospital, and the bodies were placed in them and taken to the dead-house at that place. One of the bodies was that of a young man whose name is supposed to be William Hendy. Both bodies are in a very advanced stage of decomposition.

The Duke aud Duchess of Edinburgh have forwarded to the Lord Mayor a donation of £ 100 towards the support of the widows, orphans, and dependant relatives of the men who lost their lives in the Eurydice.

Mr. E. J. Physick, sculptor, has been commissioned to execute the monument in memory of Lieut. Frank Tabor, R.N., who was picked up in an exhausted condition, and expired shortly after the sinking of H M.S. Eurydice. The memorial will be erected over the grave in Cheam churchyard, Surrey, and the design prepared by Mr Physick is singularly appropriate as a memento of the sad circumstances which caused its erection.

THE EURYDICE.

The inclement weather of the last few days has kept the operations of the wreck in complete obeyance. It is now hoped that the tides will sufficiently answer *within a fortnight* to enable the attempt to be made to lift the Eurydice ! A waterman has succeeded in up Captain Hare's writing desk, and handed it over to the Coastguard at Bembridge, by whom it was forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief. The gales have disturbed the banks of sand and freed many bodies – several of which have been recovered.

On Saturday two more bodies which were decomposed beyond recognition, picked up near the wreck, were, brought into Portsmouth harbour by the steam tug Grinder and conveyed to Haslar Hospital One is evidently a seaman, thother is believed to be a marine. The Rinaldo reports that the body of an officer passed her as she lay anchored near the wreck on Friday night, but the sea was too rough for a boat to be lowered. The body subsequently washed ashore off Sea View, and has been identified as that of Lieutenant Barry. The south cone was hoisted at the semaphore on Saturday evening, and the gale which sprang up during the night prevented the tugs from proceeding out of harbour during Sunday. The squally weather and the heavy gale from the W.S.W. will, it is expected, tend to ease the position of the the wreck, and lead to large numbers of bodies floating through the ports.

FOUNDERING OF H.M.S. EURYDICE. - The prevalence of high swinds and strong tides have pre- e vented anything like successful operations being carried out by the authorities engaged in the attempt to raise | the Erytdice. The efforts of the party arc by no means er le relaxed, and advantage is taken of every opportunity ah which presents itnelfi Four bodies, however, have been m recovered since Saturday. The first was that of a marine it named George Falconer, which was observed by the Coast- guardsmen at St. Lawrence, early on Sunady afternoon. The body was brought ashore by a boat which the Coast- guard put off in, and on the Isle of Wight Coroner bein communimcated' vith,. he did'not consider au inquest n necessary.

Do nillc, c.n., tl.D, had ,odins e sent down to fth jetty, and the bodies were conveyed in them to the dead-house at the Hospital. In order that i- there should be no delay in the identification of the it corpses, Mr. Superintendent Cheyney communicated by n telegraph with the County Coroner (Edgar Goblc, Esq.), h who decided to hold the inquest on the bodies at once. to ?? Jury were, in consequence, hastily summoned, if andmct at Haslar Hospital last evening. The two bodies If were identified by Charles Carter, foreman of labourers se at the Hospital, who stripped.them, and found the nmmees of the men upon the clothing. The bodies were those of Is Edward Lockett and William E. Sandy, ordinary scalien, x second class. An excellent arrangement has been made t- for the identification of the bodies. The Inspector- ie General has had a complete list made of the whole of the a- crew and passengers of the Eurdice-321 in number. h The names marked on the clothing of the bodies recovered are compared with this list, and providing there is no r other way of recognizing the corpses,..identilication can n be established by this means. Both bodice were d much decomposed, the flesh being entirely removed s from the faces, and the hands were also missing. Sandy had on a. serge, a flannel, a check shirt, Ls trowacrs, &e.; and Lockett had. on two flannels and d a check shirt and trowsers. The lower jaw of Sandy was a entirely gone. In his troweaers pocket were found one d penny piece, three halfpence, and two buttons. Formal r- evidence of identification was taken, 'and the inquest was vadjournedtothe date originally fixedthe 23rd inst. The men Sino recovered the bodies were bound over to appear then, and also,thetwo ?? irtin Cuddeford and Sidney Id Fletcher, the latter being sick, a patientin Haslar Hospital A- The funeral of the two men will take place this (Wednes- day) afterneon. The third body, which was landed on the ie Portsmouth side of the harbour, was conveyed in a shell to the dead-house adjoining Porteca police-station As it ts had been landed within the jurisdiction of the Borough d Coroner, it was thought that an inquest would be held by d that gentleman, but it appears that this duplication of d depositions is not likely to occur, as the Coroner expressed aa desire that if the Chief-Constable were satisfied that the t body had come from the Eetrvdice, it might be conveyed to a Hasiarashe considered it inexpedient that inquiries should 0 be opened in various parts of the county on the ?? mat- t tr. The body, although not identified up to last night, t has no doubt come from the ill-fated ship. It has on a pair dof laced boots, brown Botks, blue cloth troweers wliteshirt, eland drawers, and short blue serge jacket. This latter Aarticle leads to the supposition that the body is either than 'f of an officer's servant or steward. At all events he evidently belonged to the non-combatant elass. Thebones i5 of the head were perfcetly bare, and both bands had been .t eaten off. The flesh had also come off a considerable por- y tion of the right arm, the bones of which were bared for d several inches. The corpse will be removed to Haslar, h where it will be stripped, and identification will no doubt :d be established by the marking of the clothing. Nothing is was found in the pockets of t'he deceased. A ,FUNERAL OF THE MARINE. 5Our Veatnor correspondent telegraphs last night that k the funeral of George Falconer, the marine whose body 3 was picked up off Ventnor on Sunday, took place yesterday ib afternoon.

THE EURYDICE.

The funeral of the late Lieutenant S. A. B. Burney was held at Haslar Cemetery on Tuesday afternoon in a spot which has been selected for the officers whose bodies may be recovered from the wreck of the Eurydice. The corpses of the crew are being buried in a plot of ground adjoining the square in which the sufferers from the Thunderer explosion are laid, and the spots which have been chosen for the graves of the officers lie on each side of the middle line, and contiguous to the site on which it is proposed to raise a memorial of the disaster. Lieut. Burney was buried with naval honours, the funeral cortege being composed of a couple of officers in full dress and of the aame rank as the deceased, and twenty bluejackets from each man-of-war in the harbour, headed by a firing party of 100 rank and file from the Boyal Marines, under the command of Captain Bsmber, and the band of Her Majesty'a ahip St. Vincent, which played Dead Marchea to the Cemetery. The father of the deceased, Captain Burney (Superintendent of the Greenwich Hospital Schools), and hia three sons were the chief mourners, and were followed by the Rev. E. Burney, Captain Balliston, of the Alberta, and a number of personal frienda in and out of uniform. The coffin having been covered with a Union Jack and placed on a gun carriage, was drawn to the Cemetery by seamen of the fleet, the pall being supported by Commander Hulton, Staff-Commander Macfarlane, and four senior lieutenants. The funeral service was read by the Rev. F. W. Nickoll, the chaplain of the hospital, and the usual three volleys were fired over the grave. Lieutenant Burney, who waa only 23 at the time of his death, joined the Eurydice on her being commissioned for the special service on which she waa employed, having just previoualy gained his lieutenant's commission as a reward for passing a highly satisfactory examination at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. He was considered one of the most promising young officers in the service, and his loss is deeply deplored by his friends and relatives. His body was picked up on Saturday morning by a pilot boat about a couple of miles out to sea to the eastward of the wreck, and was landed at Sea View, Isle of Wight, and thence conveyed to Haslar Hospital. The body was identified by means of a gold watch, which bore an inscription showing that it had been presented to the deceased by his father on obtaining his lieutenant's commission. The tugs and divers went out to the wreck of the Eurydice on Wednesday morning, but in consequence of a heavy swell prevailing at the back of the Wight they returned again into harbour. Hicks, the shipwright diver, made a descent, and found that the result of the late gales had been to bring the upper sill of the lee ports on a level with the mud bottom. The channels are now within 1ft. of the sea floor, and as the ship retains the same angle of heel, it is evident that she has sunk 2 1/2ft. further into the ground, that the lee ports are now wholly under the sand, and that she is fast making a hole for herself. During the high tide of Tuesday a diver's boat was stove in, and one ofthe mooring lighters received a great deal of injury and was nearly swamped. On Wednesday morning the body of Albert C. Doogood. an ordinary seaman of the first class, was landed at Sea View, Isle of Wight, by a pilot boat, and afterwards taken to Haslar.

*To the Editor of the Hampshire Advertiser.*

Sir,— Will you kindly oblige by correcting an error in your paper of to-day respecting the picking up of the body of Lieut. S. A. B. Burney of H.M S Eurydice, by the Coastguard at Sea View. The facts are that the body was picked up at sea by the Emma, pilot cutter, of this place, brought here, and given in charge of the chief boatman, who telegraphed to the Admiralty at Portsmouth. A Government seam tug was at once sent, wbich took the body to Portsmouth. I am, sir, your obedient servant,  
Henry Knapp, pilot,  
Emma, pilot cutter.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

Writing from Portsmouth on Saturday, a says:—

Within the last ten days no fewer than sixteen bodies from the Eurydice have been picked up. Eight had been recovered up to Thursday. On Friday six were found in the neighbourhood of Chichester, and on Saturday two were brought in to Portsmouth Harbour. One of three was the body of George Curd, an ordinary martian, which was identified by the name on the jacket; and the other was the body of John Mitchell, a chief petty officer and seaman gunner which was identified by his widow by some tattoo marks on his arm.

THE "EURYDICE" FATALITY.

*Republishes the Hampshire Advertiser article of Saturday 25 May 1878, but ends short and slightly differently:*

During the recent gales the Eurydice has sunk two feet and a half further into the mud, and the misgivings as to the possibility of her being raised are now materially strengthened.

THE EURYDICE

Exactly two mouths had elapsed last Sunday since the capsising of the Eurydice, which lies buried still deeper in the sandy bottom, defying the ingenuity of the officials and the vast store of appliances which have been brought into requsition for the purpose of raising the wreck. Anxiety as to the lifting of the ill-fated ship continues, and doubts are expressed as to whether it will ever to come to the surface unless blown up— an idea most repugnant to those having friends on board. Work was attempted again on Sunday, but the tugs had to return in consequence of the high wind blowing. The divers succeeded on Saturday in inserting a toggle into the lee side of the ship. Several more bodies have been picked up on the Sussex coast.

A portion of the wreckage of this vessel has been washed ashore at Rottingdean, and on Friday the bodies of two of the seamen were discovered in the sea near Saltdean. They had evidently been in the water for a considerable time, the feet and hands being eaten away, and they presented altogether a terribly decomposed and shocking appearance. The clothing on the bodies were respectivel) marked "G. Gordon" and "A. Barnes. On Friday evening the body of another seaman was picked up at Lancing. The body was in a very decomposed state, especially about the extremities. The name "J. Appledore" was marked on the guernsey under the collar.

Another body was picked up at Selsey on Monday, but identification was impossible in consequence of the state in which it was discovered.

*The Army and Navy Gazette* remarks :— The statement made by a weekly contemporary that " the efforts made by the Admiralty to raise the Eurydice are nothing more than what is in theatrical parlance termed 'gag'— that in fact, they have never seriously intended to raise her"— is nothing less than fiction. The Admiralty fully intended to raise the ship, and the fault of the whole work has been that those entrusted with the preparations under-estimated the difficulties, and apparently did not take pains to ascertain what kind of bottom she was resting on. That she may never be raised is not now at all beyond belief, but it will be owing to error and not design if she never floats again.

We are inclined to the opinion of many who ought to know something of the matter, that the Eurydice will never be raised. She would, doubtless, have been blown up long ago, but for the effect this would have had on the feelings of the relatives of the unfortunate men, for the *attempt* to raise has cost perhaps as much as two or three Eurydices would ; and even if she were got up she would not be worth anything. We believe she will remain till all the bodies have disappeared, and then a charge of dynamite will cause their temporary coffin to disappear also.

THE CHIEF CONSTRUCTOR ON THE EURYDICE, &c.—

The chief constructor of the Dockyard (Mr. W. B. Robinson), addressing the members of the Literary and Scientific Society, lat week, said that non-attention to science was sure to lead to failure, and sometimes to catastrophe. The capsising of H.H.S. Captain would have been prevented had the officer in command read an article previously written by the present member for Pembroke. That article would have taught him the folly of carrying sail on the ship under the circumstances it was carried when she went down. There was a more recent catastrophe which he would not discuss, but he very much regretted— and it was common enough to regret— that science had not been called in for more than four weeks to devise the best means of raising the Eurydice. It was essential that a man should know enough of ordinary things in a scientific manner, in order to foresee what was likely to happen. The President (Mr. J. Douglas) remarked that it was a disgrace to engineering men that that vessel should remain unraised, and the scandal was the greater that Captain Coppin, of the Steam Salvage Company, offered to raise the Eurydice immediately afer the disaster, but received no reply for nearly a fortnight, when his offer was declined with thanks. As he understood, Captain Coppin had afterwards offered to bring up the bodies from the ship, but this offer was also declined.

ESCAPE OF A RYDE MAN FROM THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

A young man named Hayes, whose mother was a member of the Sivell family of this town, had a very fortunate escape from being lost in the ill0fated ship. About a week before the vessel sailed from the West Indies, hayes was taken ill, and had to be taken on shore to the hospital. His friends at first thought he was drowned, but a letter has, since the disaster, been received, which announced the gratifying fact that Hayes is alive and restored to health.

OPENING OF THE NEW PIER.

Sandown was en fete on Wednesday, the day fixed for the op ning of the new pi^r, and every one seemed impressed with the fact that th>; event was j one of no ordinary importance in the history of th- 1 litrle town. Lady Oglander very kindly consented to petform the opening ceremony, but so unpropiti- ous was the weather at the beginning of the day j that for some time it was doubtful whether a post- j ponemenfc Avould not be necessary. The rain fell all the morning without ceasing, a*nd of course made the roads in the neighbourhood of the pier dirty and muddy ; but, as the hour fixed for the cerenv ny ap- proached, the t-ky commenced clearing, and by o o'clock it was tolerably fine. A considerable num- ber of persona then began to flock to the pier, the j approaches to which were decorated with banners and flags. Across the street which Lady Oglander would have to pass was stretched a banner, bearing the arms of the Oglander family and the motto "Server Mania Vitre," on each side of which was the word " Welcome." Above the street leading to the pier was a banner bearing the words "Success to the Pier," and over the pier gates another, bid- ding all " Welcome." There was also plenty of bunting about, a number of poles being placed at regular intervals en both sides of the pier, and each carrying a gay flag. With respect to the pier itself, which next claims our notice, it must not be under- stood that it is actually finished. Only a portion of the structure — half the total length contemplated — is finishe. , but of course this is suflirient to give a good ider. of its general effect, and makes a very nice promenade. Unlike the piers we have seen else- where, the seats run down the whole length. From the pierhead can be obtained capital views, not only seaward but of the c iffs, sands, and general b'cenery of the interior of the Island. The pi? r looks a very lig't structure — nn. omfortably so, in fact. The iron piles on which it rests are so slight, and their distance one from the oth^r is so great, as to lead one to doubt whether it will be found sufficiently strong to withstand the winter waves Avhieh roll into the bay. This uncomfortable feeling was in- tensified by the appearance of a. wreck close at hand — the John Douse— highly suggestive of the stormy waters which the structure will have to withstand ; while fun her out to sea, and almost in line with the hi ad of the pier, was another di.-m.al sight — the ma>ts of the wreck of the Eurydice, still beneath the waters, and still holding many a score of the bodies of brave young tars These were two things highly suggestive of what the winds and waves can do about here. We suppose, however, that the light- ness of the pier just at the parts which are finished does not matter, and doubtless the structure will be ma le more substantial a-» it reaches that portion of the shore where the full fury of the waves will be c countered. However, a pier seems to be a neces- sity for bandown, and we congratulate the inhabi- tants of the little town upon their energy and evi- dent determination to improve the place. THE OPENING CEREMONY. Shortly after 1 o'clock the townspeople began to flock to the pier. A number of the n^ ember d of the Nuuwrll Volunteers were drawn up on each side of the pier gates, as a sort of gu ird of honour, under the command ot their popular young captain (A. Brook Leeds, Esq.) and Lieut P uud, while the band was stationed at the end of the pier to add harmony to the proceedings. Amongst those assem- bled at the pier gates to welcome Lady Oglander on her arrival were F. Pittis, E.-q (Mayor of Newport), Col. (Jurrie (chairmau of the VV-ntnor Local Board), Mr. Walter Mew (chairman of the Sandowu Local Board), W. 11. Wooldridge, Esq (clerk to the Local Board), Mr. Eldridge (town clerk of Newport), the Rev. YV. M. Harrison, Dumpier Child, Esq , and the following members of the Sandown Local Board : Dr. Bulbeck, Messrs. Linn Id, Love, J. K. Hollis, Warne, Pelley, and Box. L idy Oglander arrived punctually at the time fixed, accompanied by Major Leeds, and on alighting from her carriage was re- ceived by Mr. Wooldridge, who introduced the Chairman and members of the Sandown Local Board to her ladyship. Mr. Walter Mew (chairman) then -topped torward and presented h°r ladyship with an address from the Board In doing so he expressed trie great pleasure he felt in seeing her ladyship present, and thauked her for the interest she had al- ways taken in Sandown, at the same time express- ing the hope that she would long be spared to them. Mr. Wooldridge then reai the address, which was handsomely engrossed on vellum, an I signed by 155 ratepayers and inhabitants of the district. It was as follows : To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Park, Isle of Wight. Madam, — ?? tuo Local B ard of the disrrict of San- duwu, ?? Wi^ht, and the undersigned ratepayers md mhnbitants of the district, beg respectfully to express the great pleasure and giatification whi h it gives us to •<ee your ladyship taking p.ut in, and inaugurating; the .pening of a Pier in taudown. We are wed as-ured that your ladyship at all times takes aa interest in all ■natters connected with the pubac welfare of Sandown and its inhabitants ; knowing, as we do, the readiness and liberality with which yo-i have always cunrnbur d ro, and assisted ail chariiable, and other local undertak- ings, we trust that your ladyship may long be spared aud be a^le to assist, aud participate in all public erne - prises which may c >nduce to the prosperity of the town ■>f Sandowu, in which, as Lidy of the Manor, we f«el sure you wi.l alwa}s have a deep and sincere in'treat. With ever expression of respect aud estee v, We are, your ladyship's faithful servants, Walter Mew, Chairman. The Common Seal of the Local B ard of Sand wn. was affixed, this 27th day uf May, 1873, in pursuance of a resolution unanimously passed at a special meeting, held oi the 24 'h day of May, 1878, in the presence of Mr. H. Wooldridge, clerk to the B ard. Leaning on the arm of .Major Leeds, her ladyship then walked to the end of tho pier, which had been carpeted for the occasion. Here she was introduced to the chairman and directors of the Pier Company Her ladyship having bri fly declared the pier open, Mr. Jonathan Jollitfe, the chairman of the company, stepped forward and presented her ladyship with. ano her address. He expl lined that the company had a hard struggle to get the pier completed so far, but they hoped to be able to make the structure double its present length, and to place a lifeboat at the end. It would then be very useful for yachts aud steamers, which would be able to land passen- gers here. He then presented the address, which was also engrossed on vellum, and read as follows : To Lady Oglauder, N unwell Ptrk. Isle . f VVi^ht. Madam, — The chairman and directors of the Sandown Pier Uoinp-iuy, heg to welcome your ladysuip .n this, to them, important occasion, and at the same time ex- press iheir sincere thanks f>r your kindness in consent- ing to preside a' the opening of the pier. It is only alter having overcome many difficulties, and even local 'Pposilion, that the directors have at length succeeded iv coiupleiing the iirst s«oti- >n of the pier, so as to permit the same to be opened for the use of 'he public. However, they hope to receive such pecuniary assistance from residents, owners nf property, and oihi-ra inceresied in the welfare of Saudowu., as may enable them 'o Complete the original design, and carry out the pier to ir» full lengih of 650 teet, being nearly double the length of the p.nion already constructed, and so kindly opened by >our ladyship. — The directors are sure thatthe pier will atford a pleasaut and agreeable promenade, and prove a source of attraction to the towa of Sand >wu and its vii.ors; and they venture also to hope that it may ultimately prov • useful, not only for purp -ses of recrea- tion, but also a station from which a lifeboat may bo launched. R cent sad events tiut have taken place in tuc bay deepen the conviction that Sandown will prove a most iin port-in t stati in foi a lifeb >at. ?? the carrying I out so laudable an object the directors can only trust to the libeniliiy and sympathy of the public geuernlly — j Again thanking y>>ur ladyship tor the k'ud interest you j have shown in the w rk the directors have in hand by J your presence here to-day, and with every good wish for ! your welfare and happiness, We beg to remain, Your ladyship's obedient aud fitiihful oervants Jonathan Jo luff e, KicHA.tD Dampiek Child, George Pelley, James Kennington. The seal of the Sandown Pier Company (Limited) was affixed this 28th day of May, 1878, in pursuance of a resolution duly parsed at a meeting of the directors ia the presence of W. H. Wouldridge, secretary. This portion of the ceremony concluded, Miss Brandt ; stepped forward, and, on behalf of the d-rtctors presented her ladyship with a very handsome bou- quet. Her ladyship briefly replied as follows; "Mr , Chairman and gentleman oi the Sandown Locai Board and gentlemen of the Sandown Pier Company -I thank you v ry much for the kind and gratify- ! ing reeepti-m you have given me. It atf-rds me at I ail times siucere pleasure to assist iv any way in , promoting the prosperity oi" Sandown, and I trus. the undertakii.g you have so biiccts.-fully curried out aud inaugurated this day may prove one of the many means of adding to the attractions of the place, and tin additional source of heakh and enjoyment to ; visitors and iiihitbi>:m r s alike. ' Hearty h»-ers wer i th n given for hey Jady>hip, and a number ot the yeutl9m«a present having been introduced tv her j *© procession again went up the pier; her ladyship I a L A1 « l ]>r Leeds re-entered their carringe, and drove | oft amidst the loud cheers of the assembled specta- | tow. This concluded the ceremony, which was fol- I lowed by A B.VNQUBT, which took pla".o at half-past 5, in the Town Hall, where about 70 gnntl-men sat down to the excellent repast provided. The chair was taken by Mr. Jon. ! Jolliffe, and the viee-chair by Mr. Walter Maw; : there being also present Capt. Brook Leeda, Lieut'. i Pound, Col. Currie, Rev. W. M. Harrison, Mr. W. i H. Wooldridge, Col. Brandt, Mr. F. Pitt is, Mr. F. Pittas, jun., Mr. T. H. Urry, Mr. W. H. Barton, Mr. C. Cr. Vincent, Dr. Meerea, Mr. Binn» (engineer), I Mr. D. Mitchell, Mr. Linfield, Mr. J. K. Hotiis, Mr. ! L. H. Saunders, Mr. Theodore Saunders, &c. After ! the removal of the cloth, Mr. Wooldeidoe read letters of apology from Mr. ! Baillie Cochrane, M.P. (who was unable to attend ! owing to the state of his health), the Mayors of I Rydo, Yarmouth ?? and Andover, Mr. F. White Popham, Col. Calthorpe, and others. The Chairman briefly proposed tho usual loyal toasts, which were heartily responded to. He then, proposed "The Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces," coupling with the toast the names of CoL Currie, Col. Brandt, and Capt. Brooke Leeds. Col Currik congratulated those present upon adding a pier to the attractions of Sandown ; and then, .speaking to the toast, said he had seen a great deal of war, and what he had aeen of its horrors led him to hope that peace would be maintained, and if it was maintained with honour to the country it J would be the brightest star in the escutcheon of tho j noble lord who now presided over the destinies of the country (applause). Col. Brandt, who also responded, was suro that in the present unfortunate discussion England would do her be&t to be on the right side, and should it end in war the Army, who had never yet been backward when called on, would do va best (applause). God forbid it should end in bloodshed, for he was sure no Englishman wished to *ee that ; all they wished was to see justice and right done (applause). If we did have a peace he hoped it would not be a patijhed-up peac >, but that the question would now be so .settled that there could be no chance of its be- ing brought forward again (applause). Capf. Brook* Leeds, in responding for the Volun- | teers, si id that the corps he commanded owed a great deal to Sandown, and the numbers who had ; joined them from that town enabled them to muater more strongly in proportion than the corps belong- ing to large and important towns. They would not be able to keep the corps up to this position without the help of Sandown. They had ju.st drafted l» Sandown men into the corps, and their band was composed five-tenths of Sandown men. T^eir corps then was virtually, except in name, a Sandown corps. The Volunteers as a body had no politics, and were always ready to do their duty it calkd on ; but they could not forget that, in spite of the many matters of importance which our present Govern- ment had to attend to, they had remembered tho Volunteers. A Volunteer commission had been ap- pointed to take into consideration the wants and requirements of the force. Although the Volunteers hnd their grant there were many other things re- quir d, which would no doubt be supplied (applause). Mr. Daxpier Guild proposed M The Bishop and Clergy of the Diocese and the Ministers of all De- nominations." In spire of certain difference* he thought the Church had the hearty good wishes of all true Englishmen. After regretting the abseuce of the Vicar, he coupled with the toast the names of the Rev. W. M. Harrison to respond for the Bishop and clergy, and the Rev. Mr. King for the ministers of other denomination-!. The Rev. W. M. Harrison said he was extremely pleased to be present on such an auspicious day for Sandown, and he wished their new institution every success. Mi-. Dampier Child had alluded to diffe- rences of opinion in the Church, but he asked where they did not find differences of opinion. It was no when he was a boy, and he supposed always would be i-o ; but he believed that, in spite of differences of opinion, his brethren of the Church and those amongst the Nonconformists were ceming more into accord, and beginning to see that there was not such a great gulf between them but what they could shake hands ever it. He hoped they would give them credit for that, and would see that though they were parsons on Sunday they had their hearty sympathy on all occasions. The Rev. Mr. Kino said he trusted that ministers of all denominations were beginning to see that they were building on one great foundation, and all endeavouring to inculcate one njble principle — giod will towards men. He was very pleased to be present on t-uch an occasion. Having been intimately associated with Saudown for a great number of years in greatly rejoiced him to see its increasing P'O-perity. He believed the construction of the new pier wonld prove a great thing for Sandown, and he hoped that, when completed, it would be crowned with success. Mr. Peixey in eulogistic terms proposed the health of Lady Oglander, who always took such interest in the town, and had given £10 towards the expenses of the day (loud applause and cheers). Capt. Le-.ds re-ponded, and said he wished to tell them what Mr. Wooldridge evidently forgot, that his father, Major Leeds, was unable to be present, and had only been able to attend that afternoon at s >me ri.-ik to himself, for he was very far from well. He thanked them for the hearty way in which tho toast was proposed and received. It was unnecessary for him to dilute on the kindness of Lady Oglander. One could not praise one's own relations very well, but he thought they would remember that it was a very difficult matter for any lady to take part in public matters. When, however, Lady Oglander was asked to open the pier, she at once complied, and although the day was not everything which wished, she came and went through the ceremony (applause). It was a pleasmre foe her to do anything to help Sandown. He then thanked them heartily on her behalf. Mr. L. H. Saumdhrs proposed " Success and Prosperity to the Sandown Pier." He should like to say a few words on the subject, which, as he wad a resident outside Sandown, he hoped would be ac- cepted in all sincerity. The pier so far had been built by a mere handful of men. Fewer men than we** assembled in that room had found the capital necessary to build what was nothing less than an institution — the pier which they had seen so ably opened by Lady Ox lander that day, and he trusted that all those present, who had not yet done so, had decided to become shareholders. The capital re- quired was £6,0 00, in 1,200 shares of £5 each, to build a pier 6o0 feet long, with the object, not only of benefiting the resi ieuts, but of bringing an ad- ditional number of visitors to Sandown. Perceiving the advantages of such a pier a number of the gen- tlemen present had put their hands in their pockets, and mor- than half the capital required had already been subscribed. He thought they ought not to be backward now, for he believed greater profit would accrue uow than at the commencement. The pier as at. pr -sent fiui.-hed was 3-50 feet lonj? and 20 feet wide, and it possessed one advantage which they did not often see. He had been on a great many piers*, and he found seats generally rather scarce, but on the Sandown pier he noticed th-tt *eats ran from end to end, and there was plenty of room for those who could not walk about. He thought that arrange- ment would greatly contribute to the success of the undertaking. All that was wanted now was the means tor providing the remainder of the money re- quired, ami for an outlay of another £2,500 or so they would be able to complete the pier to the length he had mentioned, so that th-y woull always have nine or ten teet of water at the end of the pier, suf- ficient tor steamers to come alongside at all times and take up or put down excursionists. Although they had a ralway to Sandown they wanted some- thing more— accommodation by water, and he hoped to fin'1 no difficulty in doing that. He believed it wasafuctthatallth^prel miuary expensesof thiacom- pany—-getting the Bill in Parliament, <fcc— in f*ct, all their Parliamentary expenst- s, were covered by a cheque for £200 That was sufficient to show that there was no promotion money paid, and he thought such a company, with responsible directors and not overweighted, must be a success. The directors, in addition to the ldige amount of shares they had token, rathe;- than open tho pier with any liability upon it, had given their names and taken a personal liability for £200 each beyond their holding. That showed the sort of opinion the directors had of »ho | undertaking. In proposing rhe to .st he I oped that every Sandown man would take a share. — The toast was received with three times three. The Cii-UKXAX said they were going to carry on the undertaking in an honest, straightforward way and if they only revived support They would nuke the pier oue of the k>t litile properties in the U Qo f Wight. He had upeut a great tkal of tim« and m >ney on the Newport Junction Kail way, and if that

THE EURYDICE. ACROSTIC ON THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

By J. S. Edwards, Sailor on H.M.S. Royal Adelaide.

Each heart was light and hopeful on board that noble ship,  
Unconscious of the danger near before the sundown dip  
Revealing to the light of day, 'midst white sails spread around,  
Youth's gallant form and manhood strong, that now in death are found.  
Dread cloud of woe which overcast their brightest hopes in night,  
Immersing in engulfing death, the brave, the loved, the bright.  
Come England, spread thy gen'rous hand in pity o'er their grave, Endeavouring thus to honour those entombed beneath the wave.

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Lords on Monday,  
Lord Dorchester asked Her Majesty's Government whether any and, if so, what steps had been taken since a first attempt, that failed, to raise H.M. S. Eurydice, sunk off Dunnose on the 24th March last ; whether there had been any consultations relating thereto between the dockyard and other naval authorities, and whether any eminent engineers, civil or military, had been invited to give their opinions ; also whether any firms, such as " The Steamship Salvage Company" or other persons experienced in such matters, had been invited to afford assistance towards or to tender for raiding the vessel ; and whether there was any objection to produce any papers relating thereto. The noble lord said that there were three or four large firms in this country with special appliances for raising ships. One of them had entered into a contract to raise the Vanguard. Within four miles of where the Eurydice was lying a large ship had been raised by one of these firms. He believed that competent authorities denounced the means taken for raising the Eurydice, and it was scarcely creditable to the first maritime Power in the world that the ship should have been lying for ten weeks in ten fathoms of water.

Lord Elphinstone, before answering the question just put to him, wished, in reply to an enquiry made by a noble lord on Friday night, to say that there was to be no naval review off Portsmouth this week. As to the question of the noble lord (Lord Dorchester), he was not surprised at it. Many persons who were interested in the matter were imperfectly acquainted with what was doing and had been done. They were unaware of the difficulties to be overcome, and expressed surprise at the apparent slow progress made in raising the Eurydice. He was very glad the noble lord had given him an opportunity of explaining at somewhat greater length than on previous occasions the difficulties the naval authorities had had to contend against. The question embraced four distinct subjects. With regard to papers, there were really none, except a short daily journal kept by the officer in charge of working parties. This would show better than any words of his the difficulties which had to be encountered. It was made up to the 29th ult., and would show that out of the 67 days since the ship sank the working had only been able to work during portions of 27 days, sometimes for not more than one or two hours out of the 24. During 40 days they had been unable to work at all on account of the weather. The divers had only been able to work 80 hours in all. The lighters had to slip their moorings and run into harbour for shelter no fewer than 11 times, and had to slip again last Saturday. There was no objection to laying that journal on the table. He thought he mentioned on a former occasion that the Admiralty decided from the first that the business of raising the Eurydice should be entrusted to the dockyard authorities at Portsmouth, where there was a most efficient staff of officers, both scientific and practical, who meet in consultation almost daily. They were presided over by the Admiral Superintendent, Admiral FolEy, who was assisted by the Chief Constructor, Mr. Robinson ; Captain Polkinghorne, Master Attendant ; Captain Batt, Master Attendant of Chatham dockyard, who was employed for a considerable time in connection with the operations at the wreck of the Vanguard; Captain Dathan, Captain Moss, and Captain Palmer, Staff Commanders. It would be difficult to get together a stronger or a better Board. They were all agreed in thinking that under the circumstances of the case, and with the appliances at their disposal, no plan could be adopted more likely to ensure success than the one they were at present endeavouring to carry out. They were animated with but one desire, and that was to succeed, and no exertions were being spared in order to attain that result. The Admiralty had not invited the opinion of any civil engineer. The matter was one which the scientific and the pracical skill the Department had at its disposal at Portsmouth dockyard was quite able to deal, and he very much doubted whether there was any civil engineer who had had any experience whatever in raising weights such as that with which the authorities had to deal and under similar circumstances. He need scarcely add that it had not been felt necessary to invite the opinion of any military men. For the same reasons as those which he had already mentioned, they had not invited the assistance of the Steamship Salvage Company or any person experienced in raising vessels, and he was not aware that either the Steamship Salvage Company or, indeed, any other person had any experience in raising vessels under the circumstances of the present case. There were cases of ships having been saved, and, indeed, of having been raised in smooth water and out of a strong tideway, but there was no instance on record of a ship having been raised under circumstances similar to or in any approaching those in which the Eurydice was placed. The only case at all resembling the present was that of H.M.S. Pincher, a schooner of 180 tons, sunk in 14 fathoms of water off the Owers, in 1837, and it was four months before they succeeded in getting her into Portsmouth harbour. The Admiralty had been inundated with offers. Now, as to the steps which were being taken, he would remark that they had to deal with a deadweight of between 400 and 500 tons, lying 12 fathoms below water in a strong tideway, with a current running between four and six knots an hour, and with slack water varying from 30 to 90 minutes. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a spot on the whole coast of Great Britain where greater difficulties existed in regard to such an operation — difficulties not only below water on account of the tide, but also difficulties above water on account of the tide and the weather combined for a nasty sea got up at that spot very quickly with the slightest provocation. The Eurydice sank on the 24th March, and it was not until the 27th April that they were able to make an attempt to move che wreck. They did so by means of two corvettes — the Rinaldo and ihe Pearl — which had been temporarily converted into lighters. That attempt failed on account of the breaking of one of the hawsers, and then, after consultation on the part of the Board to which he had referred, it was determined by the authorities at Portsmouth to adopt what might be called tho over-lift principle, which simply meant that, instead of placing the lighters round the sunken ship as before, they would be placed immediately over her. They would be attached to the wreck by eight steel hawsers toggelled through her main-deck poits, and six jewel hawsers would also be passed round the ship. In addition to that, it was intended to make use of her two bower cables, and also of the Russian air bag, which had a lifting capacity of 40 tons. That would give some idea, of the difficulties which had to be overcome. No fewer than 16 different attachments had to be made, and an equal strain brought to bear upon them all. Should it come on to blow, or any sea get up, those attachments must all be slacked and probably let go, the lighters would have to seek shelter in port, as they had had to do no fewer than 11 times already, and the whole work would have to be begun ever again when the weather settled. But that was not all. It was supposed that the bottom where tho Eurydice sank was hard ground, and so it was. There was a crust of hard ground, but below that was soft, fine sand. It would appear that the ship struck the ground with great force, for her starboard cathead was knocked away and a portion of her keel was sticking out under her stern. The result was that the hard crust was broken, and the ship had been gradually settling in the soft sand. During the late gales she was settling bt the rate of 2in. a day Fortunately she was not settling any more at present. But she was now 11 1/2ft. in the sand, and out of that hole she had to be lifted and placed upon a new bed. That once done the main difficulties would be practically overcome ; and if the weather would only hold up he hoped the work might soon be successfully accomplished, although he was bound to add that he no longer looked upon it as in any way a matter of certainty. But this he would say, that not nil the "eminent engineers," civil or even military, aided by the Steamship Salvage Company or any private firm, could have hastened the raising of the Eurydice by one hour. In conclusion, he had a plan of the manner in which it was sought to raise the ship that he would be happy to show the noble lord.

Lord Dorchester asked whether the attempt to raise her would be more to-morrow.

Lord Elphinstone said that would depend entirely on the weather.

THE EURYDICE.

Ihe gale on Monday night and Tuesday has led to a suspension of the operations at the wreck of the Eurydice. W. H. Smith, rigger diver, and three London divers slept on board the Rinaldo on Monday night, being ordered to commence the work of shackling the toggles immediately the tide answered. The high winds and a rough sea, however, rendered it advisable to return into harbour, and three Government tags were dispatched to bring in the four lighters and the divers' boats. For some time it was impossible to get the tug alongside the Rinaldo for the purpose of taking on board the men employed at the wreck, and one of a tug's crew got overboard and narrowly escaped drowning. After the divers' boats had been taken in tow and were being brought by Bembridge Ledge, where the full force of the gale was felt, one broke adrift, and the three others were considerably damaged, the rigger divers' boat losing its port bow, another most of its after-part, and the other its stern and gunwhale, as well having its diving apparatus disabled. It was not expected that the boats could be floated into harbour, but this difficulty being overcome they were at once put into the dockyard hands for immediate repair, the divers to be supplied with others till they have been rendered serviceable. During the gale, two men were disabled, the engineer of the lighter having his leg broken, and a lighter-keeper sustaining injuries to his face. The Rinaldo being secured to strong moorings was able to ride out the storm. If the weather does not at once abate it will become impossible to take advantage of the high tides of this month. The wreck has already been swept with four 8 inch wire hawsers, and all the toggles intended to be used, numbering about 18, have been introduced into the ports, so that only the toggles have to be shackled, the hawsers jewelled, and the fore and mizen masts removed preparatory to the attempt to float the Eurydice, which, with favourable weather, has been fixed for Sunday or Monday.

THE EURYDICE.

Conettnnom eyries Imo torra—On Wednesday last Mr. Edgar tioble, one of the coroners for Dante, teaclothsl the inquiries into the death of the unfortunate men drowned in the Eurydice. The evhleneo sem confined to that of the survivors, Cuddiford and the boy Sydney Fletcher. There narratives were subetantially the samosa the admitted by them at previous inquiries. Some new facts, however, were Avowed. Clekliferd stated that there was not the slightest ioditation of the spoilt rowing on before the Ship stank, and he did not thiult the wind headed her during the whole time. To the lust the captain mire his orders in a clear and distinct voice, and at the time the ship went down all the ports were open ex c ept tan. They were owned in the forenoon by the acres of the mate of the deck, and the ship at the time she struck was going at about eight knots. From the time the order wax given to ehorten sail to the time she heeled over about six minutes elapsed. From the :hue she heeled over to going down was only a minute, The captain was on deck the whole of the afternoon, and iu witness's opinion everp bite: was done to save the ship. He believed that none of the four guns broke loose. The ship was more lively than usual from the amount of water and provisions but if they had commuted all the water the ship would have been properly ballasted. lie did not believe that Captain Hare was aware that the ports were open. Considering the state of the weather be wane( opinion that the ship was in a wife condition. She was not under too great a prect of trail previous to the storm. Mr. (Afford, a sub-lieutenant, was at the wheel, but there was always a quartermaster there. As a seaman of 21 pars' e xperience, he believed that no blame attached to either officers or men for the loss of the ship. The Coroner, in concluding the inquiry, said the Admiralty did not propose to offer any scientific evidence. It would be for the jury to my whether the captain had caused a proper look-out to kept, because if he had nut it would amount to a neglect of duty, for which he would have had to answer had ho survived. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased came to their deaths by drowning through the foundering of the Eurydice, but that no blame attached to the captain, fficers. or crew. Another body has been recovered from the wreck—that of C. Wilkins, one of the crew, found found in the forechains. In opening the en: quiry, the Coroner (E. Goble, Esq.) observed that the body upon which evidence would be given was supposed to be orte of the crew, of the Eurydice, and his clothes were marked "C. Wilkins." It would be the duty of the jury to ins nine whether the indentity of the deceased' had been proved to their satisfaction, and also to ascertain the cause of death. It was nut his intention at present to go into any further in. quiry. They haul received the verdict of two juries with regard to this catastrophe, and therefore all they need now do was to prove the identity of the body and find the comet of &nth. eiterge foreman of the laborers at the Hospital, said the body was brought to the ads petal thattlay by some laborers of the Dockyard. Ile gave formal evidence as to the chattel which were worn by the decreased, and which Foetid his identity, the name being on the waistband and trousers. The deceased was picked up in the for...chains of Ii.M.S Eurydice. inspector-General Doraville handed in the card trout the Admiralty, stating that C. Wilkins was a seawall on beard the Eurydice —The inquiry was adjourned. During the last few days of fine weather co, .iderable rrogress has been made at the wreck, hoth the wizen and fore masts having been pulled out by the tugs and a spaee cleared for the attachment of the lifting ships. On Tueb. day morning the last of the four lighters was towed out of liArbour to the wreck, and should I nc preaent weather continue, an at. empt to raise the Lurytlieu will ho made to. Tire loss of the Eurydice has set thousands of pens agoing,and many thonsandsof tongues. Many inn varied are the opinions as to the easee of the melaneholy disaster, and it is some satisfaction—mournful it is true—to know that in the opinion of the jury which has enquired into the loss of the Eurydice. the disaster was the result of an accideut and no blame can be attached to the captain or any of the officers or men under him. It was the first thought that the vessel under too great a press of canvas, seeing what the weather was before the squall came on; but the evidence showed that there were two watches, with at least a hundred men in each, that the watch on the deck at the time was plenty to manage the ship, and that had there been more men they would have been in each other's way. Too often disasters of this kind are caused becama. some blundered," hut in this instance everything was done that human foresight and judgment eould direct, and the collision must be attributed solely to a meet direful "freak " Nature, for which the unfortunate victims (-linnet be held responsible. The only consolation is that no one MD be blamed but Nature herself, who cannot he hell amenable to the British laws rind constitution. Bow TO Rates VESSELS. — Writing with regard to the unsuccessful attempts to raise the Eq. !pike, a correspondent says :—.% few yours ago, the Workington, a full-rigged ship of 2,000 tons, laden with (vials, andou tire, was scuttled in the roads, and settled into soft mud, that her topsail yards were only visible above the water. She was bought bye French. man. He at once secured all her top-hamper for staging on which to erect purchases (and did not strip her, as the Eurydice was stripped) to discharge her cargo with and work his divers' pumps from. He had strong Pampero winds, and three or four knot currents to contend against ; however, by working both day and night, and in as bad and exposed position as though the ship had been off the lsle of Wight, he discharged all the cargo of coals, then commenced to fill the hold with wine casks, which were stored below by six divers. The casks had an inch hole bored in each head, then tilled with water and a long spigot placed in the holes, then slung in a chain lowered to the divers (the chains helping to sink the cask) and placed into position by them ; when there they had only to take out both plugs, insert the end of the air nozzle into one hole and blow the water out by the other, then pluugg them both up, when the cask would be tilled with air. Upon one calm day they thus placed 250 casks. They stuck to the job for nine weeks, and brought the ship out of her Led in which she had settled 13 feet deep into the harbour. The tremendous force of the united efforts of the casks had burst her upper deek and so strained her deck beams that they had to be taken out and repaired. The ship, under the name of Perteno, is now afloat, and has made many profitable voyages for her owner. Now, the divers told no they experienced no difficulty while working in the hold from current or rough water. but were only troubled by the darkness and the slippery settlements left on all footing by the sand delimits, of which the hold had at least fifty tons, and this had to be lifted with the iron hull of the ship, iron lower masts, bowsprit, lower yards, and all deckgear. lu another case a wooden brig was cut down by a steamer to the water's edge, and was treated in a like manner, only that the immense hole in her aide had to le planked and covered with canvas. She was succeed- Wily brought into harbour, although seven tailed outside when she went down, and in the channel where the whole force of the river is constantly running at tour to fourandsa-half knots, and not three days without a blow more or less severe.

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Commons on Monday, Mr. David Jenkins said I wish to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty when it is intended to hold a naval inquiry into the loss of her Majesty's ship Eurydice; how it is proposed that the court should be constituted ; and whether he has considered if it would be advantageous to the public service that one or two experts, other than officers in her Majesty's navy, should form part of the oourt : and, whether he inform the House what weight of ballast was put on board when this ship was last commissioned, and of what it consisted; if the water in tanks or any portion of the other stores was relied upon to ensure her stability ; and, if so, what were the nature and weight of such stores.

Mr. W. H. Smith said the court-martial, in accordance with the Navy Discipline Act, has been delayed simply for the purpose of obtaining some valuable evidence as to the condition of the ship before she sank, which it was expected would be forthcoming when the ship was raised. The Board do not permit experts to be placed upon the court, but the court can call any one they choose in order to obtain evidence. The weight of iron ballast the Eurydice carried was 30 tons, the same as she carried previously. As to the last part of the second question, namely, that with reference to water ballast and stores, that will be the subject of inquiry before the court, and it is one to which I cannot give an answer.

Mr. D. Jenkins gave notice that on a future day he should call attention to the subject.

Mr. Baillie Cochrane. M.P. for the Isle of Wight, also asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it seemed impossible to raise the Eurydice, it would not be better to place a buoy over the place where she lies, with some memorial of the gallant men who perished there.

Mr. W. H. Smith : It is not considered to be impossible to raise the ship, and further attempts will he made to do so next spring tides, if the weather permits. To place a buoy over the wreck permanently would be a serious obstruction to navigation. (Hear, hear.)

The salvage operations at the wreck have made considerable progress, favored by a continuance of fine weather, and from Monday till Friday the divers will only be engaged in cutting away such running gear as would be likely to drag on the ground when the ship is raised. The Eurydice has now been swept with four 8-inch steel hawsers, and heavy toggles, with double wire strops, have been introduced into the ports. To these strops 1? inch chain pendants have been shackled on, and when the lift is given the ends of these will be in the mooring lighters. In addition to the 8-inch wire ropes, the bight of an 8-inch wire rope has been dropped before the mainmast into the gangway ports, and the ends poised aft under each quarter have been centred or feilddled under the stern, and will be taken in by the Pearl. In addition to her 8-inch hawsers, the Rinaldo will have the two fore ends of the inch hawser. The Wave and Swan are ready for their work. These two ships will take in as many of the toggle pendants as the ships will ride ever, and all the ships will previously have been sunk three or four feet by allowing that amount of water in them, which will be discharged by powerful steam pumps so soon as the ships have been hove down to the wreck. The Popoff air bag has been placed on the weather side in the gangway and successfully inflated, and the divers have carefully inspected all the toggles and hawsers now they are in position, and report them to be fixed satisfactorily. On Saturday a beautiful inkstand belonging to Captain Hare was recovered by one of the divers, and also a signal log, two white ensigns, and an Italian ensign, all four being unserviceable. On Saturday evening the whole of the divers, riggers and camber men were brought in from the wreck, having succeeded in completing the necessary preliminary arrangements. On Saturday next 400 hands will be taken out to the wreck for the purpose of tightening up the gear and fixing the purchases, and on Monday and Tuesday next, when the tides will have increased upwards of two feet in rise, the first lift will be made. Should the operators succeed in getting the ship out of the hole in which she lies embedded, the lifting vessels, which will be in the first instance placed across the wreck and immersed some two feet, so as to secure an additional rise as the water is pumped out, will then be fastened alongside, and the process repeated until the ports of the Eurydice have been brought above the water level.

THE RAISING OF THE EURYDICE.

Attempts to raise her Majesty's ship Eurydice, lying in the English Channel, off the southern extremity of the Isle of Wight, have at length eventuated in a successful scheme. She was lying in 60ft. of water, and embedded in 111 ft of mud, in which oho was gradually settling down. The alterations on the last plan have been few and simple. Wire hawsers were substituted for two chant so that the arrangements were in the following manor : The sterns of the Wave and the Swan, sad two smaller vessels, which ley &CMS the Eurydice beamwise, pointed towards Culver Oliff somewhat, while the larger vessels, the Pearl and Rinaldo. stood alongside them on the outside, pointing in the opposite direction. The two smaller vowels were each attached to the wreck by means of two toggles, the Rinaldo by two toggles and two j, wel moss, and the Pearl by four jewel roper, sit crossed in such '. manner ac to give the utmost resisting power. The wire hawsers used upon the Weaseled the Swan were both of 7in. diameter, while on the Rinaldo and tie Pearl, there ware two of 7in. and two of Sul. The work carried oat during the last fortnight had been of a very somplicatsd and troublesome character, from the fast that the rope and hawsers on board the four needs feria a very soaping series of interstices ; and whoa *gropes had to be let go a fortnight sins be mesa of the failure of the szpartheats, one mass enmeshment ensued.

THE EURYDICE.

There is to be a final effort made to-day to raise the Eurydice, and if that fails we should fancy the best thing would be to let her stop where she is, a huge coffin for the hundreds of brave fellows who still remain in her. So long a time has elapsed, so fearfully decomposed must be the bodies, that one cannot help asking what the raising of the vessel would do now, and if we consulted our own private inclination we would far rather that the ill-fated vessel remained at the bottom of the sea. What would they do with the ship if they recovered her ? She could never be sent to sea again. Who would care to stop in such a charnel house. We, of course, are not superstitious, but if ever a vessel had dismal associations connected with her, it is the unfortunate Eurydice. Who could stay in a vessel which had been the coffin of 300 or 400 men ? On sanitary grounds, too, it would be bad. She must be by this time sodden with water and the decomposing particles of the unfortunate crew. The sight that will greet the eyes of those who raise her would be horrible, and although we svmpathise with the desire of those who wish to give their relatives decent Christian burial, it should be remembered that it will be impossible to recognise the bodies, except by the marks on their clothing. We do not, however, believe it is possible to raise the ship if it were we do not see what good would be done, and we think the best thing now is not to waste any more money in the farce of trying to raise her. Already more money has been spent than the value of the ship, and to fritter away any more in the fruitless attempts is useless. We notice that the member for the Island, Mr. BAILLIE COCHRANE, entertained the same view, and advocates fixing a buoy over the wreck "as a memorial of the gallant men who lost their lives in their country's service." Another member advocates asking for tenders from outside persons willing to undertake the raising of the ship. We do not imagine that many would care to tender now. Had such a course been adopted directly after the accident occurred, no doubt there would have been tenders offered. Doubtless the company which took the Alpheta off Bembridge ledge would have been successful. There would have been something worth working for, but not now, when the ship is nothing better than a huge sodden charnel house, useless, and only capable of perpetuating mournful reminiscences. The Admiralty refused the preferred help, but there would have been no disgrace in their accepting the assistance of such a reputable firm as are the company who won back the Alpheta to usefulness. The dockyard people study how to I make ships, not how to raise them when sunk, aud there would have been no disgrace if the Admiralty had handed over the job to those who have special knowledge and special appliances. As it is, the public have passed through several stages. First hopeful, next doubtful, aud finally despairing, because they see that the raising of the vessel is no longer a necessity, but would now be tantamount to failure. It was desirable to raise the ship two mouths ago, but not now.

THE EURYDICE.

The salvage operations at the wreck have made considerable progress, favoured by a continumoe of fine weather. During the week the divers have been engaged in cutting away such running gear an would be likely to drag on the ground when the ship is raised. The Eurydice has been swept with four eight-inch steel hawsers, and heavy toggles, with double wire strops, have been introduced into the ports. To these strops 1 ] inch chain pendants have i been shackled on, and when the lift is given the ends j of these will be in the mooring lighters. In addition I to the eight-iucb wire ropes, the bight of an eight- inch wire rope has been dropped before the main- j mast into the gangway ports, and the ends passed aft under each quarter have been centred or feid.iled under the stern, and will be taken in by tho Pearl In addition to her eight-inch hawsers, the Rinuldo will have the two fore ends of the eight-inch hawser. The Wave and Swan are ready for their work, and these two ships will take in as many of the toggle- pendants as the ships will ride over, and all the ships will previously have been sunk three or four f^et by allowing that amount of water in them, which will be discharged by powerful steam pumps so soon as the ships have been hove down to the wreck. The Popoff air bag has been placed on the wea:her side in the gangway and successfully inflated, and the divers have carefully inspected all the toggles and hawsers now they are iv position, and report th»*n_ to be fixed satisfactorily. On Saturday a beautiful ! inkstand belonging to Captain Hare was recovered by one of the divers, and also a signal log, two white ! ensigns, and an Italian ensign, all four being unser- viceable. On Saturday evening the whole of the divers, riggers, and camber men were brought iv from the wreck, having succeeded in completing the necessary preliminary arrangements. To-day (Satur- day) 400 hands will be taken out to the wreck for tho purpose of tightening up the gear aud fixing the purchases, and on Monday or Tuesday next, when the tides will have increased upwards of two feet in rise, the first lift will be made. Sluuld the operators succeed in getting the ship out of the hele in which she lies embedded, the lifting vessels, which will be in the first instance placed across the wreck and immersed some two feet, so as to secure an ad- ditional rise as the water is pumped out, will then be fastened alongside, and the process repeated until the ports of the Eurydice have been brought above the water level. On Saturday the County Coroner held an inquest at Haslar Naval Hospital on the bodies of Charle-i Newbury, gunnery instructor, and Joseph Curtis'., corporal of Marines, both of Gosport. Mr. E. J. Harvey, Admiralty Law Agent at Portsmouth, watched the proceedings on behalf of the Admiralty. The bodies were in a terribly advanced state of de- ?? Coroner explained that he had decided not to re-open the matter, but the Registrar had refused a certificate, and the bodies could not be interred without this or a warrant from himself, and he could not give one without holding an inquisition. Consequently an inquiry was necessary to allow Christian burial to be accorded to the deceased He pointed out that a clergyman could bury without a certificate or a warrant, provided it whs not a sus- i picious death, and was reported within seven days jto the Registrar.— Mr. Harvey said that he had no j doubt instructions to that effect would be given to the Hospital Chaplain.— Two witnesses were then examined, George Carter, labourer, proving the ar- rival of the bodies at Haslar, and giving a descrip- | tion of the clothes they had on, and Benjamin Cud- diford, able-bodied seaman, one of the survivors, identifying the deceased. — The jury returned a ver- dict to the effect that the deceased were dr iwned by the capdzing of H.M.S. Eurydice, and the interment took place in the afternoon. — We understand that as more bodies are recovered from the wreck, they will be identified after being brought ashore, under the direction of an officer appoiutel by the Admi- ralty, and will be buried without any further inves- tigation. In the House of Commons, ou Monday, Mr. Baillie Cochrane asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it seemed impossible to raise the Eurydice, it would not be better to place a buoy over the place where she lies, with some memorial of the gallant men who perished there— Mr. W.ll. Smith : It is not considered to be impossible to raise the ship, and further attempts will be made to do so next spring tides, if the weather permits. To place a buoy over the wreck permanently would be a seri- ous obstruction to navigation (hear, hear). — Captain Pirn asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it appears that the Eurydice cannot be raised by the means at the disposal of the Admiralty, he would invite tenders from parties willing to contract with the Admiralty to raise and deliver the Eurydice afloat in Portsmouth harb-ur —Mr. W. H. Smith thought it undesirable to answer the questiou con- tingently. He might say he had no present inten- tion of inviting tenders— Mr. I). J. Jenkins asked the First Lord of the Admiralty when it was in- tended to hold a naval inquiry into the loss of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice; how it proposed that the Court should be constituted ; whether he had con- sidered if it would be advantageous to the public service that one or two experts, other than officers in Her Majesty's Navy, should form part of tha*, Court; and whethor he could inform the House what weight of ballast was put on board when that ship was last commissioned, and of what it consisted ; whether the water in tanks or any portion of the stores was r-iied upon to iisure her stability ; and, if so, what was the naturo and weight of such stores. —Mr. W. H. Smith : A court-martial in accordance with the Naval Discipline Act has been ordered to assembh to inquire iuto the loss of the Eurydice, and the meeting of the Court is ouly deferred in ex- pectation of obtaining some valuable evidence of the condition of the ship before she sank. The law d ie» not admit of experts being placed on the Court but the Court has power to call before it any porsu-i whom in their judgment they think it desirable to give evidence. The weight of ballast was 30 tons of iron pig ballast, the same as she carried on all former commissions The : last part of the second questiou will be a subject of inquiry by the Cou't.

THE EURYDICE FAILURE TO LIFT THE SHIP.

In accordance with the programme settled by Admiral Superintendent the Hon. F. A. C. Foley, in connection with the attempt to raise the Eurydice, which it was hoped might be made on Monday morning. The riggers and divers proceeded to the wreck as early as three o'clock on Saturday morning, and the Pearl corvette, and the gunboats Swan and Wave, having been towed out to join the Rinaldo, every advantage was taken of the lull to place the lifting vessels into position and attach them by the purchases across the wreck. The Pearl was placed at the stern to receive the ends of the jewel hawsers, the gunboat toggled on either side of the mainmast, the Rinaldo being reserved for the tow jewels to be made fast to. The corvette and small craft were suocesfully lashed down, but on Sunday morning the wind shifted to the south-west, and the heavy lop, which sprang up, caused the Pearl to pitch to such an extent as to cause her nine inch hawser to part, and she had eventually to be eased to prevent her getting wholly loose, nothwithstanding that the violent thunderstorm which ensued had the effect of materially beating down the swell. The gunboats were allowed to remain in position in spite of the long roll which continued during the afternoon, though from the manner in which they struck against the mainmast it might be considered necessary to ease them off. At noon on Sunday the wind, which had been singularly variable, veered round to the north-west, and should it have the effect of moderating the sea it was the intention of Captain Moss to place the Rinaldo in position forward and secure her to the purchases. At three o'clock in the afternoon 90 men from the Asia, under the command of Staff-Commander Parker, and other contingents from the ships in the harbour assembled in the dockyard, where tugs were ready to take them to the wreck for the purpose of heaving round the capstans by which the lifting ships were to be pinned down at early slack on Tuesday morning ; but on Rear-Admiral Foley, who had been out personally superintending the operations, coming on there, the orders were countermanded and they were dismissed. The result was the loss of another day, the first actual lift which was appointed to be made on Monday morning at ten, being postponed until the some time on Tuesday.

There was a slight breeze blowing from the south-east on Monday, but it was not powerful enough to have any effect on the sea, and the glass was rising. The four lifting vessels were moored exactly in the positions where they were wanted to receive the purchases, and Mr. W. B. Robinson (Chief-Constructor), and a staff of officers, were at the wreck superintending the imniersions of the ships by letting in the water. During Monday afternoon the toggle pendants were successfully attached to the gunboats Swan and Wave, and the bow end of the steel hawser made fast to the Rinaldo ready to hove down. The Lord Warden which was to take up the the towing ropes at high water on Tuesday arrived under sail from Portland, and was anchored in Sandown Bay, and there were besides no fewer than six steam tugs to render whatever assistance may be required. Rear-Admiral Foley was present at the operations the whole day, and remained out all night having about 400 employed under him in the final pinning down of the lifting vessels. They commenced work at three o'clock on Tuesday morning, and completed the work of pinning down the Wave and Swan gun-boats and the Pearl and Rinaldo, corvettes, by six o'clock, water ballast having been let into each of the ships so as to subemerge them three feet. The lowest tide was at a quarter to six and the steel wire hawsers and chain cables were hove taut by six o'clock. Half an hour later the work of pumping on the four craft was commenced by four tugs with the addition of two of Merryweather's steam fire engines, on the Pearl and Rinaldo. At this time the wind was blowing moderately from the N. E., and the sea was comparatively calm. The pumping occupied two hours but while it was proproceeding the wind shifted to E N.E. and a heavy swell set in. Shortly after 8 o'clock the force of the wind had so much increased as to interfere consiiderably with the operations, and at the time the after chain of the White Swan, attached to a toggle, snapped, and it was found necessary to slip the other chain in order to save the gunboat. While this was being done the sea became so very choppy that, at twenty minutes to nine o'clock, it was found necessary to use the hawsers. Shortly afterwards, the swell continuing to increase, orders were given for all the hawsers and toggles to be slipped, and Admiral Foley directed the return of the craft into harbour. During the operations the White Swan got her quarter much damaged by colliding with one of the tugs, and a workman sustained some injuries. The operations were directed by Capt. Polkinghorne, Batt and Dathan, under the supervision of Admiral Foley. On Tuesday morning the Commander-in-Chief (Admiral E. G. Fanshawe, C.B.) with Flag-Captain the Hon W C. Carpenter, arrived at the wreck in the Fire Queen. The Medina, gunboat, also brought out a party, including Lord Elphinstone (representing the Admiralty) and the of Athole. In consequence of the unfortunate change in the weather another attempt cannot be made for a fortnight and it is doubtful whether the interval would suffice to make the requisite pteparations.

The *Portsmouth Times* thinks that it is extremely probable that the attempt to raise the vessel will be abandonded.

Another body was picked up at the wreck on Tuesday morning.

ATTEMPT TO RAISE THE EURYDICE.

It was hoped that, with fine weather, the programme arranged by Admiral Superintendent the Hon. A. Foley, assisted by Captains Polkinghorne, Batt, and Dalham, would be attended with success, and that the ill-fated Eurydice would be recovered. It had been arranged that the supreme effort should be made on Monday morning, but the unfavourable weather experienced on Sunday necessitated a day's delay. Monday was occupied in performing preliminary work which had been postponed from the previous day, and up to Monday night everything went on smoothly. Rear-Admiral Foley was present at the operations the whole day, and remained out all night, having about 400 men employed under him in the final pinning down of the lifting vesels. They commenced work at 3 o'clock on Tuesday morning, and completed the work of pinning down the Wave and Swan gunboats and the Pearl and Rinaldo corvettes by 6 o'clock, water ballast having been let into each of the ships so as to submerge them three feet. The lowest tide was at a quarter to 6. and the steel wire hawsers and chain cables were hove taut by 6. Half an hour later the work of pumping out the four craft was commenced by four tugs, with the addition of two of Merryweather's steam fire engines on the Pearl and Rinaldo. At this time the wind was blowing moderately from the north east, and the sea was comparatively calm. The pumping occupied two hours, but while it was proceeding the wind shifted to east-north-east and a heavy swell set in. Shortly after 8 o'clock the force of the wind had so much increased as to interfere considerably with the operations, and at the time the after-chain of the Swan, attached to the boggle, snapped, and it was necessary to slip the other chain in order to save the gunboat. While this was being done, the sea became so choppy that at twenty minutes to 9 it was found requisite to ease the hawsers. Shortly afterwards, the swell continuing to increase, orders were given for all the hawsers and toggles to be slipped, and Admiral Foley directed the return of the craft into harbour. During the proceedings the Swan got her quarter much damaged by collision with one of the tugs, and a workman sustained some injuries. On Tuesday moming the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral E. G. Fanshawe, C B., with Flag Capt. the Hon. W. C. Carpenter, arrived at the wreck in the Fire Queen. The Medina, gunboat, also brought out a party, including Lord Elphinstone, representing the Admiralty, and the Duke of Athole. In consequence of the unfortunate change in the weather, another attempt cannot be made for a fortnight, and it is doubttul whether the interval would suffice to make the requisite preparations. It is thought extremely probable that the attempt to raise the vessel will be abandoned. Another body was picked up at tbe wreck on Tuesday morning. The Lord Warden left the scene of the wreck on Tuesday afternoon, for Portland, and nothing has been done since worth recording.

THE EURYDICE. THE VESSEL SUCCESSFULLY LIFTED.

Admiral Superintendent the Hon. F. A C. Foley ras engaged at the wreck on Monday, and under is directions the Rinaldo, Pearl, Wave and Sw in, .•hich are to take part iv the lifting of the submerged tall, were placed in position without- any misadven- ure. Tin pinning down of the vessels was contin- icd during the night, and at G o'clock next morn- ng-, when low water, th=j operation of lifting was ommenced by the pumping of the water ballast out >f the lifting craft. The Thunderer, turret ship, Uaptaiu J. C. Wilson, arrived off Dunnose, from ?ortlaud, to tow the wreck into shallow water. Early on Tues lay morning the locale of the sunken vreck pre-cnted a scene of considerable animation. Hie weather was as tine as could have been wished lor, and a stranger could hardly have supposed ;hat a spot where perfect calm prevailed, the sea jeing quite smooth, had been the scene of a catastro- ohe of such an appalliug character. Admiral Foley End been hard at work during the priveous day, md remained at the wreck during the night, having willing and able coadjutors in Captains Polking- t.orne, Dathan, Batt, and Moss, Mr. W. B. Robinson, __iief constructor at Portsmouth, aud Mr. J. Purkis, dockyard foreman. The alterations of the last plan were few and simple. Wire hawsers had been sub- stituted for chains wherever chains had been pre- viously tried. The steras of Wave and Swan, two smaller vessels lay across the Euryd.ce beam wise, pointed towards Culver Cliff somewhat ; while the larger vess-ds, Pearl and Rinaldo, stood alongside of them on the out side, pointing in the opposite direction. The two smaller vessels were each attached to the wreck by means of two toggle », Rinaldo by two toggles and two jewel ropes, and Pearl by four jewel ropes, all crossed in such a manner as to give the utmost resisting power. The wire hawsers used upon Wave and Swan were both of seven-inch diameter, while on Rinaldo and Pearl were two of seven-inch and two of eight-inch. The lifting vessels, Pearl, Rinaldo, Wave, and Swan, with the Popoff air-bag, which is calculated to have a raising power of about 50 tons, were got into position near the wreck on Monday, and at 1 o'clock on Tue>day morning operations were resumed. Previous inves- tigations by the divers had shown that the hull of the Eurydice was imbedded to the exteut of about I lift., and when the work was vesumed on Tuesday morniuir, with every prospect of a continuance of favourable weather, the chief officials were sanguine that, barring unforseen accidents, the wreck would be removed from its cradle. At L o'clock, the tide '-eing about flood, the work of letting water ballast into the craft, which had beeu pinned down in order to submerge them the registered depth, was com- menced : 924 tons of water were pumped into PearJ, until, with a depth in her hold of 10ft. she was sunk oft. 6in. Rmaldo was made to hold 600 tons, with an internal depth of Oft. and external oft. ; while Wave and Swan were immersed 3ft. 6in. by means of 190 tons of water in each. By the time this wa. finished there was rather less than an hour to spare before it was dead low water, an ' in this interval every thing being made indubitably secure, by half-past o every body was waiting for an indication of the turn of the tide. When it had fairly turned the steam fire engines on board Pearl and Rinaldo were set vigorously to work, and wi h the aid of the double hose were pumping the water very fairly, when the experiment proved so success- ful that a steam tug- was sent alongside of each of these two vessels each with double hose to assist. This had been going on for about half an hour, when a tug was sent in between Wave and Swan in order to pump them. The wreck lay in 60f c. of water, and having by this time accumulated so much dead weight, to lift her at once to the surface would have been simply impracticable. The nature of the scheme of rescue, therefore, was. to raise her 10ft. by means of a loft, tide, plus whatever could be gained by the creation of buoyancy and brino-in^ to bear of additional lifting power. Therefore, supposing her to be lifted 1 0ft by the tide and oi u by the buoyancy created by pumping the water ut of the vessels, and so lifting her with th\.i>* f v.° would be a lift of loft., oniy 34ft. mo*- nT* fi™ depth of the hole in which she~w&, ' £ J?,? "J? was accordingly agreed th^ ??

Having reported favour- ably, the pumping operations were watched with great interest, more especially as the wreck s mast came up at first, simultaneously with the lighters, and ultimately began to gain ot. them considerably. -By 8 o'clock the green seaweed on the wreck's ma*t had gradually become more conspicuous, and showed evident signs of her increasing buoyancy, > and by half-.past 9 the water had been pumped from all the lighters, and Eurydice shook her m*st occasionally, it was then determined to let well alone for the time, and wait for an improvement iv the tide, seeing that the rising water was liftiag the sunken craft so steadily and well. Thunderer was at hand waiting for her opportunity. Unfor- tunately she swept across the tide, and lost her cables and gear. This necessitated some delay, inasmuch as it took up valuable time in creeping for the hawsers. One was speedily recovej«d, but it required the work of a diver to find the- other. The second, however, was to have been dispensed with, and a rope hawser substituted; but as. Thunderer was about steaming towards the scene o£ operations her capstan fell overboard, carrying the Kne. Meauwhile experiments have been going on to test the buoyancy of the wreck. The hawsers facing Culver Cliff were drawii up taut, aacl those at the stern were slackened. This operation was continued for some time, under difficulties, ia being alrao-t im- possible to haul in the bow ropes, in consequence of what appeared to be the immovability of tue wreck. But sud lenly tbe cap.tana on adi the vesst ls worked easily, the wreck was seeifl to move, and the tars cheered lustily. The Thunderer having now be- come useless for all practical purposes for the day, the experiment with the hawsers was continued un- til it was deemed, advisable to send down divers to report the state *>i affairs. They reappeared with the r port that the Eurydice had been shifted out of the hole aud moved from 150 to 180 feet, and that she now rested on a solid foundation. The weather continued fine on Wednesday, aud the officials worked with a will. The programme, already described, was gone through again, b ing. commenced at 3 a.m., and everythiug went on satis- factorily. By means of water ballast, the 3<.arl and Rinaldo were each submerged 4ft. Gin., aud the Swan and Wave 4ft. The lifting commenced at 6 o clock, aud at 9 the wreck began to move towards the shore, and it was thought great progress would be made. In consequence of the mishap to the Ihunderer's capstan on Tuesday, the turret ship was not brought mto requisition, but tugs were employed to a sist in towing the moving hull in shore. Alter satisfactory progress had been made a steel wire jewel used in founer experiments, but which had oe n superceded, fouled an anchor, preventing fur- , ther progress for the day, and the wreck was grounded on a bank m 10 fathoms at low water, bein<»- 400 yards nearer land than before. The practical operations commenced on Thursday j at 8 o clock, and the lifting and forward movement I went on most successfully up to 2 o'clock. The ; actual results accomplished are as follows- The j luirydice has been moved forward in un easterly ; direction one mile and four-tenths of a mile She lies with a ,» list " between the Swan and the Wave, with the Rinaldo and the Pearl outside, all closely lashed together by strong hawsers. Her maintop ate out of water, and show unmistakeablc signs of h9r long detention in the " vasty deep," from which m c trust she has now finally parted company. The expectancies as regards further progress are that the next forward movement by to-day's (Friday) tide will be made broadside on to the tide.

THE EURYDICE.

The lifting operations were suspended on Friday for the re-arrangement of the plan hitherto adopted. Iron plates have been manufactured for taking off the rubbing effects on the sides of the sides of the Eurydice, and were taken out of harbour in the afternoon to be fixed in position. On Friday morning at low tides the quarter-davits of the sunken vessel were visible and it was officially ascertained that she was within a mile of the Culver Cliff, entirely out of the tide way, so that she will not be in danger even should the weather take an unfavourable turn It was not expected that the actual lifting of the wreck can be proceeded with before this day, but of every moment was utilised by divers to clear the decks as far as practicable, and they have been busily engaged in preparing to cut away the mainmast. Orders have been issued regulating the steps to be taken for the recovery of valueable property so soon as the ship shall be pumped dry. A lieutenant, two warrant officers, a dockyard detective and a ship's steward have been appointed for this purpose, except for special moans, no persons will be permitted to enter the cabins until search has been made. Particubx attention is to be paid to the recovery of the public chest and of large onus of money believed to be in possession of the ship's corporal and a lieutenant in the itoyal Engineers, who were on board. The Dockyard officials are preparing comparative list of weights carried by the Lurydic . e in her commissions of 1846, 1846 and 1877, and oho descriptive drawings of her angle stability, for the purpose of the tourt-martial. We had hoped to have been able to record the fact that the Eurydice was safe in Portsmouth Harbour at the time of going to press with our present issue, but it seems that a little more delay is necessary. On Monday evening the ehipwirght department of Portsmouth Dockyard finished their part of the work of adapting the Peed, Rinaldo, Wave, and Swan to the new place of lifting the wreck from the sides, 100 men having been engaged upon these vessels throughout Sunday. Much, however, remains to be done in the way of strengthening the sides of the craft with wooden balks, and it is not expected that the necessary preliminaries can be completed before Friday or miturday. The Peral will be located on the port side of the Eurydice, and alongside her, for the purpose of increasing her stability, will be the Swan ; whilst the Rinaldo and the Wave will be similarly platted on the starboard side. The wreck will not, as heretofore, be swept with hawsers, the lift having to be effected entirely by means of 16 toggles, eight being fixed in position on each side, secured by Tin. wire hawsers, each capable of standing a strain equivalent to a hundred tons. Though not altogether out of the tide, the Eurydice is in water that is less in the run of the tide, and this will be highly advantageous in rendering the lifting vessels more manageable than has hitherto been the came. It is intended to lift the Eurydice with successive tides as high tie may be found practicable, then to cloge up her ports and hatchways, and afterwards to pump her dry, when she will flo.tt to W the surface b lt y virtue of her own bouyancy. ith this resu attained the salvage operations will be completed and the wreck will undergo a thorough fumigation before being brought into harbour. On Monday the Manly tug brought a body into harbour, and a chest of drawers and a cashbox were also recovered from the unfortunate frigate. THE MAINLAND. BY WATCHMAN. Messrs. Hunt and Hance, the well-known auctioneer . 1 Lind have made a hit in reviving the stock fairs in the district of Beaulieu. The sales will bo chiefly for lambs and wool, and will be held four times a year. Thu first, held on Monday, was a s ignal IMOCW, the following stock being entered for vale in the cattle yards said meadow adjoining the Montague draw :—Sheep, 377 ; lambs, 217 ; horned cattle. 41 ; ram lambs, 50 ; pedigree stock o f Devon beasts, bred by Mr. Biel. 15; pigs, 32 ; boreal, 13; and fleeces of wool, 1,300. Of course a lu nch eon was a sow own in the pragramme of inch a gathering, and I am not guilty of over gallantry in Baying that Miss Lane, the landlady gained the complete approbation of the numerous e . n u a:rj e - rs - all Judges of cuisine. The supplemented the repast with a good supply of wise. Mr. Cabin, steward to Lord Henry Scott, ably presided, and the toast list was disposed of with despatch on account of the business to follow. The toast of the Auctioneers was war received in a manner which mast have been very gratifying to the firm. I should Mos to reproduce the good things that were said, but I am reminded that there are limits to even newspaper columns, and I must content myself with giving the following manila of the rale :—Fat withers, 628. to 675. ; fat ewes, 50a. to Me. ; store togs, 50s. ; fat lambs, 355. to 50s. ; store lambs, Me. to 35e, Mr. J. W. Biers Fortedows ram lambs and Mr. W. Biers improved Hampshire Down lambs sold readily at at 3to 4 gains's,. They were beautiful lambs. The superior Down p edigree calves, also bred by Mr. J. W. Biel, were - in demand for 5 to 7 guineas each —and yearlings 12 to 14 guineas. Fat beasts, £l7 to 11 , 31 ; heifers in calf 1:11 to £l6 ; cows and calves, V 5 ; store stoers, £1 . 2 to £lslos ; store pigs, 13s. to 19s. 6d. The wool, which war a new feature in this aale, and was of very es cellent quality, commanding 15 for togs and 15i for Down ewes. Beer drinkers will be pleased to learn that th Lop gardens In Hants ancl Surrey are looking well s 14dthis must be set the tact that in Sumer and u tent matters are not quite so promising, blight being apprehended. On Monday • terrific dorm of wind, thunder and lightning broke over South a mpton. Many bonsai were flooded and the Wesleyan Church was much damaged. Among other naval items I learn that the Euphrates, Indian troopship, is ordered to proceed on a fortnight's coestvrisc service this week. The Sultan, late flagship of the Duke of Edinburgh, is to be supplied with torpedo gear, and the requisite mcliminary arrangements are in progress. On Friday en Admiralty order was received at Portsmouth Dockyard for all the hired men, in addition to those voted In the estimates for the years, to be discharged at the expiration of a month, and for all overtime in the yard to be discontinued after Saturday. The Dreadnought turret-ship is being kept under steam for a week, for the purpose of testing her ventilating fans, boat winches, turret engines and hydraulic pumps. lu the military world the Duke of Cambridge reviewed the whole of the troops in Portsmouth Garrison, preliminary to the disbanding of the Army Reserves. After the inspection, the divisor marched past In double column of companies, in mars, and in line of quarter brigade. They then re-formed on the original alignment, advanced in line, and presented arms, after which the combined bands played the National Anthem. His Royal H:glinesa at tbg close of the review, called the commanding officers to the front, and expressed unqualified satisfaction in the physique and drill of the men. The Duke of Cambridge afterwards proceeded to Winchester. • Iron Duke is, by an Admiralty order received at Portsmouth, ordered to call at the port on Monday next far her atom pinnace and Mitebad Wanda&

This done, the divers were set to work to e"scor the ports on the lee side, which are about t.oree feet below water at low title, a party of .:iirwrighte were sent to cover the ports on the last side, which are now out of water. In the mare of Monday eleven more bodies were discovered. They were found on the main deck, in, .of couree. the most shocking condition.

At low water the upper put of the poet bilge was out of water, and a party of ninety sea no. began to clear the upper deck and to float the ..otter and the crew's boat, whilst the Adniiral- Superintendent and luspottor.Getieral Danville managed to penetrate into the captain'a cabin and also the weather chins, but found no bodies in dam.

TWO BODIES FOUND.

On Saturday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, two bodies were washed ashore near to Sir William Hutt's pier at Apley ; one of the bodies was headless, but a human head was found floating near the spot. The bodies were in a very advanced state of decomposition, and almost nude, so that there were no means of identification ; but there is little doubt that they were from the ill-fated Eurydice. Coffins were procured, and the bodies conveyed by the Coastguard to the mortuary at the Cemetery. At half-past 5 in the afternoon the funeral took place at the north side of the Cemetery. Palls were thrown over the coffins, which were carried, shoulder high, by eight Coastguardsmen, under the superintendence of Mr. Jefferys, the chief officer. They were met at the grave (both being interred in one) by Mr. Westhall, a gentleman residing in Ryde, who read portions of Scripture. and afterwards addressed the large concourse of people, remarking that it was a very solemn occasion, and took their thoughts back to the 24th March, when about 300 poor men and boys were drowned by the capsizing of the Eurydice; the bodies of two of them were in the coffins before them ; there were no names on the coffins, but the men were known to God. He nothing of their history, and he did not know whether they were Christians, and he had nothing to do with that. They were surrounded by mysteries ; even their own existence was a mystery, and it was a most mysterious thing that the poor creatures who were drowned would have been on land in about an hour, and would have boon welcomed by loving friends; but it was not to be. They could not understand it, but the light of eternity would interpret all mysteries, and all they had to do was to bow to the will of God, for would not the Judge of the whole earth do right? The lesson for all of them to learn was the uncertainty of human life. Those who were drowned were in good health and spirits a few minutes before, and then were called to their final account. There were these present who evidently had sympathy for those who had been thus taken suddenly away. Although they were taken thus suddenly, it was possible they might have been able to give one look to the Saviour, and there was life in a look. It did not take long to save the thief on the cross, and they might hope that many in the Eurydice were saved, and he was glad to believe that many on board loved the Saviour. Mr. Westhall concluded the simple, but very impressive, service by offering prayer and pronouncing the benediction. There was something exceedingly affecting in witnessing the two plain, nameless coffins placed in the grave, and no friends or relatives near to pay the last tribute of affection ; and also in the thought that until the morning of the resurrection it must remain a profound secret as to who was interred in Ryde Cemetery on Saturday afternoon.

THE EURYDICE.

Continuing our narrative of the operations with the wreck of the Eurydice, we have to record a  
THREATENED BREAK UP.

On Thursday evening a gale set in from the east and continued on Friday morning, leading to a further suspension of the salvage operations. The waves broke over the wreck. causing her to oscillate violently, and at daylight it appeared that the hull would be considerably damaged by the high wind and the rough sea. The flow of the water through the ports and down the hatchways quickly began to snap the planks of the upper deck, and a tremendous strain was thrown upon the hull generally, leading to the general apprehension that she would come to pieces. The Rinaldo and a lighter were sent into harbour, and instructions were given for the Pearl to follow, and all the steam tugs were ordered out with all practicable speed to render assistance in recovering bodies and wreckage. Four bodies were picked up from the main deck at low water under considerable difficulties, and two others were washed ashore at Shanklin, while several were reported as floating past Bembridge Point and down the Channel.

The dockyard officials directing the operations did all they possibly could to lessen the extent of the damages to the wreck of the Eurydice, but on Thursday evening the greater part of the upper deck had gone, and if a gale had blown throughout the night the chances were that the hull would have gone to wreck. The dangerous portion of the wreck is thoroughly recognised by the Admiral-Superintendent, the Hon. F. A. C. Foley, and the scientific officials in charge of the operation, no moment has been lost in hermetically fastening up the hull, pumping her out, and clearing her decks.

As might be expected thousands of visitors and residents in various parts of the Island have visited Sandown in order to indulge in a sight of the ill-fated Eurydice, which has been beached about a cable's length from the shore off Redcliffe Bay which is contiguous to the Culvers. There was a rather rough sea running into the bay on Thursday, and on that day the body of a man was washed ashore not far from the beached frigate. The body was in a better state of preservation than some picked up three months ago. The flesh on the hands could be seen, though nearly black, but that of the face had almost entirely disappeared. Under the collar of the poor fellow's serge was stamped "W. Shuker," which is supposed to be the name of the wearer. It was intended to inter the body near those of his comrades lying in Sandown churchyard. There has ben another body washed ashore near Luccombe during the week, and is supposed to be that of an officer, but there is difficulty in indentification. Two more bodies were picked up near Apley on Saturday morning, and interred in Ryde Cemetery in the afternoon. Particulars of the ceremony will be found in our local news. Another was also recovered on Sunday.

THE OPERATIONS AT THE EURYDICE.

After the departure of the Rinaldo on Friday afternoon, the wind increased in violence, aud it was found expedient to bring the Pearl and the tugs into the harbour. With the exception of the Grinder, which had on board Lieut. Wonham, who was left in charge of the wreck, the Eurydice was wholly deserted. Happily the wind went round slightly to the north, or the wreck must have gone to pieces. Ou Sunday, though the wind continued to blow freshly from the southward— and thus the least favourable for the resumption of operations— the Pearl was again taken out to Sandown Bay and the tugs were once more on the spot. Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, the Controller of the Navy, and Rear-Admiral Foley, the Superintendent of the of the Dockyard, paid a visit to the scene of the wreck in the morning. Operations were continued on Monday. The six steel hawsers were passed across and under the ship's keel in readiness, divers having been down and inserted toggles in three of the starboard ports. The steel pendants attached were not only useful to assist in lifting the wreck, but were of service in righting the ship to some extent from tho angle at which she heeled over to starboard. On Monday evening the Royal yacht Osborne steamed into Sandown Bay and brought up near the Eurydice. On board were the Prince and Princess of Wales, Prince Albert Victor and Prince George, in the uniforms of naval cadets, and the three little Princesses, with ladies and gentlemen in attendance. One of the Osborne's boats was lowered, and the Prince of Wales in naval uniform, with the captain commanding the Osborne, and other officers and gentlemen, were rowed to the Eurydice. The officers who were in charge of her at the time were Staff-Captain Dathan, Staff-Captain Batt, Commander Moss, and Lieut. Wohnam. His Royal Highness clambered up the side of the wreck, and remained some time in conversation with these officers, taking much interest in their description of what had been accomplished and of their plan for future operations. The captain of H.M.S. Valorious, which has been attending on the other ships in Sandown Bay, was also on the wreck during the Prince's visit. The Osborne steamed out of the bay about 6 o clock on her return to Osborne.

On Wednesday, operations were continued at the wreck of the Eurydice, and the results winch attended than augurs well for the ultimate success of the endeavours to raise the vessel. The wind, which, during the last few days, had persistently blown from a quarter which was least desirable, fell off considerably during Tuesday night, and on Wednesday morning the working party were enabled to proceed with the task which had recently been so frequently delayed by the boisterous weather. The authorities, seeing the exposed position in which the Eurydice was placed in Sandown Bay, had for some time contemplated removing the wreck round the corner of the Isle of Wight, as a temporary measure, so as to be out of the way of the heavy sea which sets in at this point whenever there is stiff breeze blowing, and accordingly on Wednesday operations were resumed with this intent. It was low water about 11 in the morning, and the arrangements for slinging the vessel, the insertion of toggles, and the passing round of hawsers having been accomplished by that time, the lift was commenced as arranged . Previously the Pearl and Rinaldo was secured to tie the Eurydice on either side, and to counterbalance the strain which would be brought to bear upon them when the lift was begun the gunboats Wave and Swan were lashed on the outside of the two ships. As the tide rose the lift was satisfactorily effected, and the two Government tugs Camel and Grinder, which were in readiness, took the wreck and lifting craft in tow. The flotilla was slowly but satisfactorily brought round the corner of the Isle of Wight, and during the afternoon the Eurydice was grounded in St. Helen's Roads, where it was thought to leave her for the present. The vessel is now in 24ft. of water, and when the tide is full low the depth will be reduced about 8ft. more. On Thursday efforts were made to get the wreck sweetened somewhat, as the putrefaction of the bodies on board would render it highly undesirable for the ship to he brought into a place crowded with craft in her present unsanitary condition. After this has been done the wreck will be agaim lifted and towed into Portsmouth Harbour, the idea of pumping her out being now abandoned, in consequence of the ship having been so knocked about during the recent gales.

THE EURYDICE.

Since our last issue the wreck of the Eurydice has been removed from the exposed position in Sundown Bay to more sheltered quarters west of St. Helen's fort. As the tide rose the hull was lifted and taken in tow by the two Government tugs, Camel and Grinder, and the flotilla slowly moved round the corner of the Island, and on Wednesday afternoon the Eurydice was grounded in St. Helen's Roads ; the vessel was in 24 ft. of water, which was reduced about 8ft. at ebb tide. It was then thought desirable to disinfect the wreck, as the putrefaction of the bodies rendered it very undesirable to place the ship among other craft. The idea of pumping out was thought to be impracticable, on account of the injury done to the ship by the gales which had prevailed

INQUIRIES IN PARLIAMENT.

In the House of Commons on Thursday evening Mr. Jenkins called attention to the keg of the Eurydice. His opinion was that when the ship left England she was neither properly ballasted nor provided with sufficient stability to enable her to encounter heavy weather with security. He was not prepared to say that on that account the ship was unseaworthy ; but she was in such a condition as to require the utmost skill in handling her to avoid disaster. He was told on good authority that when the ship was beating out of Stornoway, before her last voyage, her performances under canvas led certain people to predict that, should she encounter any extraordinary weather the result would be disastrous. The ship depended largely for her stability upon the ballast afforded by her consumable dares, which was very unreliable. Her tanks could not have been full when she was lost. He was convinced that no officer of experience was on deck when she was struck by the squall, and if his memory served him rightly nearly all the ships lost to her Majesty's Navy for some years past were lost when they were in charge of junior officers.

After a few words from Colonel Beresford and Mr. Muntz, Mr. A. Egerton said he thought this was hardly an opportune time for raising the question, since in a few days a thorough inquiry would be opened. The ship was as carefully prepared for the service for which she was intended us any ship that ever left the dockyard. She was never regarded as unsafe. The weight of her tanks was 110 tons, and she carried 30 tons of ballast as well. This was the weight she had always carried before. She was not overmasted. Her officers, from the captain downwards, were most carefully selected, and were all men who had had considerable experience. As to the training of lieutenants, it was the custom to give them charge of gunboats and small draft boats before they were promoted to iron ships. It was hoped that in a very short time she would be in harbour, and then a thorough examination, which was no doubt necessary, would take place pending which he deprecated criticism on the conduct of any person on board that ship.

A PADDLE BY NIGHT TO THE EURYDICE.

I THINK that amongst the many sad catastrophes of last year there was not one so fearful and so sudden as that of the ill-fated Eurydice. We live in the island, and immediately opposite to the place where she went down, and were the last to see her in her beauty five minutes before she was lost. The day had been tolerably fine and warm, though at times we had a cold gust of wind accompanied by a few flakes of snow. We had had lucheon at Shanklin, and were returning to our house at Sandown, by the Cliff pathway, when we noticed a tremendous storm coming straight from the mainland, at the same time as the Eurydice was just rounding the point, in full sail, and scudding before the wind. Alter remaining for a few minutes to watch her, as the light just caught her sails and made a beautiful picture, my friend exclaimed, "Good Heavens what are they thinking about, not to shorten sail, with such a cloud as that coming up Every other vessel in sight has done so, and there'll be mischief if they carry on like that in the squall." The words were scarcely spoken before the storm was upon us, and we were enveloped in a mist of whirling snow and sleet, and had to cling tightly to the railings to avoid being blown over the Cliff. The storm was so violent that it was impossible to see a yard, and as we had quite enough to do to look after ourselves, we never thought of the ship until we were safely at home and the storm had cleared. Nothing was then to be seen of her, and the natural conclusion was, that she had rounded the Culvers and was safe in Portsmouth Harbour but the next morning the horrible news came, which seemed too dreadful to be true, but on looking through the glass the masts and sails of the vessel were plainly visible, the tide having partially raised her.

Of course everyone is well acquainted with all the exertions that have been made to move her, and the various mishaps that have occurred from bad weather, &c., which prevented her from being transported to where she now lies, until quite lately. She was, on the night of the 28th of July, lying three-quarters of a mile from shore, and just facing Redcliffe. It was very dark, there being no moon, but clear, a breeze springing up, and the stars were bright. I, being passionately fond of canoeing, persuaded my husband and a friend that it would be delightful to paddle round the Eurydice in the evening, and, like most ladies, having eventually got my own way in spite of remonstrances, we set out, having the usual difficulty in supplying my *sposo* with a canoe to fit his portly form. After nearly an hour's easy work, we reached the wreck with only one slight mischance my friend having nearly tipped over one of the numerous hawsers, which, combined with pieces of wreck floating about, made the excursion a dangerous one, as it was too dark to see any small thing on the water and the small waves threw such shadows, that I repeatedly fancied I saw some poor dead face glaring up at me as I passed.

The ship lay completely out of water and presented a most sad and solemn appearance the broken deck, the ropes and chains, &c., hanging about, all looked so huge and grim and black standing out against the sky, with only one small ray of light from the lamp belonging to the man left in charge shining down into that dreadful grave where the corpses of over 200 brave men had found a last resting-place, they were so mingled together that it was impossible for them to be taken out separately, or in any way to identify them.

There was no sound save the rippling of the water, and occasionally the bells on board the tugs about 200 yards off. The water was more luminous than I had ever before seen it, and the phosphoric light came from the canoes and paddles in flashes and lines of fire, which greatly added to the curious weird beauty of the scene.

Having gone round, we returned home, paddling against a very strong tide. The lights of Sandown shining across the water, though a pretty sight, were very confusing, and I very nearly ended the evening and myself as well by all but charging a steam tug, which I did not see till close upon it, and my husband calling out, "Paddle left!" instead of right-- a rather awkward mistake. However, I am thankful to say we reached home, hungry and tired, at eleven o'clock. If anyone wishes to see the Eurydice in her beauty they should go at night, as, in the day the noise and confusion, and the numerous tourists talking and laughing and eating and drinking close to her, jars on the feelings somewhat, and the ship herself looks different when left alone and solitary on the sea. I believe they are going to, or have, moved her again, as she is breaking fast but as we left Sandown two days after our adventure I can add nothing more of my own Knowledge.

The Eurydice.

It is now believed that the last body has been recovered from the ship, and Admiral Foley has officially reported the ship clear of corpses. A thorough investigation was made by Jenkins, the diver, before this opinion was come to. The body of Lieut. Black was discovered jammed against the ladder. The body of a seaman was found in the cells of the lower deck, but not in irons. Since the ship has been off St. Helen's only 15 bodies have been recovered, making the total number recovered since the wreck 121, of which six were found in the sick bay. The number washed out to sea by the strong tide in the direction of France, must therefore have been more than was first supposed. A director of tbe Salvage Steamship Company has written a letter in reply to observations made in the House of Commons, and explained the difficulties of rasing sunken ships, and agreeing that the work done to the Eurydice by the dockyard authorities reflects great credit on them.

ROYAL VISIT TO THE EURYDICE.

The wreck of the ill-fated Eurydice, which lies within a cable's length of the fort on Bembridge Ledge, Isle of Wight, to which it was moved from Sandown Bay, was on Saturday evening visited by the King of Denmark, the Prince of Wales, and the two sons of the latter. Shortly after seven o'clock the Thunderer, with the party on board, steamed slowly round the eastern end of the Isle of Wight, and half an hour later she lay to within three-quarters of a mile of the wreck. The Thunderer had proceeded from Cowes to the westward and thence round the island, and she had been delayed in her arrival owing to the priming of her boilers. Admiral Fawnshawe's steam launch went alongside the Thunderer, and the King of Denmark, the Prince of Wales— the latter in the uniform of a captain of the Naval Artillery Reserve — and the two sailor princes in their naval cadets' uniform, embarked. On reaching the wreck, Admiral Foley introduced to the Royal visitors the cheif officials engaged in the raising of the wreck. The  Rotal visitors passed to the upper deck of the wreck, and, climbing to the top of the port side, stood upon some of the 80 tons of iron ballast which is to be used in canting the vessel, Mr. Robinson explaining the method to be adopted in performing the operation, which is fixed for to-morrow (Tuesday ) . A brief visit was paid to the main deck, and on returning the diagrams explanatory of tiie Work about to be performed were shown. A number of questions were put by the King od Denmark and the Prince of Wales in reference to the calamity. The Prince congratulated Admiral Foley and the officers acting with him upon the successful issue, so far, of the operations, and the King of Demark expessed his admiration of the indomitable energy and perserverance which had been exhibited by all concerned. THe Royal party returned in the steam launch of Admral Fanshawe to the Thunderer, which at once steamed to Cowes.

Why Was The Eurydice Not Raised Sooner?

Lord C. Heresford has made a long statement to show why the wreck of the Eurydice was not raised sooner. His lordship shews that there have been seventeen failures to lift the wreck ; and why ? The answer is that the weather was the sole cause. In answer to the suggestion that a private firm shoild have been employed to raise the ship, his lordship says:— "Now as to the point as to whether a private firm could have raised the wreck, which was generally preached as a better and a quicker expedient, the wreck was within 11 miles of the largest and best found dockyard in the world, the Admiralty had at their command not only the Admiral and all his most experienced officials and heads of departments, but everything that could possibly be wanted, both in skill and appliances. The total value of the plant that was use, and without which the Eurydice would be now where she foundered, he made out to be £150.000. There were six tugs, a steam lighter, four lighters, two corvettes, four coal hulks, and 230 men, all under discipline, consisting of fitters, shipwrights, riggers, seamen, engineers, and divers, all working under their different heads of departmeuts under the Admiral. What private firm or six private firms could have placed such a plant on the spot?

Referring to the cause of the disaster, Lord Heresford remarks :— "One word about the loss of the unfortunate ship. It was generally believed that it was caused by want of seamanship. He ventured to say it would have occurred to any man under the circumstances. Captain Hare, poor fellow, was one of the best seamen England had. He was specially picked for his duties on that account ; all the officers were also picked As the ship was under the lee of the land the squall was never seen, else the usual precautions would have been taken, such as letting go sheets and halliards. She was hove at once upon her beam ends, and the men could not get up from the lee scuppers to let go the necessary ropes. A good deal had been said about the lee ports being open and too much sail on the ship. The lee ports were always left open in a smooth sea. It was the weather ports that were closed, as the wash and spray all came from the windward side. Any officer would have cracked on also under the circumstances with a smooth sea and a falling glass, and his port close by. Captain Hare wanted to drop his anchor before the gale came on and before night set in,—instead of beating about all night in such a dangerous locality. He had his own idea as to why the sail was not shortened before. The deck clock was stopped at one minute to four. The ships company were piped to supper at seven bells. They never in the Navy turned the men up in their meal hours. He himself as officer of the watch had lost spars and sails by holding out a few minutes because the men had not finished their time. The men were at supper as would be seen by their mess traps and the tea leaves in the basins, and all the bodies were in their right rig. Captain Hare meant, he believed, to turn the hands up, and shorten sail at four o'clock. The few minutes lost the ship in his opinion. The squall, an awfully heavy one, struck her, and she took a tremendous lot of water over her lee gunwale. It hove her under water. She was going at a great pace, and he believed she sailed to the bottom ; she certainly was moving at a great pace when she struck the bottom, as her false keel was astern of herself on the bottom. He himself saw the bits and belaying pins, and not one single rope was let go. He could assure the hon. member for Penryn that his observations would cause far more pain to the old messmates and shipmates of Captain Hare than he would ever know. He was a splendid seaman, and most considerate to his men, and it was, in a roundabout way, his kindness to them that really prevented him turning the hands up before their time, and so the ship foundered before he could do anything.

The Operations at the Wreck of the Eurydice

The operations for heeling the wreck were resumed on Tuesday, and attended with considerable success. The lift was made during the morning, and, aided by the ballast placed on the port side, the wreck was got into an upright position. In the course of moving the vessel, 12 more bodies came to the surface, and were conveyed to Haslar Hospital. The repairs to the starboard side of the wreck will now be proceeded with, and at the conclusion of the work auother attempt will be made to pump her out. We hear, however, that the recent storms have greatly damaged the wreck.

The Eurydice.

Mr. Jabiz Hughes has obtained some really remarkable views of the wrecked Eurydice as she lies of St. Helen's. The great defect in all the photos hitherto obtained is that they are taken from so great a distance that the wrecked ship bears but an insignificant part in the general view. Mr. Hughes appears to have taken his picture instantaneously from some boat close to the wreck, the position of the ship being accurately shown, as well as the men on her deck searching for the bodies, &c. The photographs are printed by the permanent process.

The Eurydice.

—On Saturday the Prince of Wales and the King of Denmark visited the wreck of the Eurydice in one of the Royal yachts from Osbrorne. The Port-Admiral and other officials received the party, who made an exploration of the ship, and manifested the greatest interest in the explanations of the arrangements for floating the wreck, and bringing it into harbour. The Eurydice was successfully moved on Tuesday. To get at the leaks on starboard side was necessary to heel her over to port, and to assist in this operation, eighty tons of ballast were placed on a platform built on the port side of the wreck. The starboard side of the hull has sustained a good deal of damage through resting on the fluke of an anchor. In moving the vessel twelve more bodies came to the surface and were brought ashore for burial.

The Eurydice Court Martial.

—The court-martial, which, by the rules of the Service, it was necessary to hold on the two survivors of H.M.S. Eurydice, was opened Tuesday before Admiral Fanshawe, on board the Duke of Wellington, flag ship. Both the survivors, Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher, stated that they were of opinion that everything had been done to secure the safety of the vessel. The masters of various craft which were off the Isle of Wight at the time of the occurrence were examined aud said that the squall came on very suddenly, and that although they saw it in time to shorten sail, they believed those on board the Eurydice, from the position of the vessel, had not good an opportunity of knowing it was coming. The inquiry was then adjourned until Wednesday, when several witnesses were examined to the peculiarities of the fatal snow gale of the 24th of March. The inquiry was again adjourned.

VISIT TO THE EURYDICE.

The Eurydice, laid up alongside the old hulk Laurel in Porchester Creek, a continuation of Portsmouth Harbour, continues to be the centre of attraction. The wreck, so recently recovered from the deep is, however, zealously guarded by a detachment of marines until the work of clearing out the wreck has been finished. Through the courtesy of Admiral Foley, however, the Central News correspondent was enabled to make as examination of the whole of the ship yesterday afternoon. The entire centre of the upper deck is washed away through the violence of the waves during the time the wreck lay in Sandown Bay. The planks placed crosswise form a means of communication from one part of the upper deck to the other. On going below a scene of confusion presented itself. Most of the gear has been removed from the main deck, and many of the cabin knocked away, but the deck is still littered with the broken spurs and rigging. It is upon the lower deck that the scene is most chaotic. The deck is littered with *debris* from end to end, and the whole covered with a muddy slime several inches deep. Officers chests, men's clothes, bags, beer barrels, bird cages, pickle bottles, surgical cases and instruments which have fallen from the adjacent dispensary, lie upon the deck a heterogeneous and confused mass. Locomotion between decks in consequence of the quantity of mud which has been washed in was extremely difficult. The mainmast, the lower part of which still remains in the ship, was hoisted up out of the vessel, a distance of nearly six feet, by the bumping action to to which the vessel was subjected. The starboard side of the lower deck has also been considerably lifted out owing to the action of the sea. Right aft on the lower deck is situated the bread room, from which a most intolerable stench proceeded from the decomposed bread and other provisions, notwithstanding the fact that the Weeks are continually washed with carbolic acid. The captain's cabin has been entirely removed. On the lower deck are several cells, in one of which a prisoner was found, *minus* his head. The poor fellow was not chained, but another one, at large on the lower deck, was. The irons have been found near the mainmast, but no body. The holds are at present impossible to get down into owing to the fact that all the movable gear near the spot has rolled into them and choked them up. In making room for the suction pipes to go down between the lumber into the hold, the divers came across a body jammed in, and supposed to be that of the breadroom boy. Several articles of uniform clothing were scattered about the lower deck, amongst which is a lieutenant's undress uniform coat. Yesterday the working party came across a skull, but no more bodies. In case the vessel should meet with any untoward accident, anchors have been laid out from her, so that, in case the necessity should arise, she can be immediately hauled up on to the mud. One of the steam engines, got to work periodically, continues to be sufficient to keep the water under. As soon as poesible the work of clearing the ship — a labour of considerable magnitude—will be concluded, and the vessel fumigated and brought into port; but this is not likely to take place for at least a fortnight.

THE EURYDICE FLOATED AND TOWED INTO PORTSMOUTH.

The Eurydice has at last been safely brought to the surface, the floating operations having been successfully accomplished on Sunday, and the vessel was towed into Portsmouth exactly twenty-three weeks after her homeward voyage was brought to so abrupt and sad a termination. The beach was always well thronged with promenaders on Sunday, and the usual morning attendance had just been augmented by hundreds of persons coming from church. Consequently, the Beach and Piers were soon lined with spectators who evinced the utmost curiosity and interest in the proceedings. As the ships approached the harbour the "Pilot Jack" was run up at the Semaphore Tower in the dockyard. This flag is always exhibited when a ship of the navy is either entering or leaving harbour, so that the Eurydice, notwithstanding her battered and dismantled condition, is still regarded as a ship in commission, although but two of her crew remain to be paid off. As the ships passed the various vessels in the harbour the decks were lined with officers and men, many of whom had lost both relatives and friends in the foundering of the ship which had now been recovered from the deep. Amongst the spectators on board the flagship, Duke of Wellington, were Cuddiford and Fletcher, the two survivors, who are waiting the result of the court-martial, the decision of which will be read to-morrow. The vessels continued to the extreme end of the harbour, beyond the north corner of the dockyard, and the Eurydice was then safely berthed alongside the Laurel hulk. The steam tugs then withdrew, a party being left on board to take charge, together with two of Merryweather's powerful steam engines. which were to be used in continuing the work of pumping. Only one, however, was needed to keep the water under, for it was found that the Eurydice only leaked to the extent of three inches in half an hour. The hull of the Eurydice presents a sadly different appearance from what she did on the day she flundered. The smart white hull, chequered with the black ports, has all disappeared, and in their place is a hull denuded of nearly all its paint, scratched and splintered in all directions, whilst numerous planks nailed on to the sides for the purpose of repairing several of the leaks are not calculated to add to her smartness. One more body was discovered on the lower deck, making altogether 130 recovered from the wreck. The entire centre of the upper deck is washed away through the violence of the waves during the tinm the wreck lay in Sandown Bay. The planks placed crosswise form a means of communication from one part of the upper deck to the other. On going below a scene of chaotic confusion presented itself. Most of the gear has been removed from the main deck, and many of the cabins knocked away; but the deck is still littered with the broken spars and rigging. It is upon the lower deck that the scene is most chaotic; the deck is littered with *debris* fromn end to end, and the whole is covered with a muddy slime several inches deep. Officers' chests, men's clothes, bags, beer barrels, bird cages, pickle bottles, surgical cases and instruments lie upon the deck in a heterogeneous mass. Locomotion between decks, in consequence of the quantity of mud which has been washed in, was extremely difficult. On the lower deck is situated the bread room, from which a most intolerable stench proceeded from the decomposed bread and other provisions, notwithstanding the fact tht the decks are continually washed with carbolic acid. The captain's cabin has been entirely removed. On the lower deck are several cells, in one of which a prisoner was found minus his head. The poor fellow was not chained; but another one on the lower deck was. The irons have been found near the mainmast, but no body. The holds it is at present impossible to get down into, owing to the fact that all the moveable gear near the spot has rolled into them and choked them up. In making room for the suction pipes to go down the lumber into the hold the divers came across a body jammed in, and supposed to be that of the bread room boy. Several articles of uniform and clothing were scattered atout the lower deck, amongst which is a lieutenamt's undress uniform coat. The coart-martial assembled to inquire into the cause of the loss of the Eurydice delivered their finding on Monday. They were of opinion that the ship foundered in a sudden and exceptionally dense snowstorm on March 24, by pressure of wind on the sails, and that the upper half-ports being justifiably open, considering the state of the previous wind and weather, naturally conduced to the catastrophe. No one is to blame, the captain being frequently on deck, and carrying on duty before and at the time the squall struck her. The court is further of opinion that the stability of the ship was maintained after her adaptation as a training ship, and that after the alterations in May, 1877, she was in every respect an efficient ship. They fully acquit the two survivors, Cuddiford and Fletcher. A report as to whether the Eurydice is to be repaired has not yet been presented, but there is very little doubt that the wreck, as soon as it has been cleared, will be taken into dock and broken up. The hull is in a most dilapidated condition, and altogether so strained that it would probably cost more money to place the Eurydice in sea-going trim than the ship would be actually worth. The opinion that she will be broken up is strengthened by the fact that many vessels in far better condition which have been broken up.

THE EURYDICE TAKEN TO PORTSMOUTH.

About noon on Sunday persons on Ryde Pier and the Esplanade observed a small fleet of tugs under steam in the offing towards Sea View, and it was soon asserted that the Eurydice was being towed into Portsmouth Harbour, and a further scrutiny through telescopes continued the rumour, that at last the unfortunate ship was onde more fairly afloat, although it was difficult to believe that after the storms on Thursday night and Friday morning, the work of pumping out could have been effected. On Saturday the divers were busily engaged in making good the serious damage to the starboard and bilge, in default of doing which pumping out would have simply been impossible. From the commencement of their arduous task, the submarine workmen have shown a devotion to duty which has elicited the warm approval of the chief officers concerned. They worked with a persistent energy for hour after hour in repairing the bilge, from which, by contact with the bottom in the different lifts, three strokes of planking had been torn away for a distance of between forty and fifty feet, and nightfall had set in before they reported that the damage had been well migh made good. Canvas was stretched and fastened over the injured bilge, and covered with battens.

At five o'clock on Sunday morning the divers, seven in number, gave the finishing touches to their work, and, an hour later, Admiral Foley, Mr. J. Robinson, Chief Constructor at Portsmouth, Captain Batt, Mater Attendant at Chatham, Lieutenants Wonnam and Moss, and J. C. Froyne, the Second Constructor at Portsmouth, with others, were on the spot, and preparations were made fur pumping the wreck. Jenkins, a shipwright diver from Sheerness, in cutting a large scuttle hole into the lower deck, in order to carry down a suction pipe, discovered the body of a seaman in a store room, which was removed and taken into harbour for interment. At about seven o'clock the pumping was commenced, the Sampson and Grinder Government tugs setting to work with their steam pumps on the port, and the Manly and Malta — also Govenment tugs — on the starboard side. The pumping was continued for about four hours, and as the water in her was gradually lessened it was seen the divers had effectually stopped the serious leak on the starboard bilge, and that there was every probability that the wreck would be got into harbour. About half-past eleven the hull began to move, and the officers and men on the different craft gave three hearty cheers, while just afterwards an ensign was once more hoisted on board the Eurydice. Admiral Foley and other officials, with Mr. J. S. Harding, senior Admiralty pilot and Assistant Queen's Harbourmaster at Portsmouth, who piloted her into harbour, went on board, and shortly before noon she was on her way to Portsmouth harbour, a distance of about six miles. First came the Camel tug, towing five divers' boats, followed by the Grinder, which had the mastless wreck in tow, the latter having the Sampson and Manly lashed to her port side, and the Malta to her starboard. As the flotilla slowly approached Portsmouth some thousands of spectators flocked to the piers, beach, and lined the ramparts. The slow progress arose from the tide being against the craft until the spit was reached, after which they came into harbour on the flood tide, the help thus obtained enabling the tugs to proceed under easy steam. The weather was fine, with light wind and cloudy sky. By two o'clock the Eurydice had been safely secured alongside the Laurel, in Porchester Lake, and the Swan, with two steam fire engines, was placed alongside her, to resume pumping should it be found necessary. During the afternoon the waterman reaped a harvest, and the vicinity of the wreck was thickly thronged with boats crowded with people anxious to get a sight of the wreck, which presented a very dilapidated appearance. The battered weather-beaten hull was all that the public were allowed to see on Sunday. Thu work of clearing the lower deck and of fumigating will probably be commenced prior to the wreck being placed in dock.

The Eurydice has at length been raised and safely towed into Portchester Creek. How anxiously have the public, watched the proceedings of floating and pumping out of what six months ago was a stately vessel in full sailing trim, but now a battered hull. A good sized volume has been written and published about the disaster of March 24th, 1878, but how many volumes would it require to recount the heart-anguish caused by the upsetting of a single ship? How many homes have been desolated by the loss of loved ones just entering upon the active duties of life! How much must for ever remain unwritten on the exact fate of the bodies of the hundreds who perished on that fatal Sunday afternoon. Although the good ship foundered so near to land, not more than a moiety of the bodies have been recovered, and many of these were past all identification. There must be many nameless if not tombless graves, and who shall calculate the amount of suspense and eager expectation of the many fathers, mothers, and other relatives throughout the past, to them, dreary five months, as now and again bodies were washed ashore or picked up from the wreck. Not that there could possibly be any hope of any being restored to life; but the hope that at least there would be the melancholy satisfaction of knowing where the bodies of the loved ones were. Had the Eurydice gone down far out at sea there would have been at least some certainty that the forms of the lost ones could never again be seen by their sorrowing friends ; but within a few cable lengths of the shore the case was different. Again, how few have realised, to any appreciable extent, the fact that the workers at the wreck have had to carry on their labours in the presence, it might be, of some hundreds of corpses. Doubtless thousands have visited the vicinity of the wreck, and many expressions of sympathy have found place in the remarks of the spectators; but how many of the vast number who have heard of, read of or witnessed the catastrophe have been able to estimate the unpleasantness of the work of raising a ship in the hull of which might be entombed hundreds of human beings. It is well perhaps, that people cannot, even in imagination. enter minutely into the details of such things, and it is a merciful arrangement of Providence that a veil is drawn over many of the more painful incidents in connection with such calamities. There is at least one redeeming and consolatory feature in connection with the loss of the Eurydice, in the fact that there has been a general acquittal of blame on the part of the Captain or any one engaged in sailing the ship. The Court-Martial was concluded on Saturday; on Cuddiford, one of the survivors, being asked if be wished to add anything to the evidence he had given, replied in the following noble testimony to the ability and worth of the lamented Captain of the Eurydice :— "I should like to be allowed to say before this court-martial is concluded how much we all loved and respected our noble captain. We had unbounded confidence in him, knowing that as a sailor he was surpassed by none, and I am sure he had the love and respect of every officer and man in the ship, for he studied their comfort and happiness in all respects. We were proud of our captain, we were proud of our officers, and proud of our ship, looking upon her us admirably adapted for the service in which she was employed." The other survivor, Sydney Fletcher, entirely confirmed this testimony.

THE EURYDICE IN PORT.

The hull of the Eurydice formally passed into the hands of the Commander-in-Chief on Monday, and steps were at once taken to clean and sweeten her by means of carbolic acid and other disinfectants. Lieut. Izat and a party from the Duke of Wellington are engaged in clearing out the vessel, private baggage being removed before the stores of the ship, and two dockyard divers, Hicks and Macculloch, are told off to attend the ship night and day in case their services may be wanted at any time, but as the percolation of water in to the hold does not exceed one foot per hour, one of the Merryweather fire-engines suffices to pump out three hours' leakage in half an hour. As the ship becomes embedded in the harbour mud at every fall of the tide, the seams of the hull are closing up and the leakage is becoming gradually less. On Tuesday the skeleton of the gunner was found in his cabin, and removed to Haslar Hospital for interment. When the ship has been thoroughly cleaned she will be taken into the deep dock and broken up.

THE LAST OF THE EURYDICE.

The last of the Eurydice was seen yesterday, when the old timbers of the ship were sold at Portsmouth Dockyard by public auction. An order from the Admiralty prohibited the remnants of the ship being sold as relicts of the Eurydice, so the lots were simply sold as old timber. The prices were about the ordinary, as the interest in the wreck has by this time altogether subsided.

THE EURYDICE.

The unexpected delay which has occurred connection with the raising of the has, it is stated, evoked strong expression of dissatisfaction from the Admiralty, and it has been deemed advisable to call in aid the advice and assistance of the constructors' department Portsmouth dockyard. The divers went out to the scene the wreck of the Eurydice yesterday morning, and from the activity shown the Government officials it was thought that the vessel would be moved. About eleven o'clock, however, strong breeze set from the north-west, and the divers came ashore about noon, without attempting descend to the wreck.

A handsome tablet has been placed in the chapel of the dockyard at Portsmouth by permissian of the Admiralty, aud is a fine specimen of the sculptor's art. On a tablet of jet black marble is a cross, anchor, and cable resting on a rock covered with seaweed, and beneath a scroll in white block marble, the latter bearing the following inscription, surmounted by the word "Eurydice," and having underneath the crest and motto of the deceased: "In affectionate rememberance of Francis Hope Tabor, Lieutenant Royal Navy, who was drowned by the capsizing of H.M S. Eurydice off Donnose, Isle of Wight, March 24th, 1878. This tablet was erected by the officers of the ships in which he had served."

The Diving at the Wreck of the Eurydice.

With reference to the amount paid to the divers in connection with the raising of the Eurydice, Messrs. Siebe and Gorman, submarine engineers to the Royal Navy, write that they had four men engaged at the wreck, and not three, as stated, and that it was only their foreman diver who received £1 5s. per tide. During the four months that operations were carried on the men were working day and night, and the pay they received was in the aggregate the same as that of the dockyard divers.

THE NAVY ESTIMATES.

LATEST TELEGRAMS London, Thursday. The navy estimates for the coming financial year were issued this morning, and show a decrease compared with last year of £93,959. The principal item in saving is in the vote for machinery end ships built by contract, in there is a decrease of £73,000. For the conveyance of troops £38,000 less than last year will be required. For wages, victuals, and pensions a slightly increased vote is required. Under the head of purchase for torpedoes the amount required is nil. Last year's estimates included a sum of £10,000 on this account. Under the scientific branch is a new item of £9,811 for the training of naval cadets. There is a decrease of over £11,000 in the dockyards and naval yards. A sum of £500 is set apart under the heading of miscellaneous services for the Eurydice memorial.

H.M.S. Atalanta.

Two hundred pinds offered by the Admiralty as a reward for any one giving definite information as to the cause or the locality of the loss of the missing training ship will be regarded by the relatives and friends of the poor fellows on hoard as an indication that there is no longer room for the slightest doubt as to the dreadful nature of the catastrophe. Even the official mind, which is slow to admit the occurrence of events prejudicial to itself, by the issue of this notice reluctantly places upon record the fact that the last gleam of hope for the safety of the ship and her precious cargo of human lives has vanished. It is now a melancholy certainty that the ship which was sent to sea by the Admiralty in the place of the Eurydice has met with a precisely similar fate — that she has been blown over and swalowed up by the pitiless waves, and that at one fell swoop has the desolation of death been carried to over three hundred homes. The country from end to end is thrilled with horror by this terrible calamity, and already the demand has gone forth that the Admiralty itself shall be placed upon its trial in order to the prevention of the recurrence of such woful mishaps. Although the reward of £250 has been offered, we much doubt whether we shall ever obtain reliable information as to the exact spot, or the time, or the method of the foundering. There is no doubt but that she went down carrying with her every trace of the accident, and whatever wreckage may be thrown up hereafter will have travelled so far in deep sea currents as to be valueless save as mementoes of the dead, The disaster is so awfully dreadful that it is impossible as yet to think or to write of it with calmness.

THE ATALANTA.

*The Brighton Gazette* of Thursday is responsible for a somewhat extraordinary statement concerning the missing training-ship Atalanta. It says : "We have special information from an authentic source that so long ago as the 4th of May a sailor of the mercantile marine, whose name is known, and who has been sometime in Newhaven and Brighton, communicated direct to the Admiralty full particulars, or at least the means of obtaining full particulars, and giving the reason why he was unable or afraid to come forward in the matter himself. This communication seems to have been ignored, and on the 12th or 13th he wrote again, saying he knew what certain parties were making out of the retention of the facts, and that he thought it wrong they should be longer withheld. This was again ignored, but the next day or so the Admiralty sent a letter for insertion in the daily papers, saying that they thought all hope of the Atalanta must now be abandoned!" The journal suggests that the offer of a reward was probably made with the view of inducing the man to come forward, but the same influence which prevented his coming forward in the first instance will probably have the same effect now. The *Gazette* concludes with a significant remark. It says : "When we add the fact, which is beyond all doubt — that during the present week certain not obscure persons, both in Brighton and London, have had in their hands a chart 'lined ' and marked with minute details of the Atalanta, at a date since any official or other information can be obtained of her, or is ever likely to be, we think we are justified in saying a very great mystery surrounds the whole matter, and that our information is special and extraordinary."

Mr. Edward H. Capper, of Cardiff, in discussing the loss of the Atalanta, calls attention to the suggestion frequently made that she may have capsized like the Eurydice. He points out that the Eurydice did not capsize, but foundered because when lying over heavily under a press of canvas she filled through her lee ports, which were open. He adds that he was never in any ship which would not have done the same.

The Secretary of the Royal Naval School, New Cross, writes : " I have the pleasure to acquaint you that at a meeting of the Council of the Royal Naval School, held at New Cross, on Tuesday, I was directed at once to ascertain the number of children of officers of ward-room rank left fatherless by this sad calamity, with a view to receiving their sons into this school on such terms as the circumstances in each case may render necessary."

In the history of lost vessels probably the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty never took so much trouble to obtain intelligence as in the case of the missing Atalanta. In prosecuting enquiries, letters have been addressed to the following maritime nations, requesting that captains of vessels should be instructed to keep a look-out for ahy trace of the missing ship: France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austro-Hungary, Greece, Chili, and the United States of America. The foregoing Powers are those who have recently combined with England in a new and important system of international ocean signalling. The ready acquiescence manifested by all the maritime governments of the earth makes it evident that there is a world-wide sympathy with England, and an anxiety to aid in ascertaining the fate of those 300 youths whose disappearance is at present involved in mystery. At tbe present time there must be some thousands of vessels on the watch.

HER MAJESTY'S SHIP " EURYDICE."

n the pretty cemetery of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, on Wednesday afternoon, Lady Isabel Atherley veiled a fine monument, which has been erected there by public subscription, to the officers and men who perished by the foundering of the *Eurydice* off Shanklin, in March, 1878. Seven of the bodies were buried in this cemetery, among them, as many suppose, the body of Captain Hare, the commander. The monument has been erected from a design furnished by Mr. F. J. Moynihan, of Uxbridge-road. Many persons were present to witness the ceremony, after which Lieutenant Langley, on behalf the Naval Service, thanked the people of Shanklin for erecting so worthy a memorial to the gallant men who had perished amid such lamentable circumstances.

UNVEILING OF THE "EURYDICE" MEMORIAL AT SHANICLIN.

The pretty cemetery given to the pariah of Shanklin by Colonel Atherley was on Wednesday the 23rd ult., the scene of an interesting and deeply-impressive ceremony—the unveiling of a monument erected there to the memory of the Crew of the "Eurydice," which, with its precious freitage of some 300 young sailors, was suddenly whelmed beneath the waves in the awful gale of that fatal Sunday afternoon a little more than two years ago. The bodies of seven of the crew, washed up from the wreck are buried in Shanklin cemetery; the place, moreover, is within sight of the spot where the ship went down ; and it was fitting, therefore, that here should be raised an appropriate and enduring memorial to the brave officers and crew of the hapless vessel. Bright weather favoured the unveiling ceremony, which took place in the presence of a large gathering of persons, amongst whom were naval and coastguard officers and a number of bluejackets, representing, we were told, all Her Majesty's ships now in Portsmouth Harbour. Soon after half, past three a procession was formed at the cemetery lodge, a number of coastguardmen walking at the head, and following them were the surpliced choir and clergy of St. Saviour's-on-the Cliff, Col. and the Lady Isabel Atherley and friends, and the members of the Shanklin Burial Board. The procession first went to the Gate Chapel, one of the clergy saying the sentences from the Burial Office, and in the Chapel, the anthem "man that is born of a woman" was sung. The procession then moved towards the graves, the choir chanting the 29th and part of the 17th Psalms, at the close of which—the company present having formed into a circle round the graves—the beautiful and appropriate hymn, "Fierce raged the tempest o'er the deep, from " Hymns Ancient and Modern," was sung with marked feeling. Following this was an address very impressive and appropriate by the Rev. C. I. Borland, vicar of St. Saviour's, who said he believed that there was in seamen a strong instinctive feeling that whereever their bodies might be cast they had a yearning desire that those bodies should be committed to the dust, if possible with pious words, and with loving friends standing round. It was for this reason, he had been told, that it was very often the custom with them to mark their bodies, so that they might be identified when they were found. It was to them a melancholy satisfaction that they could rear this stone over the bodies of the brave. We did not know their names, but we knew that they belonged to a service which we highly honoured. It might seem strange to some that ministers of religion should speak with admiration of those whose duty it was to carry arms in the service of their country ; but he had no hesitation in feeling and expressing that admiration. No Christian man could read his Bible without feeling that war may sometimes be a very necessary evil, and it was often the case that war called forth some of the bravest and noblest qualities that were to be found in man. For himself he had no fear that Englishmen would ever be found wanting in the truest type of bravery, or that they would ever do discredit to the flag that had waved so long. He had the comforting conviction that our sailors and our soldiers were becoming brave with a higher bravery than the mere courage that would face the enemy. He believed more and more that there were in the army and the navy men who were imbued with simple piety, and who were not afraid to acknowledge Him, their Saviour, who, though the gentlest and the most loving, was ever the bravest of the brave, the noblest of the noble. Many were there who made it their pride to serve Him and to do His will. It had been told him that some had supposed that amongst the bodies buried here was that of the captain of the ill-fated Eurydice. If so, then here had they an illustration of what a sailor might be—brave and noble in the highest sense of those words, for he was brave and noble in the service of his Saviour. And they also knew that there were some precious relics left of that crew. There were not many, but they knew that in a little Sussex cottage there was a letter read with tearful eyes, and that letter indicated that amongst the young on board the vessel there was just that tone which all must have wished should be the case when they heard of that terrible catastrophe. "We have come here this afternoon," concluded the rev. speaker, " to unveil this memorial, and to show that we honour the profession to which these men belonged, and that we have a lively sympathy with our sailors in the perils and dangers which they are called upon to endure. We have come also to show that we feel a deep interest in all that concerns them, and that our inmost hearts are touched when our brave ones are suddenly called away. They are dear to us, though no stone may tell their names, their worth, their glory ; but a record of their lives in hearts that love them well. These men, as much as those who fall in battle, fell in the path of duty and is the service of their country, and they belong to that noble band of heroes whose names and deeds grace our British story."

A prayer of dedication of the monument was then read by the Rev. F- Hummell, curate of St. Saviour's, as follows :

O Lord. at whose word the stormy wind ariseth, behold with Thy favour our memorial of these sailors, who sank with their ship almost in sight of home ; and mercifully grant that all who in pity shall read its record, may be led to ponder the uncertainty of this mortal life, and be stirred up to secure that life everlasting, which Thou has given us in our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.

Other appropriate prayers followed, and the Lady Isabel Atherley then unveiled the memorial by removing the Union Jack which had hitherto shrouded it from view.

The monument is of Portland stone, eight feet high, and the rockwork base is six feet by four feet. The base is surmounted by a naval trophy, consisting of crossed anchors and a cannon, with a snapped cable, a broken chain-link, and other fitting emblems, a Union Jack supplying the drapery. The cannon points to the spot where the Eurydice went down. On the front face of the monument is the inscription :

" To the memory of the officers and men of  
H.M.S. EURYDICE,  
which foundered off Shanklin,  
March 24, 1878,  
Seven of whom are buried here."

—and on the opposite side there is carved lettering as follows: 

" Erected by public subscription and unveiled by  
Lady Isabel Atherley,  
June 23rd, 1880."

—Immediately above this is a representation of the ribbon of a seaman's cap, with " H.M.S. Eurydice " upon it. The monument was designed by Mr. F. J. Moynihan, of London, assisted by Mr. A. Tyler, hon. sec. of the London committee, and the former gentleman executed the sculpture, which is strikingly effective and appropriate.

Col. Atherley, sfter the ceremony of unveiling was performed, addressed a few remarks to the company. He might say for Lady Isabel that she had experienced a feeling of satisfaction in being priviledged to take part in the tribute which had been paid that day to those brave men to whose memory that beautiful monument had been reared, and this satisfaction both as regarded his lady and himself was strengthened by the thought that there was about that place something which told of the kind and friendly feeling which existed between them and the inhabitants of Shanklin and its neighbourhood. He was sure he might say for Lady Isabel that she was always glad to be permitted to join those amongst whom she lived in doing any good and kindly work. The Colonel then referred in touching words to the calamity which occurred two years since in front of the windows of those who lived at Shanklin, and he added that the sorrow and the sympathy which were then called forth still lived—sorrow for those so suddenly and prematurely cut off, and sympathy for the bereaved relatives who had to mourn the loss of near and dear ones. Amongst the harrowing scenes which took place at the time was the casting up of the seven bodies which had found a resting-place in that Cemetery. Save in one instance, those bodies were unknown—unrecognised. After the interment a committee was formed for the purpose of erecting a suitable memorial ; but as the names of the bodies recovered were, with one exception, unknown, it was thought that the monument should be erected not to any particular persons, but to the memory of all the officers and crew, and to commemorate what was indeed a national calamity. To carry out this work a committee was formed in Shanklin, consisting of Messrs. Amon, F. Rayner, H. Sanders, R. T. Blew. Paybody, Tizard, Cantlow, and Humby, with himself as chairman, and under the able secretaryship of Mr. A. Tyler, a committee was formed in London, the members of which were Messrs. Robert Hewett (chairman), H. B. Clarke, W. Foster and J. Aldridge (of Leigh, Essex) C. J. James, and F. Meek. Mr. Tyler was instrumental in obtaining from the talented sculptor, Mr. Monyihan, a model of the memorial which had been just uncovered, and he thought they would all agree with him that in design and execution the work had been admirably carried out, and that the monument was in keeping with the event which it was intended to commemorate- After remarking that the Burial Board had in this instance waived their claim to the usual fees, the gallant colonel concluded by stating that, in the name of Lady Isabel, he declared the memorial unveiled. Might that monument stand there for many years, keeping fresh the memory of the brave crew of the Eurydice, and telling all who had to face the perils of the great waters that there were warm hearts on shore who deeply sympathised with them in the dangers which they were at times called upon to encounter. He was glad to see so many sailors present on that occasion. Amongst them were two naval officers, Lieut. Langley, of H.M.S. Excellent, and Lieut. Whiddon, of H.M.S. Crocodile, and he would ask one of then to say a few words.

Lieutenant Langley, R.N., stepped forward and said: Colonel and Lady Isabel Atherlev, on the part of the service to which I have the honour to belong I desire to thank you and all the subscribers for the beautiful monument which has been erected above the bodies of our poor comrades who died in the service of their country. Your kind act of this day will never be forgotten by the British Navy.

On the proposition of Mr. Nicholson, J.P., D.L. of Ventnor, an expression of thanks was conveyed' to the Lady Isabel Atherley for the part which she had so kindly and gracefully performed ; and Col. Atherley, after acknowledging the compliment, said they were greatly indebted to the clergy and choir of St. Saviour's for the impressive service which they had rendered, and which had invested the ceremony with an interest and solemnity that would not soon be forgotten.— After a few words in reply by the Rev. C. I. Burland, who spoke in high terms of his choir, the hymn " Eternal Father, strong to save," was sung, and the proceedings closed with the Benediction, pronounced by the Vicar of St. Saviour's.

THE EURYDICE MONUMENT AT SHANKLIN

This monument, which has been erected by public subscriptions, to the memory of the officers and men of H.M.S. Eurydice stands in the cemetery at Shanklin, where lie the seven bodies which were recovered from the wreck, including, as is believed, that of Captain Hare, the commander of the ill-fated vessel.

It is composed of granite and Portland stone, the base meable (which has been prepared by the convicts at Chatham Prison), and the next tier is of worked Portland stone, bearing the names of the deceased. The capstone is also of "Portland," carved to imitate rockwork and irosweed, and it is to be surmounted by the actual cable and anchor of the ill-fated brig. It is to be a very handsome structure, 17 feet across at the base. Two pieces of the carved rockwork were in the Portland railway station yard this week.

"EURYDICE " MEMORIAL.

A very handsome C- memorial to the memory of those who foundered in re H.M.S. Eurydice has just been completed in Hasiar m Cemetery, over the spot where the bodies were buried, at and facing a similar monument erected to the memory of the officers and menwho were killed by the explosion d on board the Thunderer. The memorial is very attrsc- le tive, and somewhat novel in its design. The base is ao formed of about 12 inches of polished granite, is 2Ift. ;o by lift., and 10ft. high. It is four sided. Above the first portion of the base. the monument slopes upward and inward with a mouldingofPortlandstone. Above lo that rises the obelisk, which is intended to represent a .n rugged rock with the sea running over it in 'y parts. The action of the water has rubbed it smooth 2- in some parts, and in other places there is carving in imitation of sea weed. The top is surmounted by the Jeanchor of the Eurydice, in a position nautically known as " fouled." The granite is of a dull grey kind, and d has been prepared by convict labour at Chatham, and le the Portland stone has been similarly dressed by the ly same means. On one side are the names of the officers s0 in the centre of two rows of men's names. On one corner are the words " H.M.S. Eurydice," and on *hanother side "Foundered March 24th, 188." JTust above the moulding of the obelisk are the texts: ": My a God is the rock of my refuge," " I will bring my people le again from the depths of thesea," "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul," and "A And the sea gave up the e dead which were in it." Altogether the monument is loft. ein height. On one side are 75 names another 103; a er third 71; and the fourth 62. The design is that of ar General Pasley. The monument has been erected under in the direction of Mr. Carruthers, Assistant Civil Engi- 1 neer attached to the Gosport works, and the builders iewere, Messrs. Bramble Bros., Government contractors.

THE EURYDICE MEMORIAL AT HASLAR

It will be remembered that the bodies of the unfortunate officers and seamen which were recovered from the wreck of the *Eurydice* were laid to rest in Haslar Cemetery, near Gosport, each grave being marked with a simple headstone. A more imposing memorial, as represented in our engraving, has now been erected on the spot. It was designed by Colonel Parley, R.E., C.B., and erected by Mr. Carruthers, the Assistant Civil Engineer for Gosport, and Messrs. Bramble, the contractors for the work. The base, of bright granite, bears upon its sloping ledge the 316 names of those who went down with the ill-fated vessel on Sunday, March 24th, 1878, and above this is a moulding of Portland stone, each side of which contains an appropriate quotation from Scripture. This again is surmounted by a huge rocky superstructure, on the summit of which is the real anchor, shackle, and part of the ship's cable which was recovered from the scene of the disaster. The measurement at the base is 23 feet by 17 feet, and the height is 10 feet. Our engraving is from a photograph by G. West and Son, Gosport, copies of which have been purchased by Her Majesty the Queen.

LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

Mrs C. Mitchelmore. 33 Briton's-road, writes: I have a few remembrances in my mind which no doubt will be very interesting to others as well as myself. The one that comes first is the foundering of H.M.S. Eurydice off the Isle of Wight. I cannot state the exact date. It was about this time of the year in the eighties. 

*Image: Two of the survicors of the Eurydice whose prtraits were preserved by the writer of this note.*

It was on a Sunday afternoon, and, as usual, I was in Sunday School at Watts Hall, being in the second Bible class. We were told off to our Bible Classrooms: ours was in the tower facing :he parks. During Scripture lesson the darkness that came over seemed noticeable, it being a lovely bright afternoon. All at once the wind was very boisterous, blowing people in all directions. Then came a blizzard thick and fast. with no chance for anyone to take shelter.

On Monday morning the newspapers spoke of the foundering of a man-of-war, H.M.S. Eurydice, off the Isle of Wight, in a blizzard, at the same time we had it in Southampton. Only two men were saved. One died a few years after: the other. I believe, died in recent years.

Londoners as well as others were deeply distressed at this terrible calamity. Excursions were run from London at 2s. 6d. return on Sundays. I had to meet friends on the Royal Pier from London. Boats were there to take us on our way to the spot where the Eurydice was sunk. We took our seats in a rowing-boat like many others to cruise round. It was not far from land. Two vessels were there, one on each side of the wreck. All at once something must have given way as orders were given for all boats to clear out. I was glad in one sense, for our small craft was letting in water.

On landing I found a peice of the wreck, which I have now as a relic. A gentleman living in one of the houses facing the wreck was watching the Eurydice passing along when the blizzard came on. When it had passed over no boat was to be seen.

(The date of the wreck of the Eurydice was March 24th, 1878. Ed., "Hampshire Advertiser.")

HAVANT OF PAST DAYS

A Eurydice Memory

A vivid picture arises in my mind of a Sunday in March. 1878. It was one of those brilliant cloudless days, reminding one that winter is over. and giving a foretaste of summer days ahead. I was chorister of 12 then and was attending afternoon service at St. Faith's. Suddenly it grew dark, clouds blotted out the sun, the wind howled in fury round the building, and snow, sleet and hailstones dashed against the windows. Almost as suddenly at is began, the wind dropped, the clouds disappeared, and the sun shone out again. Probably the storm would have been forgotten, but for the catastrophe caused the same blizzard off the Isle of Wight. The Eurydice, a training vessel for young, sailors was caught on its way home Portsmouth after a long voyage. and capsized, every soul on board, except two, being drowned.

LOST IN SIGHT OF HOME

1878 There are few more mournful pages in the history of the British Navy than that which records the loss, on Sunday, March 24, 1878, of the last Eurydice, and, with her, of hundreds of brave fellows who had devoted themselves to their country's service. The Eurydice was a 26 gun ship, built at Portsmouth, after designs by Rear-Admiral Elliott, and launched with much ceremony and rejoicing on May 16. 1843. The following lines on the launch were published by the Hampshire Telegraph:

"In days long gone a pretty craft,  
All taut and ship-shape fore and aft,  
Skimmed lightly o'er the Thracian Sea,  
'Twas Orpheus' Eurydice.

But now a prettier craft behold,  
Her bunting to the wind unfold ;  
Let Orpheus' maid forgotten be,  
Lo Elliott's lair Eurydice.

Hail to thee! Modern beauty, hail !  
Success and honour with thee sail,  
Till as of old, both land and sea  
Ring with thy name, Eurydice."

Alas ! the day did come when land and sea rang with her name, and there was anguish and deep sorrow in the sound. On February 17, 1877, the vessel was commissioned at Portsmouth by Captain Marcus A. S. Hare, as a training ship for ordinary seamen, and when ready she proceeded on a cruise to the West Indies. On March 6 of the following year-1878—she left Bermuda for home, and had made a fine passage. when nearing Ventnor, with all sail set, about four o'clock on the 24th of that a storm of snow and wind came on with sudden and terrific force. Captain Hare who was on deck superintending as officer of the watch, gave orders to shorten sail. The lower studding sail had been taken in, and the watch were about to take in the upper sails when the vessel lurched heavily, and Captain Hare ordered the men to come from aloft. The vessel continued to heel over to the starboard side, and the water came over the lee bulwarks. The ship righted herself a few feet, but the apparent recovery of her balance was but momentary, for she almost immediately went down bodily, bow first. Whilst the few survivors of the wreck were struggling in the water they were sighted by the Emma, schooner, of Padstow, from Newcastle-on-Tyne to Poole. A boat was lowered, and five men were picked up, three of whom, however, afterwards expired, including Mr. Tabor, the First Lieutenant. Thus there were but two survivors- Sydney Fletcher and Benjamin Cuddiford— out of a crew of over 330. The unhappy ship was, after some months of labour, lifted from that muddy grave and brought to Portsmouth, where she was broken up.

From Sir Conan Doyle's powerful poem on this catastrophe we quote the stanzas :

Up with the royals that top the white spread of her!  
Press her and dress her, and drive through the foam;  
The Island's to port, and the mainland ahead of her,  
Hey for the Warner and Hayling and Home!

A grey swirl of snow with the squall at the back of it,  
Heeling her, reeling her, beating her down!  
A gleam of her bends in the thick of the wrack of it,  
A flutter of white in the eddies of brown.

It broke in one moment of blizzard and blindness;  
The next, like a foul bat, it flapped on its way.  
But our ship and our boys! Gracious Lord, in your kindness,  
Give help to the mothers who need it to-day!

Give help to the women who wait by the water,  
Who stand on the Hard with their eyes past the Wight.  
Ah! whisper it gently, you sister or daughter,  
"Our boys are all gathered at home for to-night."

In the rigging house at Portsmouth Dockyard the figure-head of the ship is still preserved, a woman whose features harrowing grief—for it represents the fallen Eurydice calling in vain for Orpheus. From the neck of the figure-head is a tarnished and battered telescope, which was found in that position when the divers first descended to the wreck.

A relief fund of £23,000 was raised for the dependents of the men who were lost.
