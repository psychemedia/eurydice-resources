The Eurydice, 26, building Portsmouth upon the plan laid down Admiral Elliot, will launched next month. She is constructed on the draught of the Vestal, with an increase of length and a decrease of beam, and the reduction of the angle of the floor, which will reduce her draught of water about 18 inches. This vessel is extremely clean abaft and forward, and there is no doubt she will have great velocity ; but, in all probability, she will prove very wet.

WEATHERLINESS OF THE EURYDICE.

To the Editor of the Hampshire Telegraph.

Sir, -I learn that the Eurydice draws two feet less water than is usual with ships of war of her size and tonnage. Now this fact, connected as it is with her superior capabilities on a winid, appears to me, to be as a relation of thinigs that deserves no slight consideration-one inideed that ought to be scrutinizingly looked into ; because the quiality of ships' weatherliness is taught by some ship designers to depend on the amiounit of their respective *lateral resistance*, or the quantity of immersed area of the greatest longitudinal sectton a vessel when on the wind offers to the floating medium. 



That thlis is fl very prevalent opinlion need Por: not be urged onl those wvho attend to changes made ini order to imuprove leewuardly vessels and those carrying C e b.lack helms'i for the alterationis theou effected in ttheu e are ievarliahiy in accordance wvith it, and found to con2s sist eithler in brhigrini them dowvn inl the water b~y 1V Y meesims ot' nioro ballast, givingf thletim additionial f~als'e S'i'(t keel, or gripeb or increaise of t'oretout. All these are, ISC b- owever, futile conitrivanices, said friom general failure *Vir ~. wshenever put hito practice, have proved themselves to ini . be but vatlueless substitutionis to couniteract thme ill good ',consequenices atteniding had constrmictions. The caser ot' thc Jlmnydfce, asaC contradictionl to the entire truth ot' this taught principle, in my opinionl, formis anlh i-- stance of'a very strikiiig kind, sinice we find in her tihe iipoisession ot' th~e quality ?? great wveatheiliness, (0o-0 'f loined with dimin~utipn. of later al resistance. The il ain g tact, as relates to her, beimig established to this extent, nine I thinkL thlen there arises a right to regard the posses. lie h - ?? ot'that desirable q~uality by her asaresnllt ofasnme- trusi e, thimig additional and disthict f'ron a requisite portion of pricc i, hitel'(il rcaivtolec, hich, of ou rsc,i; alwvays indisp~eois their ,able, though, perhlapls, cven I hat of'the Enrqicyde's is t'ar- f too great; auid a possibilitytnaythereto'oe exist that the 1' .quality ill question aiid so consp~icuous in hei, muight he J as taily possessed by vessels considerably flatter- tasci floored than hlerself. Tihat this developncleuit miight hias uoccr in forums ?? as described it is thought Tre'~c will appear evidenit, shouldl whlat is about to be slated fine - be conceived to expjlain the true cause of that shlip's ?? weatherly capacity.

A letter from Lieut. Sabben, R.N. on a subject of considerable interest to naval men — namely, the cause of " weatherliness" in ships, as illustrated by that apparent in H.M.S. Eurydice, was published by our local contemporary some little time since. It msy not be irregular, if we say a few words on the subject, without going into Lieut. Sabben's theory, which would be "dry" — and therefore unpardonable.

e doubt whether " giving additional false keel, or gripe, or increase of forefoot," be " futile contrivances," by way of making a ship more weatherly when deficient in that important quality ; — they will oot turn a bad ship into a good one, any more than s pair of spectacles will do the same for defective sight ; but that such things have something to do wilh " weatberiiness," universal experience seems to attest. We also doubt extremely the fact alluded to. concerning vessels which have the faculty of being lifted bodily to windward, and making " weather " way, instead of " leeway"; and, con- sequently, having to reckon the former instead of the latter in their calculations on a voyage. Tbat aome sailors M say " that some ships do this, proves little : we have heard it said that musket balls rise on leaving the barrel. The question of how accu- rately ships do "fetch tbe point they look up to," is very interesting in each individual case, and should be carefully tried, when, and where, no weather or lee, tide or current, lurks as a disturbing cause. Rut our concern is with Lieut. Sabben's data, the chief of which is the weatherliness of the Eurydice. 1 She has " little " (comparative) "lateral resist-] smce" ;— is that quite certain ? Does not length, I and great length of keel, give this ? and is not the Eurydice longer, considerably, " than ships of war of her size and tonnage" : ex. gr. Sir W. Symonds's 26s ? We do not presume to speak positively ; and are quite sure that Lieut. S. is well able to set us right, if we are not so ; but we should have guessed that the " lateral resistance " of Eurydice, waa at leaat equal to that 'of Vestal, for instance : a ship of tbe claas with which alone Eurydice is to be compared, with any fairness. Our own very clumsy notion is, that " very different, indeed opposite arrangements of the elements ofa ship's form," may produce almost equal excellence, in onr present state of knowledge of the subject be it remembered, and without saying tbat there is not one leading principle of form which may be perfect, supposing we could get at it. Now, ob- serve these trials of Eurydice and Warspite ; the formerly certainly had tbe advantage ; we never for a momcnl doubted that sbe would — at least, we always expected it. But there was a third vessel in company, dnring (we think) most of those trials— H.M. brig Grecian, built on a plan much more un- like both Warspite and Eurydice, than either of these was unlike tbe other, with the very form which Lient. S. thinks a mistaken one— namely, with ' great rise of floor" — in fact, a complete wedge ; and yet she went to windward of both ships. So that the facts are these— here were three ships, differing in model many ways, and especially as to their midship sections — one having a flat floor, tbat of an old two-decked ship ; tbe other having a sharper form, with a very deep " hollow," but still with con- siderabse fulness ; the third with what Captain Rous called a "peg-top midship section" ; and the result of tbe trials pieces tbe flattest-floored ship most to leeward ; the mezao-termine next ; and little peg- top spinning away to windward of all 1 Now we do not infer that therefore the flatter-floored a aliip is tbe lest weatberiy she is, and tbe sharper tbe more ao— tbere a hundred otber things to be thought of, and otber trials might give other result* ; but there are the facts. We are to remember that, as yet, Eurydice has had no trial with any ship of her own class, and with which she was built expressly to compete — namely, Sir W. Symonds's beautiful 265 ; but we may give it as an opinion — perhaps a worthless one — that hei model is superior to theirs. Again, we are all to recollect that there is another ship on tbe same plan as Eurydice, now of some standing and known character in the service — the corvette Modeste. This ship was for some time in company with the Rover, a corvette of precisely similar claas, but on the almost opposite plan of Sir W. Symonds. We never saw any official account of their trials, but we bad our's from the officer then commanding H.MS. Vestal, and under whose orders Rover and Modeste tben were; he had frequent opportunities of judging of these two representations of opposite systems, under a variety of circumstances. The result was that, taking one thing with another, they were very equal in excellence ; tbe superiority of Modeste, as to speed, was off tbe wind, or in smooth water ; tbat of Rover, invariably, was close-hauled, and especially wben blowing fresh. Tbat is, be it observed, just at the time wben the " mechanical action " of tbe ?? body " on the " floating medium," spoken of by Lieutenant Sabben, would come into operation. We only throw oot these facts for bis consideration, or that of any one whom they may i. tercet, without in any way meaning to dogmatise on them. All will agree with Lieut. S. that the closest attention should be paid to the position of tbe ** greatest breadth ;" for. as yet, opinions differ about it considerably. All will agree, likewise, that whatever tends to " thiow " tbe weather bow " up to windward," lias ' tbe same tendency as regards ?? the entire ship ;" it being proverbial tbat, " where tbe head is, tbe body will not be far behind," unless the ship should have tbe mishap to come in two, and its dissevered portions should start, each on its own account. Lieut. S. is of course aware that in the case of the " Symondian " ships (tbe sharpest, and we really think, taken as a wbole, the most weatherhj class of ships in existence) beiog " brought down " generally ruins them ; and the lighter tbey are tbe better. The reasons are obvious, on an examination of their form. All will concur in what be says as to the imporunce of Light draught : but on tbis we cannot now enter. With very much that Lieut. S. doubtlessly has to say, we suspect that we should agree ; and bis letter was an interesting one. What we protest against is, "ot his theory, but tbe assumption that it is proved or supported, by the recent trials of the Eurydice. Whether bis theory be correct is quite a separate question.

THE EURYDICE.

The unexpected delay which has occurred connection with the raising of the has, it is stated, evoked strong expression of dissatisfaction from the Admiralty, and it has been deemed advisable to call in aid the advice and assistance of the constructors' department Portsmouth dockyard. The divers went out to the scene the wreck of the Eurydice yesterday morning, and from the activity shown the Government officials it was thought that the vessel would be moved. About eleven o'clock, however, strong breeze set from the north-west, and the divers came ashore about noon, without attempting descend to the wreck.

THE EURYDICE. Five bodies (or rather portions) have been recovered during the week. One was a seaman named Taylor, and another Lieut. George Falconer, R.M.

The proper pronunciation of the name of the ill-fated ship is Eu-*ryd*-i-ce, making it sound as four syllables, accenting the second.

Operations at the wreck were resumed yesterday (Tuesday). Five toggles have been got in. Both the Pearl and the Rinaldo have been fitted with Merryweather's fire engines, so that, if considered desirable, resort may be had to water ballast. As the lift at the utmost at high water will not exceed 11ft., eight lifts will probably be required to float the sunken vessel into the shallow water in Sandown Bay. The beaching of the vessel has been found to be absolutely necessary, as there is insufficient water in the harbour and fairway at high water to enable the Eurydice to be towed in and docked in much below her normal load-line. It has been proposed to dispense with the lighters altogether. In their stead, and to secure additional buoyancy, two old gunboats, the Wave and the Swan, are to be employed.

*Iron.* – Our prophecy that the "scientific officers" in her Majesty's service would find the Eurydice too much fur them, has, we regret to say, been realised in the most complete manner. There is no doubt that the " fighting officers" in the Royal Navy are, so far as pluck, English grammar, and good manners are concerned, as exeellent gentlemen as any in the service of Britannia. Vicariously they rule the waves for her, but when submarine operations are to the fore they are wofully at fault. The Eurydice affair is a catalogue of melancholy failure. Setting aside the vexed question of seamanship as to her loss, her subaqueous record is full of blundering. The Admiralty very naturally opined that there ought to be somebody about Portsmouth Dockyard who could raise a sunken ship, and orders were forthwith sent to Portsmouth to lift the Eurydice. As it turned out, this decision was unfortunate. Perhaps it might have been as well to employ practical people. Fighting officers always fight well, but they know nothing about raising ships.

*British Medical Journal.* – Both the Royal George and the Eurydice sank in tideways, with very strong currents, which, from the first instant, swept constantly through the hatchways and open ports with searching effect ; so it may be surmised that many unattached floating masses lying in their course would be carried away and rolled into deeper waters or on to the shore. It is a remarkable feature in the Eurydice that so few of the watch on deck floated away from her, and that so very few corpses have been anywhere found. This may perhaps be explained on the suddenness of the struggle for life in the water, and the vortex created by the sinking ship taking them with her to the bottom ; and the same reasons will apply *á fortiori* to the watch off duty and between decks. We think that, by calmly reflecting on such ideas, the minds of those who are now in eager expectation may he brought to a tone conducive to submission to many disappointments on clearance of the vessel.

*Review.* — It was asserted that the frigate had drifted of her own accord from the position in which she lay. The dockyard authorities published a notice, in which they pointed out the incorrectness of this assertion, and naively protested that the ship had not altered her position since she foundered. That protest is also the general complaint of the public. She ought to have altered positin so much as to be now safe in port. We can safely assert that if the Eurydice had been a trading vessel insured in England, she would have been afloat about three weeks ago. Possibly no cable would have been passed round her longitudinally ; probably none would have been passed under her keel. She is so buoyant that hawsers would merely have been passed through her open ports and firmly fixed, and this done she would have been lifted to the surface on the first fine day. We think underwriters may congratulate themmselves on possessing a staff of practical experts who have qualified themselves better than the engineers in Portsmouth dockyard to accomplish the task of raising a sunken vessel.

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

Late on Friday night a storm set in, and the Rinaldo and the Rinaldo and the lumps, which were moored near the wreck of the Eurydice, had to slip their cables and make for port, in tow of the Griuder. The iron toggles wnich the divers succeeded in dropping into the ports will have to be removed, and their places supplied by wooden toggles of greater bearing area, as the former have been found to bend and come cut under the strain of thirteen tons. The Rinaldo was taken back to her moorings on the following day, and the mauly was out at the wreck on Sunday, when two additional toggles were put into position. Shortly after mid-day two coastguardsmen who were on duty at St. Lawrence observed a body floating about three miles out to sea. They at once launched a boat, and succeeded in bringing the body in tow to Ventnor, where it was found to be that of a marine, evidently from the wreck of the Eurydice. Tne features were beyond identification, but it was found that the body is George Falconer. The body was landed that of on the Isle of Wight, and the Coroner, considering an inquest unnecessary, gave an order for the burial which took place on Tuesday afternoon. The body was interred in Ventnor Cemetery with military honours and a large number of the townspeople attended. The Government tugs and divers resumed operations on Monday, but the boisterous weather prevented much progress being made. On Tuesday morning, however, they again proceeded out of harbour to the wreck. As many as a dozen or 16 toggles will be used if they can be successfully introduced into the ports , the hawsers still remain rouud the Eurydice, with buoys to pick them up. The Pearl was finished for service on Monday, and can be brought into requisition on whatever day it is thought advisable. A telegraphic statement of the exact rise and fall of the tide is daily sent from the wreck to the dockyard authorities, so that they may know when the tide is likely to serve, and they are putting their plans into execution with as much dispatch as is practicable, considering the difficulties which have to be encountered, aud the unfavourable turn of the weather. These difficulties are increasing every day, the wreck having within the last week or ten days sunk further in the mud by several feet.

On Tuesday morning, about 11 o'clock, John Gawn, a fisherman of Portsmouth, while near the Warner light, picked up the body of a seaman belonging to the Eurydice. Just before that time George Comer, a fisherman, of Gosport, had picked up another body near the same spot. Both bodies were towed into harbour and were taken to the Gosport Coastguard station, to which place a handcart and coffins were conveyed from Haslar Hospital, and the bodies were placed in them and taken to the dead-house at that place. One of the bodies was that of a young man whose name is supposed to be William Hendy. Both bodies are in a very advanced stage of decomposition.

The Duke aud Duchess of Edinburgh have forwarded to the Lord Mayor a donation of £ 100 towards the support of the widows, orphans, and dependant relatives of the men who lost their lives in the Eurydice.

Mr. E. J. Physick, sculptor, has been commissioned to execute the monument in memory of Lieut. Frank Tabor, R.N., who was picked up in an exhausted condition, and expired shortly after the sinking of H M.S. Eurydice. The memorial will be erected over the grave in Cheam churchyard, Surrey, and the design prepared by Mr Physick is singularly appropriate as a memento of the sad circumstances which caused its erection.

THE EURYDICE.

The inclement weather of the last few days has kept the operations of the wreck in complete obeyance. It is now hoped that the tides will sufficiently answer *within a fortnight* to enable the attempt to be made to lift the Eurydice ! A waterman has succeeded in up Captain Hare's writing desk, and handed it over to the Coastguard at Bembridge, by whom it was forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief. The gales have disturbed the banks of sand and freed many bodies – several of which have been recovered.

On Saturday two more bodies which were decomposed beyond recognition, picked up near the wreck, were, brought into Portsmouth harbour by the steam tug Grinder and conveyed to Haslar Hospital One is evidently a seaman, thother is believed to be a marine. The Rinaldo reports that the body of an officer passed her as she lay anchored near the wreck on Friday night, but the sea was too rough for a boat to be lowered. The body subsequently washed ashore off Sea View, and has been identified as that of Lieutenant Barry. The south cone was hoisted at the semaphore on Saturday evening, and the gale which sprang up during the night prevented the tugs from proceeding out of harbour during Sunday. The squally weather and the heavy gale from the W.S.W. will, it is expected, tend to ease the position of the the wreck, and lead to large numbers of bodies floating through the ports.

FOUNDERING OF H.M.S. EURYDICE.

The prevalence of high winds and strong tides have prevented anything like successful operations being carried out by the authorities engaged in the attempt to raise the Eurydice. The efforts of the party are by no means relaxed, and advantage is taken of every opportunitywhich presents itself. Four bodies, however, have been m recovered since Saturday. The first was that of a marine named George Falconer, which was observed by the Coastguardsmen at St. Lawrence, early on Sunady afternoon. The body was brought ashore by a boat which the Coastguard put off in, and the Isle of Wight Coroner being communimcated with, he did not consider an inquest necessary. Yesterday morning three other bodies were picked up near the Noman Fort and the Warner lightship, by Geofg Connor, flsherman, of Gosport, John Gawn, a boatman, of Portsmouth, and Joseph Briggs. Two of the bodies Were taken to the Gosport shore, and landed at the Coastguard jetty, where they were received by Mr. Stephen George, the Chief Officer of the station.. The officials at Haslar Hospital were communicated with and Inspeetor-General W.T. Domville, C.B., M.D., had coffins sent down to the jetty, and the bodies were conveyed in them to the dead-house at the Hospital. In order that there should be no delay in the identification of the corpses, Mr. Superintendent Cheyney communicated by telegraph with the County Coroner (Edgar Goble, Esq.), who decided to hold the inquest on the bodies at once. The Jury were, in consequence, hastily summoned, and met at Haslar Hospital last evening. The two bodies were identified by Charles Carter, foreman of labourers at the Hospital, who stripped them, and found the names of the men upon the clothing. The bodies were those of Edward Lockett and William E. Sandy, ordinary seamen, second class. An excellent arrangement has been made for the identification of the bodies. The Inspector-General has had a complete list made of the whole of the crew and passengers of the Eurdice-321 in number. The names marked on the clothing of the bodies recovered are compared with this list, and providing there is no other way of recognizing the corpses, identification can be established by this means. Both bodiee were much decomposed, the flesh being entirely removed from the faces, and the hands were also missing. Sandy had on a serge, a flannel, a check shirt, his trousers, &c.; and Lockett had on two flannels and a check shirt and trowsers. The lower jaw of Sandy was a entirely gone. In his trowsers pocket were found one penny piece, three halfpence, and two buttons. Formal evidence of identification was taken, and the inquest was adjourned to the date originally fixed, the 23rd inst. The men who recovered the bodies were bound over to appear then, and also, the two survivors — Benjamin Cuddeford and Sidney Fletcher, the latter being sick, a patient in Haslar Hospital. The funeral of the two men will take place this (Wednesday) afterneon. The third body, which was landed on the Portsmouth side of the harbour, was conveyed in a shell to the dead-house adjoining Portsea police-station. As it had been landed within the jurisdiction of the Borough Coroner, it was thought that an inquest would be held by that gentleman, but it appears that this duplication of depositions is not likely to occur, as the Coroner expressed a desire that if the Chief-Constable were satisfied that the body had come from the Eurydice, it might be conveyed to a Haslar, as he considered it inexpedient that inquiries should be opened in various parts of the county on the same matter. The body, although not identified up to last night, has no doubt come from the ill-fated ship. It has on a pair of laced boots, brown socks, blue cloth trowsers whiteshirt, and drawers, and short blue serge jacket. This latter article leads to the supposition that the body is either that of an officer's servant or steward. At all events he evidently belonged to the non-combatant class. The bones of the head were perfcetly bare, and both bands had been eaten off. The flesh had also come off a considerable portion of the right arm, the bones of which were bared for several inches. The corpse will be removed to Haslar, where it will be stripped, and identification will no doubt be established by the marking of the clothing. Nothing was found in the pockets of the deceased.

FUNERAL OF THE MARINE.

Our Veatnor correspondent telegraphs last night that the funeral of George Falconer, the marine whose body was picked up off Ventnor on Sunday, took place yesterday  afternoon. The hearse containing the body was followed from the Esplanade to Ventnor Cemetery by Captain Roche, R.N., Inspecting-Commander of St. Catherine's Division,; Mr. Clarke, Chief Officer of Ventnor Station; and about twenty Coastguardmen of the Division; fifty-five men of the 5th Isle of Wight Rifle Volunteers (which was a very good muster, considering the short notice given, and the funeral taking place during the working hours), under the command of Captain G. N. Burt and Lieutenant Henry Owen. The *cortège* was headed by the a Battalion band playing the Dead March in *Saul*. Many leading inhabitants of the town also followed in the procession and the greatest sympathy and respect was manifested by the numerous bystanders as the mournful *cortège* wound its way up the circuitous roads leading to the heights ahove Ventnor, on which the Cemetery is situated. The burial service was impressively read by the Rev. W. W. Willan. The firing party of the Volunteers fired three volleys over the grave at the conclusion of the service.

Mr. B. J. Physick, sculptor, has been commissioned to execute the monument in memory of Lieutenant Frank Tabor, R.N., who, it will be remembered, was picked up in an exhausted condition, and expired shortly after. The memorial will be erected over the grave in Cheam churchyard, Surrey, and the design prepared by Mr. Physick is appropriate as a memento of the sad circumstances which cause its erection.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

Writing from Portsmouth on Saturday, a says:—

Within the last ten days no fewer than sixteen bodies from the Eurydice have been picked up. Eight had been recovered up to Thursday. On Friday six were found in the neighbourhood of Chichester, and on Saturday two were brought in to Portsmouth Harbour. One of three was the body of George Curd, an ordinary martian, which was identified by the name on the jacket; and the other was the body of John Mitchell, a chief petty officer and seaman gunner which was identified by his widow by some tattoo marks on his arm.

THE "EURYDICE" FATALITY.

*Republishes the Hampshire Advertiser article of Saturday 25 May 1878, but ends short and slightly differently:*

During the recent gales the Eurydice has sunk two feet and a half further into the mud, and the misgivings as to the possibility of her being raised are now materially strengthened.

THE EURYDICE

Exactly two mouths had elapsed last Sunday since the capsising of the Eurydice, which lies buried still deeper in the sandy bottom, defying the ingenuity of the officials and the vast store of appliances which have been brought into requsition for the purpose of raising the wreck. Anxiety as to the lifting of the ill-fated ship continues, and doubts are expressed as to whether it will ever to come to the surface unless blown up— an idea most repugnant to those having friends on board. Work was attempted again on Sunday, but the tugs had to return in consequence of the high wind blowing. The divers succeeded on Saturday in inserting a toggle into the lee side of the ship. Several more bodies have been picked up on the Sussex coast.

A portion of the wreckage of this vessel has been washed ashore at Rottingdean, and on Friday the bodies of two of the seamen were discovered in the sea near Saltdean. They had evidently been in the water for a considerable time, the feet and hands being eaten away, and they presented altogether a terribly decomposed and shocking appearance. The clothing on the bodies were respectivel) marked "G. Gordon" and "A. Barnes. On Friday evening the body of another seaman was picked up at Lancing. The body was in a very decomposed state, especially about the extremities. The name "J. Appledore" was marked on the guernsey under the collar.

Another body was picked up at Selsey on Monday, but identification was impossible in consequence of the state in which it was discovered.

*The Army and Navy Gazette* remarks :— The statement made by a weekly contemporary that " the efforts made by the Admiralty to raise the Eurydice are nothing more than what is in theatrical parlance termed 'gag'— that in fact, they have never seriously intended to raise her"— is nothing less than fiction. The Admiralty fully intended to raise the ship, and the fault of the whole work has been that those entrusted with the preparations under-estimated the difficulties, and apparently did not take pains to ascertain what kind of bottom she was resting on. That she may never be raised is not now at all beyond belief, but it will be owing to error and not design if she never floats again.

We are inclined to the opinion of many who ought to know something of the matter, that the Eurydice will never be raised. She would, doubtless, have been blown up long ago, but for the effect this would have had on the feelings of the relatives of the unfortunate men, for the *attempt* to raise has cost perhaps as much as two or three Eurydices would ; and even if she were got up she would not be worth anything. We believe she will remain till all the bodies have disappeared, and then a charge of dynamite will cause their temporary coffin to disappear also.

THE CHIEF CONSTRUCTOR ON THE EURYDICE, &c.—

The chief constructor of the Dockyard (Mr. W. B. Robinson), addressing the members of the Literary and Scientific Society, lat week, said that non-attention to science was sure to lead to failure, and sometimes to catastrophe. The capsising of H.H.S. Captain would have been prevented had the officer in command read an article previously written by the present member for Pembroke. That article would have taught him the folly of carrying sail on the ship under the circumstances it was carried when she went down. There was a more recent catastrophe which he would not discuss, but he very much regretted— and it was common enough to regret— that science had not been called in for more than four weeks to devise the best means of raising the Eurydice. It was essential that a man should know enough of ordinary things in a scientific manner, in order to foresee what was likely to happen. The President (Mr. J. Douglas) remarked that it was a disgrace to engineering men that that vessel should remain unraised, and the scandal was the greater that Captain Coppin, of the Steam Salvage Company, offered to raise the Eurydice immediately afer the disaster, but received no reply for nearly a fortnight, when his offer was declined with thanks. As he understood, Captain Coppin had afterwards offered to bring up the bodies from the ship, but this offer was also declined.

ESCAPE OF A RYDE MAN FROM THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

A young man named Hayes, whose mother was a member of the Sivell family of this town, had a very fortunate escape from being lost in the ill0fated ship. About a week before the vessel sailed from the West Indies, hayes was taken ill, and had to be taken on shore to the hospital. His friends at first thought he was drowned, but a letter has, since the disaster, been received, which announced the gratifying fact that Hayes is alive and restored to health.

OPENING OF THE NEW PIER.

Sandown was en fete on Wednesday, the day fixed for the opening of the new pier, and every one seemed impressed with the fact that the event was one of no ordinary importance in the history of the little town. Lady Oglander very kindly consented to perform the opening ceremony, but so unpropitious was the weather at the beginning of the day that for some time it was doubtful whether a postponement would not be necessary. The rain fell all the morning without ceasing, and of course made the roads in the neighbourhood of the pier dirty and muddy ; but, as the hour fixed for the ceremony approached, the sky commenced clearing, and by 3 o'clock it was tolerably fine. A considerable number of persona then began to flock to the pier, the approaches to which were decorated with banners and flags. Across the street which Lady Oglander would have to pass was stretched a banner, bearing the arms of the Oglander family and the motto "Server Munia Vitae," on each side of which was the word " Welcome." Above the street leading to the pier was a banner bearing the words "Success to the Pier," and over the pier gates another, bidding all " Welcome." There was also plenty of bunting about, a number of poles being placed at regular intervals on both sides of the pier, and each carrying a gay flag. With respect to the pier itself, which next claims our notice, it must not be understood that it is actually finished. Only a portion of the structure — half the total length contemplated — is finished, but of course this is sufficient to give a good idea of its general effect, and makes a very nice promenade. Unlike the piers we have seen elsewhere, the seats run down the whole length. From the pierhead can be obtained capital views, not only seaward but of the cliffs, sands, and general scenery of the interior of the Island. The pier looks a very light structure — uncomfortably so, in fact. The iron piles on which it rests are so slight, and their distance one from the other is so great, as to lead one to doubt whether it will be found sufficiently strong to withstand the winter waves which roll into the bay. This uncomfortable feeling was intensified by the appearance of a wreck close at hand — the John Douse— highly suggestive of the stormy waters which the structure will have to withstand ; while further out to sea, and almost in line with the head of the pier, was another dismal sight — the masts of the wreck of the Eurydice, still beneath the waters, and still holding many a score of the bodies of brave young tars. These were two things highly suggestive of what the winds and waves can do about here. We suppose, however, that the lightness of the pier just at the parts which are finished does not matter, and doubtless the structure will be made more substantial as it reaches that portion of the shore where the full fury of the waves will be encountered. However, a pier seems to be a necessity for Sandown, and we congratulate the inhabitants of the little town upon their energy and evident determination to improve the place.

THE OPENING CEREMONY.

Shortly after 4 o'clock the townspeople began to flock to the pier. A number of the members of the Nunwell Volunteers were drawn up on each side of the pier gates, as a sort of guard of honour, under the command of their popular young captain (A. Brook Leeds, Esq.) and Lieut Pound, while the band was stationed at the end of the pier to add harmony to the proceedings. Amongst those assembled at the pier gates to welcome Lady Oglander on her arrival were F. Pittis, Esq. (Mayor of Newport), Col. Currie (chairman of the Ventnor Local Board), Mr. Walter Mew (chairman of the Sandown Local Board), W. H. Wooldridge, Esq (clerk to the Local Board), Mr. Eldridge (town clerk of Newport), the Rev. W. M. Harrison, Dampier Child, Esq , and the following members of the Sandown Local Board : Dr. Bulbeck, Messrs. Linfield, Love, J. K. Hollis, Warne, Pelley, and Box. Lady Oglander arrived punctually at the time fixed, accompanied by Major Leeds, and on alighting from her carriage was received by Mr. Wooldridge, who introduced the Chairman and members of the Sandown Local Board to her ladyship. Mr. Walter Mew (chairman) then stepped forward and presented her ladyship with an address from the Board. In doing so he expressed the great pleasure he felt in seeing her ladyship present, and thanked her for the interest she had always taken in Sandown, at the same time expressing the hope that she would long be spared to them. Mr. Wooldridge then read the address, which was handsomely engrossed on vellum, and signed by 155 ratepayers and inhabitants of the district. It was as follows :

To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Park, Isle of Wight.  
Madam, — We, the Local Board of the district of Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, and the undersigned ratepayers and inhabitants of the district, beg respectfully to express the great pleasure and gratification which it gives us to see your ladyship taking part in, and inaugurating the opening of a Pier in Sandown. We are well assured that your ladyship at all times takes an interest in all ,atters connected with the public welfare of Sandown and its inhabitants ; knowing, as we do, the readiness and liberality with which you have always contributed and assisted all charitable, and other local undertakings, we trust that your ladyship may long be spared aud be able to assist, and participate in all public enterprises which may conduce to the prosperity of the town of Sandown, in which, as Lady of the Manor, we feel sure you will always have a deep and sincere interest. With every expression of respect aud esteem,  
We are, your ladyship's faithful servants,  
Walter Mew, Chairman.

The Common Seal of the Local Board of Sandown was affixed, this 27th day of May, 1873, in pursuance of a resolution unanimously passed at a special meeting, held on the 24th day of May, 1878, in the presence of Mr. H. Wooldridge, clerk to the Board.

Leaning on the arm of Major Leeds, her ladyship then walked to the end of the pier, which had been carpeted for the occasion. Here she was introduced to the chairman and directors of the Pier Company. Her ladyship having briefly declared the pier open, Mr. Jonathan Jolliffe, the chairman of the company, stepped forward and presented her ladyship with another address. He explained that the company had a hard struggle to get the pier completed so far, but they hoped to be able to make the structure double its present length, and to place a lifeboat at the end. It would then be very useful for yachts aud steamers, which would be able to land passengers here. He then presented the address, which was also engrossed on vellum, and read as follows :

To Lady Oglauder, Nunwell Ptrk. Isle of Wight.  
Madam, — The chairman and directors of the Sandown Pier Company beg to welcome your ladyship on this, to them, important occasion, and at the same time express their sincere thanks for your kindness in consenting to preside at the opening of the pier. It is only after having overcome many difficulties, and even local opposition, that the directors have at length succeeded im completiing the first section of the pier, so as to permit the same to be opened for the use of the public. However, they hope to receive such pecuniary assistance from residents, owners of property, and others interested in the welfare of Saudown, as may enable them to complete the original design, and carry out the pier to its full lengih of 650 feet, being nearly double the length of the portion already constructed, and so kindly opened by your ladyship. — The directors are sure that the pier will atford a pleasant and agreeable promenade, and prove a source of attraction to the town of Sandowm and its visitors; and they venture also to hope that it may ultimately prove useful, not only for purposes of recreation, but also a station from which a lifeboat may bo launched. Recent sad events that have taken place in the bay deepen the conviction that Sandown will prove a most important station for a lifeboat. For the carrying out so laudable an object the directors can only trust to the liberality and sympathy of the public generally.— Again thanking your ladyship tor the kind interest you have shown in the work the directors have in hand by your presence here to-day, and with every good wish for your welfare and happiness,  
We beg to remain,  
Your ladyship's obedient aud fitiihful servants  
Jonathan Joliffe,  
Richard Dampier Child,  
George Pelley,  
James Kennington.

The seal of the Sandown Pier Company (Limited) was affixed this 28th day of May, 1878, in pursuance of a resolution duly passed at a meeting of the directors im the presence of W. H. Wooldridge, secretary.

This portion of the ceremony concluded, Miss Brandt stepped forward, and, on behalf of the directors presented her ladyship with a very handsome bouquet. Her ladyship briefly replied as follows; "Mr , Chairman and gentleman of the Sandown Local Board and gentlemen of the Sandown Pier Company -I thank you very much for the kind and gratifying reception you have given me. It affords me at all times siccere pleasure to assist im any way in promoting the prosperity of Sandown, and I trust the undertakimg you have so successfully curried out and inaugurated this day may prove one of the many means of adding to the attractions of the place, and an additional source of health and enjoyment to visitors and inhabitants alike. " Hearty cheers were then given for hey ladyship, and a number of the gemtlement present having been introduced to her, the procession again went up the pier; her ladyship and Major Leeds re-entered their carringe, and drove off amidst the loud cheers of the assembled spectators. This concluded the ceremony, which was followed by

A BANQUET,

which took place at half-past 5, in the Town Hall, where about 70 gnntlemen sat down to the excellent repast provided. The chair was taken by Mr. Jon. Jolliffe, and the vice-chair by Mr. Walter Mew; : there being also present Capt. Brook Leeds, Lieut. Pound, Col. Currie, Rev. W. M. Harrison, Mr. W. H. Wooldridge, Col. Brandt, Mr. F. Pittis, Mr. F. Pittis, jun., Mr. T. H. Urry, Mr. W. H. Barton, Mr. C. G. Vincent, Dr. Meeres, Mr. Binns (engineer), Mr. D. Mitchell, Mr. Linfield, Mr. J. K. Hollis, Mr. L. H. Saunders, Mr. Theodore Saunders, &c. After the removal of the cloth,

Mr. Wooldridge read letters of apology from Mr. Baillie Cochrane, M.P. (who was unable to attend owing to the state of his health), the Mayors of Ryde, Yarmouth (I.W.) and Andover, Mr. F. White Popham, Col. Calthorpe, and others.

The Chairman briefly proposed the usual loyal toasts, which were heartily responded to. He then, proposed "The Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces," coupling with the toast the names of Col. Currie, Col. Brandt, and Capt. Brooke Leeds.

Col Currie congratulated those present upon adding a pier to the attractions of Sandown ; and then, speaking to the toast, said he had seen a great deal of war, and what he had aeen of its horrors led him to hope that peace would be maintained, and if it was maintained with honour to the country it would be the brightest star in the escutcheon of the noble lord who now presided over the destinies of the country (applause).

Col. Brandt, who also responded, was sure that in the present unfortunate discussion England would do her best to be on the right side, and should it end in war the Army, who had never yet been backward when called on, would do its best (applause). God forbid it should end in bloodshed, for he was sure no Englishman wished to see that ; all they wished was to see justice and right done (applause). If we did have a peace he hoped it would not be a patched-up peace, but that the question would now be so settled that there could be no chance of its being brought forward again (applause).

Capf. Brook* Leeds, in responding for the Volunteers, said that the corps he commanded owed a great deal to Sandown, and the numbers who had  joined them from that town enabled them to muster more strongly in proportion than the corps belonging to large and important towns. They would not be able to keep the corps up to this position without the help of Sandown. They had just drafted 15 Sandown men into the corps, and their band was composed five-tenths of Sandown men. Their corps then was virtually, except in name, a Sandown corps. The Volunteers as a body had no politics, and were always ready to do their duty if called on ; but they could not forget that, in spite of the many matters of importance which our present Government had to attend to, they had remembered the Volunteers. A Volunteer commission had been appointed to take into consideration the wants and requirements of the force. Although the Volunteers had their grant there were many other things required, which would no doubt be supplied (applause).

Mr. Dampier Child proposed "The Bishop and Clergy of the Diocese and the Ministers of all Denominations." In spite of certain difference* he thought the Church had the hearty good wishes of all true Englishmen. After regretting the absence of the Vicar, he coupled with the toast the names of the Rev. W. M. Harrison to respond for the Bishop and clergy, and the Rev. Mr. King for the ministers of other denominations.

The Rev. W. M. Harrison said he was extremely pleased to be present on such an auspicious day for Sandown, and he wished their new institution every success. Mr. Dampier Child had alluded to differences of opinion in the Church, but he asked where they did not find differences of opinion. It was so when he was a boy, and he supposed always would be so ; but he believed that, in spite of differences of opinion, his brethren of the Church and those amongst the Nonconformists were coming more into accord, and beginning to see that there was not such a great gulf between them but what they could shake hands ever it. He hoped they would give them credit for that, and would see that though they were parsons on Sunday they had their hearty sympathy on all occasions.

The Rev. Mr. King said he trusted that ministers of all denominations were beginning to see that they were building on one great foundation, and all endeavouring to inculcate one noble principle — good will towards men. He was very pleased to be present on such an occasion. Having been intimately associated with Sandown for a great number of years in greatly rejoiced him to see its increasing prosperity. He believed the construction of the new pier wonld prove a great thing for Sandown, and he hoped that, when completed, it would be crowned with success.

Mr. Pelley in eulogistic terms proposed the health of Lady Oglander, who always took such interest in the town, and had given £10 towards the expenses of the day (loud applause and cheers).

Capt. Leeds responded, and said he wished to tell them what Mr. Wooldridge evidently forgot, that his father, Major Leeds, was unable to be present, and had only been able to attend that afternoon at some risk to himself, for he was very far from well. He thanked them for the hearty way in which the toast was proposed and received. It was unnecessary for him to dilate on the kindness of Lady Oglander. One could not praise one's own relations very well, but he thought they would remember that it was a very difficult matter for any lady to take part in public matters. When, however, Lady Oglander was asked to open the pier, she at once complied, and although the day was not everything which wished, she came and went through the ceremony (applause). It was a pleasmre foe her to do anything to help Sandown. He then thanked them heartily on her behalf.

Mr. L. H. Saunders proposed " Success and Prosperity to the Sandown Pier." He should like to say a few words on the subject, which, as he wad a resident outside Sandown, he hoped would be accepted in all sincerity. The pier so far had been built by a mere handful of men. Fewer men than were assembled in that room had found the capital necessary to build what was nothing less than an institution — the pier which they had seen so ably opened by Lady Oglander that day, and he trusted that all those present, who had not yet done so, had decided to become shareholders. The capital required was £6,000, in 1,200 shares of £5 each, to build a pier 650 feet long, with the object, not only of benefiting the residents, but of bringing an additional number of visitors to Sandown. Perceiving the advantages of such a pier a number of the gentlemen present had put their hands in their pockets, and more than half the capital required had already been subscribed. He thought they ought not to be backward now, for he believed greater profit would accrue now than at the commencement. The pier as at present finished was 350 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it possessed one advantage which they did not often see. He had been on a great many piers, and he found seats generally rather scarce, but on the Sandown pier he noticed that seats ran from end to end, and there was plenty of room for those who could not walk about. He thought that arrangement would greatly contribute to the success of the undertaking. All that was wanted now was the means tor providing the remainder of the money required, ami for an outlay of another £2,500 or so they would be able to complete the pier to the length he had mentioned, so that they would always have nine or ten teet of water at the end of the pier, sufficient for steamers to come alongside at all times and take up or put down excursionists. Although they had a railway to Sandown they wanted something more— accommodation by water, and he hoped to find no difficulty in doing that. He believed it was a fact that all the preliminary expenses of this company—-getting the Bill in Parliament,&c.— in fact, all their Parliamentary expenses, were covered by a cheque for £200. That was sufficient to show that there was no promotion money paid, and he thought such a company, with responsible directors and not overweighted, must be a success. The directors, in addition to the large amount of shares they had taken, rather than open tho pier with any liability upon it, had given their names and taken a personal liability for £200 each beyond their holding. That showed the sort of opinion the directors had of the undertaking. In proposing the toast he hoped that every Sandown man would take a share. — The toast was received with three times three.

The Chairman said they were going to carry on the undertaking in an honest, straightforward way and if they only revived support They would make the pier oue of the best litile properties in the Isle of Wight. He had spent a great deal of time and money on the Newport Junction Railway, and if that had only been carried out as he said it ought to have been it would now be paying cent. per cent. A very small sum, only £2,000 more, was required to have the pier 650 ft. long, and not a penny of the money subscribed should be spent except on the pier (cheers).

The Mayor of Newport briefly responded to the toast of his health, and expressed the interest which was taken by the inhabitants of the capital of the Island in the progress and prosperity of Sandown. The easy distance of Sandown from Newport, and its many attractions would make it especially interesting to the inhabitants of the centre of the Island. With respect to the pier he considered it one of the most promising business investments in the Island.

The toast of "The Chairman and Directors", coupled with the name of Mr Binns, followed.

Mr. Binns said it was now some years since he attended the first meeting of the promoters of a scheme for the erection of a pier in their beautiful bay, and being of opinion that something of the sort would be a great acquisition to Sandown he most willingly advocated and supported the movement. A committee was formed and very quietly worked its way, and some three or four years after the plans of the proposed pier— a wooden structure with girders 7ft. deep and 40ft. span, supported on two 12in. cast-iron columns — were sent to him, with the request that he would undertake to superintend its creation, which he declined on the grounds that such a structure was not only out of date, but inelegant. He therefore suggested and got out a design for the structure, which they had this day had the pleasure of opening. The pier, so far as it extends, consists of seven bays of 50ft, span ; in each bay they are three girders 48ft. 9in. in the clear, and 3ft. deep, supported by three cast-iron columns firmly embedded in the gault or "blue slipper," than which nothing could make a firmer foundation. The principal novelty in the structure consists in the dolphin brackets and seat standards. The former are firmly bolted to vertical channel irons forming part of the lattice girder, and on the top of each bracket is bolted an ornamented seat standard ; consequently the two rows of seats, which are continuous throughout the entire length of the pier, are quite independent of the deck planking, which can at any time be taken up for repair, turned over, or renewed without interfering or in any way disturbing the seats.

Col. Brandt proposed the toast, of " The Sandown Local Board," and took a general review of the duties connected with the office of a member of the Local Board, and the difficulties standing in the way of a conscientious discharge of those duties.

Mr. W. Mew, in replying to the toast, assured them that he fully intended, as long as he had the honour of holding his present position at the Board, to faithfully and conscientiously carry out the duties entrusted in his hands.

The toast of "The Visitors " was ably proposed by Mr. W. H. Wooldridge, and responded to by Mr. Linfield, of Ventnor.

Mr. Pittis proposed in deservedly eulogistic terms. "The health of the secretary of the Pier Company," Mr. W. H. Wooldridge.

Mr. Wooldridge, in acknowledging the warm manner in which the toast had been received, very grotesquely described the difficulties of the day, and trusted he had been successful in surmounting those and other general difficulties connected with his office as well as it could reasonably be expected a man could do.

The toasts of "The Ladies" and "The Press" brought the proceedings to a close.

THE EURYDICE. ACROSTIC ON THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

By J. S. Edwards, Sailor on H.M.S. Royal Adelaide.

Each heart was light and hopeful on board that noble ship,  
Unconscious of the danger near before the sundown dip  
Revealing to the light of day, 'midst white sails spread around,  
Youth's gallant form and manhood strong, that now in death are found.  
Dread cloud of woe which overcast their brightest hopes in night,  
Immersing in engulfing death, the brave, the loved, the bright.  
Come England, spread thy gen'rous hand in pity o'er their grave, Endeavouring thus to honour those entombed beneath the wave.

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Lords on Monday,  
Lord Dorchester asked Her Majesty's Government whether any and, if so, what steps had been taken since a first attempt, that failed, to raise H.M. S. Eurydice, sunk off Dunnose on the 24th March last ; whether there had been any consultations relating thereto between the dockyard and other naval authorities, and whether any eminent engineers, civil or military, had been invited to give their opinions ; also whether any firms, such as " The Steamship Salvage Company" or other persons experienced in such matters, had been invited to afford assistance towards or to tender for raiding the vessel ; and whether there was any objection to produce any papers relating thereto. The noble lord said that there were three or four large firms in this country with special appliances for raising ships. One of them had entered into a contract to raise the Vanguard. Within four miles of where the Eurydice was lying a large ship had been raised by one of these firms. He believed that competent authorities denounced the means taken for raising the Eurydice, and it was scarcely creditable to the first maritime Power in the world that the ship should have been lying for ten weeks in ten fathoms of water.

Lord Elphinstone, before answering the question just put to him, wished, in reply to an enquiry made by a noble lord on Friday night, to say that there was to be no naval review off Portsmouth this week. As to the question of the noble lord (Lord Dorchester), he was not surprised at it. Many persons who were interested in the matter were imperfectly acquainted with what was doing and had been done. They were unaware of the difficulties to be overcome, and expressed surprise at the apparent slow progress made in raising the Eurydice. He was very glad the noble lord had given him an opportunity of explaining at somewhat greater length than on previous occasions the difficulties the naval authorities had had to contend against. The question embraced four distinct subjects. With regard to papers, there were really none, except a short daily journal kept by the officer in charge of working parties. This would show better than any words of his the difficulties which had to be encountered. It was made up to the 29th ult., and would show that out of the 67 days since the ship sank the working had only been able to work during portions of 27 days, sometimes for not more than one or two hours out of the 24. During 40 days they had been unable to work at all on account of the weather. The divers had only been able to work 80 hours in all. The lighters had to slip their moorings and run into harbour for shelter no fewer than 11 times, and had to slip again last Saturday. There was no objection to laying that journal on the table. He thought he mentioned on a former occasion that the Admiralty decided from the first that the business of raising the Eurydice should be entrusted to the dockyard authorities at Portsmouth, where there was a most efficient staff of officers, both scientific and practical, who meet in consultation almost daily. They were presided over by the Admiral Superintendent, Admiral FolEy, who was assisted by the Chief Constructor, Mr. Robinson ; Captain Polkinghorne, Master Attendant ; Captain Batt, Master Attendant of Chatham dockyard, who was employed for a considerable time in connection with the operations at the wreck of the Vanguard; Captain Dathan, Captain Moss, and Captain Palmer, Staff Commanders. It would be difficult to get together a stronger or a better Board. They were all agreed in thinking that under the circumstances of the case, and with the appliances at their disposal, no plan could be adopted more likely to ensure success than the one they were at present endeavouring to carry out. They were animated with but one desire, and that was to succeed, and no exertions were being spared in order to attain that result. The Admiralty had not invited the opinion of any civil engineer. The matter was one which the scientific and the pracical skill the Department had at its disposal at Portsmouth dockyard was quite able to deal, and he very much doubted whether there was any civil engineer who had had any experience whatever in raising weights such as that with which the authorities had to deal and under similar circumstances. He need scarcely add that it had not been felt necessary to invite the opinion of any military men. For the same reasons as those which he had already mentioned, they had not invited the assistance of the Steamship Salvage Company or any person experienced in raising vessels, and he was not aware that either the Steamship Salvage Company or, indeed, any other person had any experience in raising vessels under the circumstances of the present case. There were cases of ships having been saved, and, indeed, of having been raised in smooth water and out of a strong tideway, but there was no instance on record of a ship having been raised under circumstances similar to or in any approaching those in which the Eurydice was placed. The only case at all resembling the present was that of H.M.S. Pincher, a schooner of 180 tons, sunk in 14 fathoms of water off the Owers, in 1837, and it was four months before they succeeded in getting her into Portsmouth harbour. The Admiralty had been inundated with offers. Now, as to the steps which were being taken, he would remark that they had to deal with a deadweight of between 400 and 500 tons, lying 12 fathoms below water in a strong tideway, with a current running between four and six knots an hour, and with slack water varying from 30 to 90 minutes. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a spot on the whole coast of Great Britain where greater difficulties existed in regard to such an operation — difficulties not only below water on account of the tide, but also difficulties above water on account of the tide and the weather combined for a nasty sea got up at that spot very quickly with the slightest provocation. The Eurydice sank on the 24th March, and it was not until the 27th April that they were able to make an attempt to move che wreck. They did so by means of two corvettes — the Rinaldo and ihe Pearl — which had been temporarily converted into lighters. That attempt failed on account of the breaking of one of the hawsers, and then, after consultation on the part of the Board to which he had referred, it was determined by the authorities at Portsmouth to adopt what might be called tho over-lift principle, which simply meant that, instead of placing the lighters round the sunken ship as before, they would be placed immediately over her. They would be attached to the wreck by eight steel hawsers toggelled through her main-deck poits, and six jewel hawsers would also be passed round the ship. In addition to that, it was intended to make use of her two bower cables, and also of the Russian air bag, which had a lifting capacity of 40 tons. That would give some idea, of the difficulties which had to be overcome. No fewer than 16 different attachments had to be made, and an equal strain brought to bear upon them all. Should it come on to blow, or any sea get up, those attachments must all be slacked and probably let go, the lighters would have to seek shelter in port, as they had had to do no fewer than 11 times already, and the whole work would have to be begun ever again when the weather settled. But that was not all. It was supposed that the bottom where tho Eurydice sank was hard ground, and so it was. There was a crust of hard ground, but below that was soft, fine sand. It would appear that the ship struck the ground with great force, for her starboard cathead was knocked away and a portion of her keel was sticking out under her stern. The result was that the hard crust was broken, and the ship had been gradually settling in the soft sand. During the late gales she was settling bt the rate of 2in. a day Fortunately she was not settling any more at present. But she was now 11 1/2ft. in the sand, and out of that hole she had to be lifted and placed upon a new bed. That once done the main difficulties would be practically overcome ; and if the weather would only hold up he hoped the work might soon be successfully accomplished, although he was bound to add that he no longer looked upon it as in any way a matter of certainty. But this he would say, that not nil the "eminent engineers," civil or even military, aided by the Steamship Salvage Company or any private firm, could have hastened the raising of the Eurydice by one hour. In conclusion, he had a plan of the manner in which it was sought to raise the ship that he would be happy to show the noble lord.

Lord Dorchester asked whether the attempt to raise her would be more to-morrow.

Lord Elphinstone said that would depend entirely on the weather.

THE EURYDICE.

The gale on Monday night and Tuesday has led to a suspension of the operations at the wreck of the Eurydice. W. H. Smith, rigger diver, and three London divers slept on board the Rinaldo on Monday night, being ordered to commence the work of shackling the toggles immediately the tide answered. The high winds and a rough sea, however, rendered it advisable to return into harbour, and three Government tags were dispatched to bring in the four lighters and the divers' boats. For some time it was impossible to get the tug alongside the Rinaldo for the purpose of taking on board the men employed at the wreck, and one of a tug's crew got overboard and narrowly escaped drowning. After the divers' boats had been taken in tow and were being brought by Bembridge Ledge, where the full force of the gale was felt, one broke adrift, and the three others were considerably damaged, the rigger divers' boat losing its port bow, another most of its after-part, and the other its stern and gunwhale, as well having its diving apparatus disabled. It was not expected that the boats could be floated into harbour, but this difficulty being overcome they were at once put into the dockyard hands for immediate repair, the divers to be supplied with others till they have been rendered serviceable. During the gale, two men were disabled, the engineer of the lighter having his leg broken, and a lighter-keeper sustaining injuries to his face. The Rinaldo being secured to strong moorings was able to ride out the storm. If the weather does not at once abate it will become impossible to take advantage of the high tides of this month. The wreck has already been swept with four 8 inch wire hawsers, and all the toggles intended to be used, numbering about 18, have been introduced into the ports, so that only the toggles have to be shackled, the hawsers jewelled, and the fore and mizen masts removed preparatory to the attempt to float the Eurydice, which, with favourable weather, has been fixed for Sunday or Monday.

THE EURYDICE.

Conettnnom eyries Imo torra—On Wednesday last Mr. Edgar tioble, one of the coroners for Dante, teaclothsl the inquiries into the death of the unfortunate men drowned in the Eurydice. The evhleneo sem confined to that of the survivors, Cuddiford and the boy Sydney Fletcher. There narratives were subetantially the samosa the admitted by them at previous inquiries. Some new facts, however, were Avowed. Clekliferd stated that there was not the slightest ioditation of the spoilt rowing on before the Ship stank, and he did not thiult the wind headed her during the whole time. To the lust the captain mire his orders in a clear and distinct voice, and at the time the ship went down all the ports were open ex c ept tan. They were owned in the forenoon by the acres of the mate of the deck, and the ship at the time she struck was going at about eight knots. From the time the order wax given to ehorten sail to the time she heeled over about six minutes elapsed. From the :hue she heeled over to going down was only a minute, The captain was on deck the whole of the afternoon, and iu witness's opinion everp bite: was done to save the ship. He believed that none of the four guns broke loose. The ship was more lively than usual from the amount of water and provisions but if they had commuted all the water the ship would have been properly ballasted. lie did not believe that Captain Hare was aware that the ports were open. Considering the state of the weather be wane( opinion that the ship was in a wife condition. She was not under too great a prect of trail previous to the storm. Mr. (Afford, a sub-lieutenant, was at the wheel, but there was always a quartermaster there. As a seaman of 21 pars' e xperience, he believed that no blame attached to either officers or men for the loss of the ship. The Coroner, in concluding the inquiry, said the Admiralty did not propose to offer any scientific evidence. It would be for the jury to my whether the captain had caused a proper look-out to kept, because if he had nut it would amount to a neglect of duty, for which he would have had to answer had ho survived. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased came to their deaths by drowning through the foundering of the Eurydice, but that no blame attached to the captain, fficers. or crew. Another body has been recovered from the wreck—that of C. Wilkins, one of the crew, found found in the forechains. In opening the en: quiry, the Coroner (E. Goble, Esq.) observed that the body upon which evidence would be given was supposed to be orte of the crew, of the Eurydice, and his clothes were marked "C. Wilkins." It would be the duty of the jury to ins nine whether the indentity of the deceased' had been proved to their satisfaction, and also to ascertain the cause of death. It was nut his intention at present to go into any further in. quiry. They haul received the verdict of two juries with regard to this catastrophe, and therefore all they need now do was to prove the identity of the body and find the comet of &nth. eiterge foreman of the laborers at the Hospital, said the body was brought to the ads petal thattlay by some laborers of the Dockyard. Ile gave formal evidence as to the chattel which were worn by the decreased, and which Foetid his identity, the name being on the waistband and trousers. The deceased was picked up in the for...chains of Ii.M.S Eurydice. inspector-General Doraville handed in the card trout the Admiralty, stating that C. Wilkins was a seawall on beard the Eurydice —The inquiry was adjourned. During the last few days of fine weather co, .iderable rrogress has been made at the wreck, hoth the wizen and fore masts having been pulled out by the tugs and a spaee cleared for the attachment of the lifting ships. On Tueb. day morning the last of the four lighters was towed out of liArbour to the wreck, and should I nc preaent weather continue, an at. empt to raise the Lurytlieu will ho made to. Tire loss of the Eurydice has set thousands of pens agoing,and many thonsandsof tongues. Many inn varied are the opinions as to the easee of the melaneholy disaster, and it is some satisfaction—mournful it is true—to know that in the opinion of the jury which has enquired into the loss of the Eurydice. the disaster was the result of an accideut and no blame can be attached to the captain or any of the officers or men under him. It was the first thought that the vessel under too great a press of canvas, seeing what the weather was before the squall came on; but the evidence showed that there were two watches, with at least a hundred men in each, that the watch on the deck at the time was plenty to manage the ship, and that had there been more men they would have been in each other's way. Too often disasters of this kind are caused becama. some blundered," hut in this instance everything was done that human foresight and judgment eould direct, and the collision must be attributed solely to a meet direful "freak " Nature, for which the unfortunate victims (-linnet be held responsible. The only consolation is that no one MD be blamed but Nature herself, who cannot he hell amenable to the British laws rind constitution. Bow TO Rates VESSELS. — Writing with regard to the unsuccessful attempts to raise the Eq. !pike, a correspondent says :—.% few yours ago, the Workington, a full-rigged ship of 2,000 tons, laden with (vials, andou tire, was scuttled in the roads, and settled into soft mud, that her topsail yards were only visible above the water. She was bought bye French. man. He at once secured all her top-hamper for staging on which to erect purchases (and did not strip her, as the Eurydice was stripped) to discharge her cargo with and work his divers' pumps from. He had strong Pampero winds, and three or four knot currents to contend against ; however, by working both day and night, and in as bad and exposed position as though the ship had been off the lsle of Wight, he discharged all the cargo of coals, then commenced to fill the hold with wine casks, which were stored below by six divers. The casks had an inch hole bored in each head, then tilled with water and a long spigot placed in the holes, then slung in a chain lowered to the divers (the chains helping to sink the cask) and placed into position by them ; when there they had only to take out both plugs, insert the end of the air nozzle into one hole and blow the water out by the other, then pluugg them both up, when the cask would be tilled with air. Upon one calm day they thus placed 250 casks. They stuck to the job for nine weeks, and brought the ship out of her Led in which she had settled 13 feet deep into the harbour. The tremendous force of the united efforts of the casks had burst her upper deek and so strained her deck beams that they had to be taken out and repaired. The ship, under the name of Perteno, is now afloat, and has made many profitable voyages for her owner. Now, the divers told no they experienced no difficulty while working in the hold from current or rough water. but were only troubled by the darkness and the slippery settlements left on all footing by the sand delimits, of which the hold had at least fifty tons, and this had to be lifted with the iron hull of the ship, iron lower masts, bowsprit, lower yards, and all deckgear. lu another case a wooden brig was cut down by a steamer to the water's edge, and was treated in a like manner, only that the immense hole in her aide had to le planked and covered with canvas. She was succeed- Wily brought into harbour, although seven tailed outside when she went down, and in the channel where the whole force of the river is constantly running at tour to fourandsa-half knots, and not three days without a blow more or less severe.

H.M.S. EURYDICE.

No fewer than three questions are to put to Ministers the House of Commons this evening with regard to the ill-fated Eurydice. Hitherto, owing to a variety of circumstances, it has not been found possible to raise the vessel. Eor many weeks after the disaster the weather was exceptionally rough and tempestuous, the tackle was not found sufficiently powerful to raise so enormous weight, and the prevalence of certain winds, combined with the action of the tide, have caused the hull the ship to become partly imbedded in the sand. The public residing in the Isle of Wight, in the neighbourhood of the scene of the disaster, and who appreciate the enormous difficulties in the way of recovering the ship, have given up the hope of ever seeing it afloat again. So thinks Mr. Baillie Cochrane, the member for the island, who proposes to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, "as appears tthat the ship cannot be raised," it would not better to fix a buoy over the place where she lies "as a memorial of the gallant men who lost their lives while in the public service." Another honourable member, assuming also that the ship cannot be floated by the means at the disposal of the Admiralty, will ask whether "my lords" will not invite tenders from parties willing to contract with the Admiralty to raise and deliver the Eurydice afloat in Portsmouth harbour? The latter question assumes that there are responsible persons willing to undertake the raising of the ship at their own risk, circumstance which may doubted. If the Eurydice is destined ever again to "walk the waters" the probability is that the Admiralty will find the means of accomplishing the object. But as no public matter, large or small, can be adjusted without the junior member for Dundee, Mr. Edward Jenkins will ask yet another question on this now somewhat threadbare subject. The honourable member proposes to ask the First Lord a question to which answer has already been given in the affirmative, namely, whether is intended to hold on inquiry into the loss of the ship. Mr. Jenkins also proposes to ask how the court is constituted, and the Admiralty has considered whether it would advantageous to the public service that one or two experts, other than officers in her Majesty's navy, should form part of the court and various other details.

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Commons on Monday, Mr. David Jenkins said I wish to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty when it is intended to hold a naval inquiry into the loss of her Majesty's ship Eurydice; how it is proposed that the court should be constituted ; and whether he has considered if it would be advantageous to the public service that one or two experts, other than officers in her Majesty's navy, should form part of the oourt : and, whether he inform the House what weight of ballast was put on board when this ship was last commissioned, and of what it consisted; if the water in tanks or any portion of the other stores was relied upon to ensure her stability ; and, if so, what were the nature and weight of such stores.

Mr. W. H. Smith said the court-martial, in accordance with the Navy Discipline Act, has been delayed simply for the purpose of obtaining some valuable evidence as to the condition of the ship before she sank, which it was expected would be forthcoming when the ship was raised. The Board do not permit experts to be placed upon the court, but the court can call any one they choose in order to obtain evidence. The weight of iron ballast the Eurydice carried was 30 tons, the same as she carried previously. As to the last part of the second question, namely, that with reference to water ballast and stores, that will be the subject of inquiry before the court, and it is one to which I cannot give an answer.

Mr. D. Jenkins gave notice that on a future day he should call attention to the subject.

Mr. Baillie Cochrane. M.P. for the Isle of Wight, also asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it seemed impossible to raise the Eurydice, it would not be better to place a buoy over the place where she lies, with some memorial of the gallant men who perished there.

Mr. W. H. Smith : It is not considered to be impossible to raise the ship, and further attempts will he made to do so next spring tides, if the weather permits. To place a buoy over the wreck permanently would be a serious obstruction to navigation. (Hear, hear.)

The salvage operations at the wreck have made considerable progress, favored by a continuance of fine weather, and from Monday till Friday the divers will only be engaged in cutting away such running gear as would be likely to drag on the ground when the ship is raised. The Eurydice has now been swept with four 8-inch steel hawsers, and heavy toggles, with double wire strops, have been introduced into the ports. To these strops 1? inch chain pendants have been shackled on, and when the lift is given the ends of these will be in the mooring lighters. In addition to the 8-inch wire ropes, the bight of an 8-inch wire rope has been dropped before the mainmast into the gangway ports, and the ends poised aft under each quarter have been centred or feilddled under the stern, and will be taken in by the Pearl. In addition to her 8-inch hawsers, the Rinaldo will have the two fore ends of the inch hawser. The Wave and Swan are ready for their work. These two ships will take in as many of the toggle pendants as the ships will ride ever, and all the ships will previously have been sunk three or four feet by allowing that amount of water in them, which will be discharged by powerful steam pumps so soon as the ships have been hove down to the wreck. The Popoff air bag has been placed on the weather side in the gangway and successfully inflated, and the divers have carefully inspected all the toggles and hawsers now they are in position, and report them to be fixed satisfactorily. On Saturday a beautiful inkstand belonging to Captain Hare was recovered by one of the divers, and also a signal log, two white ensigns, and an Italian ensign, all four being unserviceable. On Saturday evening the whole of the divers, riggers and camber men were brought in from the wreck, having succeeded in completing the necessary preliminary arrangements. On Saturday next 400 hands will be taken out to the wreck for the purpose of tightening up the gear and fixing the purchases, and on Monday and Tuesday next, when the tides will have increased upwards of two feet in rise, the first lift will be made. Should the operators succeed in getting the ship out of the hole in which she lies embedded, the lifting vessels, which will be in the first instance placed across the wreck and immersed some two feet, so as to secure an additional rise as the water is pumped out, will then be fastened alongside, and the process repeated until the ports of the Eurydice have been brought above the water level.

The Eurydice.

Mr. Jabiz Hughes has obtained some really remarkable views of the wrecked Eurydice as she lies of St. Helen's. The great defect in all the photos hitherto obtained is that they are taken from so great a distance that the wrecked ship bears but an insignificant part in the general view. Mr. Hughes appears to have taken his picture instantaneously from some boat close to the wreck, the position of the ship being accurately shown, as well as the men on her deck searching for the bodies, &c. The photographs are printed by the permanent process.

PORTSMOUTH, WEDNESDAY. SEPTEMBER 4.

We shall soon have heard the last of the ill-fated Eury1dice. The finding of the Court-martial was generally anticipated by the public, and it is understood that the bringing of the vessel into harbour will be quickly followed by her breaking up. The catastrophe of the 24th of March last was one of the darkest in the annals of the British Navy, and yet it is apparently destined to leave only the shadow of a sad memory behind. It has been said that the first impulse of our countrymen after any great disaster is to " hang somebody." This temper has been a good deal satirised, and yet it has to a large extent a strictly logical foundation. The scientific mind is slow to ascribe anything to pure accident. A catastrophe may have been unforeseen, but it is generally discovered on investigation that its cause is perfectly intelligible, and such as extreme vigilance might have detected, and consequently avoided. When the sad intelligence of the foundering of the Eurydice was first made known, we expressed the opinion that fearful as were all the circumstances surrounding the loss of the vessel, it would be still more terrible were the conclusion to be reached, after mature deliberation, that the cause of the disaster was a complete mystery. The verdict of the first Coroner's Jury, which exonerated everybody from blame, was clearly not entitled to serious attention. No scientific or technical evidence was taken, and a single sitting sufficed for the inquiry. This cannot be said of the recent Court-martial, which, arriving at the same conclusion, has spent a working week in its attempt to elucidate the mystery. The finding of the Court may be divided into two parts-first, that which relates to the stability of the ship ; and secondly, that which concerns her handling at the time she went down. On the first point there appears to be no ground for any difference of opinion. Admitting the incompetence of all but experts to deal with the technicalities of the subject, it cannot be said to require any special knowledge to judge of the value of the evidence bearing upon this branch of the inquiry which was laid before the Court-martial. The Eurydice had always the reputation of being a good sailor, and it must now be regarded as beyond dispute that her conversion from a frigate into a training-ship in no degree diminished her stability. It is true the question of her stability was not specially considered when the plans for her conversion were originally under discussion, but this was only because the proposed changes were obviously such as to require no examination on this point. Since his attention has been particularly directed to this subject, Mr. Barnaby has come to the conclusion that the Euryjdice rather gained than lost in stability by her conversion, and Mr. W. B. Robinson is of the same opinion. Whatever, then, was the cause of the catastrophe it cannot be attributed to any positive or even comparative defects in the ship herself.

This should lead us to examine the other branch of the subject all the more closely. If the Eurydice foundered from no inherent fault of her own, was there anything in her handling on the fatal Sunday afternoon which caused the terrible result? The Court-martial declares that there was not, and yet the very language of the finding raises doubts which cannot, and honestly speaking, ought not to be suppressed. The immediate cause of the catastrophe was, of course, the sudden storm which for a few minutes raged with cyclonic fury, but as other vessels rode it out in safety some further explanation is obviously required. This is, in effect, acknowledged by the Court, which proceeds to say that " some of the upper ports on the main deck were open at the time, which materially conduced to the catastrophe," though the important addition is made that this step " was justifiable and usual under the state of the wind and weather up to the time of the actual occurrence of the storm." Here we reach the very root of the whole inquiry. Did the state of the weather really permit of such confidence as was displayed on board the Eurydice? The barometer had been falling for a couple of days or more, while the indications of a coming storm, though it may be " partially hidden," as the verdict recites, " by the proximity of the ship to high land," was so far apparent that the order to shorten sail had already been given and was actually in process of being obeyed. Is it wrong or uncharitable, under these circumstances, to surmise that the course pursued amounted to an error of judgment? It was impossible to anticipate the altogether exceptional fury of the gale, but would not the exercise of a little caution have made all the difference between entire safety and utter destruction? "It must be understood," observes the Times, in dealing with this part of the case, " that in the naval service a creeping servitude to caution would be intolerable." This principle is no doubt admirable in the exigencies of actual warfare, but it cannot be said to have any application to a vessel when simply making for port and within sight of "home." To suppose otherwise would be to infer that the commander of the Eurydice and his gallant companions knew the risk they were running, and were determined to brave it at all hazards. Fortunately no such foolhardy intention can be attributed to them. That each man did his duty according to his lights will be admitted by the most exacting of critics. What is not so certain is that the soundness of judgment exhibited on this occasion was of apiece with that courage and indomitable resolution which the British sailor evinces in every emergency.

The Diving at the Wreck of the Eurydice.

With reference to the amount paid to the divers in connection with the raising of the Eurydice, Messrs. Siebe and Gorman, submarine engineers to the Royal Navy, write that they had four men engaged at the wreck, and not three, as stated, and that it was only their foreman diver who received £1 5s. per tide. During the four months that operations were carried on the men were working day and night, and the pay they received was in the aggregate the same as that of the dockyard divers.

H.M.S. Atalanta.

Two hundred pinds offered by the Admiralty as a reward for any one giving definite information as to the cause or the locality of the loss of the missing training ship will be regarded by the relatives and friends of the poor fellows on hoard as an indication that there is no longer room for the slightest doubt as to the dreadful nature of the catastrophe. Even the official mind, which is slow to admit the occurrence of events prejudicial to itself, by the issue of this notice reluctantly places upon record the fact that the last gleam of hope for the safety of the ship and her precious cargo of human lives has vanished. It is now a melancholy certainty that the ship which was sent to sea by the Admiralty in the place of the Eurydice has met with a precisely similar fate — that she has been blown over and swalowed up by the pitiless waves, and that at one fell swoop has the desolation of death been carried to over three hundred homes. The country from end to end is thrilled with horror by this terrible calamity, and already the demand has gone forth that the Admiralty itself shall be placed upon its trial in order to the prevention of the recurrence of such woful mishaps. Although the reward of £250 has been offered, we much doubt whether we shall ever obtain reliable information as to the exact spot, or the time, or the method of the foundering. There is no doubt but that she went down carrying with her every trace of the accident, and whatever wreckage may be thrown up hereafter will have travelled so far in deep sea currents as to be valueless save as mementoes of the dead, The disaster is so awfully dreadful that it is impossible as yet to think or to write of it with calmness.

THE ATALANTA.

*The Brighton Gazette* of Thursday is responsible for a somewhat extraordinary statement concerning the missing training-ship Atalanta. It says : "We have special information from an authentic source that so long ago as the 4th of May a sailor of the mercantile marine, whose name is known, and who has been sometime in Newhaven and Brighton, communicated direct to the Admiralty full particulars, or at least the means of obtaining full particulars, and giving the reason why he was unable or afraid to come forward in the matter himself. This communication seems to have been ignored, and on the 12th or 13th he wrote again, saying he knew what certain parties were making out of the retention of the facts, and that he thought it wrong they should be longer withheld. This was again ignored, but the next day or so the Admiralty sent a letter for insertion in the daily papers, saying that they thought all hope of the Atalanta must now be abandoned!" The journal suggests that the offer of a reward was probably made with the view of inducing the man to come forward, but the same influence which prevented his coming forward in the first instance will probably have the same effect now. The *Gazette* concludes with a significant remark. It says : "When we add the fact, which is beyond all doubt — that during the present week certain not obscure persons, both in Brighton and London, have had in their hands a chart 'lined ' and marked with minute details of the Atalanta, at a date since any official or other information can be obtained of her, or is ever likely to be, we think we are justified in saying a very great mystery surrounds the whole matter, and that our information is special and extraordinary."

Mr. Edward H. Capper, of Cardiff, in discussing the loss of the Atalanta, calls attention to the suggestion frequently made that she may have capsized like the Eurydice. He points out that the Eurydice did not capsize, but foundered because when lying over heavily under a press of canvas she filled through her lee ports, which were open. He adds that he was never in any ship which would not have done the same.

The Secretary of the Royal Naval School, New Cross, writes : " I have the pleasure to acquaint you that at a meeting of the Council of the Royal Naval School, held at New Cross, on Tuesday, I was directed at once to ascertain the number of children of officers of ward-room rank left fatherless by this sad calamity, with a view to receiving their sons into this school on such terms as the circumstances in each case may render necessary."

In the history of lost vessels probably the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty never took so much trouble to obtain intelligence as in the case of the missing Atalanta. In prosecuting enquiries, letters have been addressed to the following maritime nations, requesting that captains of vessels should be instructed to keep a look-out for ahy trace of the missing ship: France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austro-Hungary, Greece, Chili, and the United States of America. The foregoing Powers are those who have recently combined with England in a new and important system of international ocean signalling. The ready acquiescence manifested by all the maritime governments of the earth makes it evident that there is a world-wide sympathy with England, and an anxiety to aid in ascertaining the fate of those 300 youths whose disappearance is at present involved in mystery. At tbe present time there must be some thousands of vessels on the watch.

THE ATALANTA DISASTER.—

The Plover, gun boat, Commander Steward, as to whose safety there were serious misgivings until intimation of her arrival at Vigo was received, reached Spithead on Wednesday morning with five ordinary seaman who belonged to the Atalanta, but who, happily for themselves, did not take passage in her when she left Bermuda. These and an ordinary seaman named Varling are all who remain of the crew, and they will, it is understood, be examined by the Court appointed to investigate the circumstances connected with the disappearance of the vessel. The men give the Atalanta a very bad character.
