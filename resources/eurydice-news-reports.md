The major closure of Brading Haven to form what is now known as Bembridge Harbour was started in 1874 and finally finished, after several abortive attempts, in 1880. After this work was completed the ownership of the Harbour passed into the hands of the local railway company. It passed to the Southern Railway after the First World War and then British Railways following nationalisation. It eventually passed back into private hands in 1968.

In 1864, the Bembridge Railway, Tramway and Pier Act was passed by Parliament, authorising the construction of land-reclamation works and the building of a pier. By 1878 over 800 acres of land were reclaimed, and a pier built. Bembridge Harbour Pier was only 250ft long, and quite narrow too. Despite this, it was used by ships such as the 46 tonnes Tynemouth, and after the harbour had been dredged to allow larger ships, such as the 125ft. Island Queen in 1878 and in 1892 the 104 tonnes, 137ft paddle steamer Princess of Wales, which was re-named the Bembridge. This was run by the Southsea and Ventnor Steamship Company. This later merged with the Southsea, Ventnor, Shanklin and Sandown Steamship Company to become the Bembridge and Seaview Steamship Company in 1912. Ships which called at Bembridge regularly on a passenger service included the Sandringham, Prince, Duke of York, Carrier and the 130ft Lord Kitchener. The largest ferry was the Alexandra in 1913, which was a 235-tonne ship and 171ft long.

H.M.S. Atalanta.

Two hundred pounds offered by the Admiralty as a reward for any one giving definite information as to the cause or the locality of the loss of the missing training ship will be regarded by the relatives and friends of the poor fellows on hoard as an indication that there is no longer room for the slightest doubt as to the dreadful nature of the catastrophe. Even the official mind, which is slow to admit the occurrence of events prejudicial to itself, by the issue of this notice reluctantly places upon record the fact that the last gleam of hope for the safety of the ship and her precious cargo of human lives has vanished. It is now a melancholy certainty that the ship which was sent to sea by the Admiralty in the place of the Eurydice has met with a precisely similar fate — that she has been blown over and swalowed up by the pitiless waves, and that at one fell swoop has the desolation of death been carried to over three hundred homes. The country from end to end is thrilled with horror by this terrible calamity, and already the demand has gone forth that the Admiralty itself shall be placed upon its trial in order to the prevention of the recurrence of such woful mishaps. Although the reward of £250 has been offered, we much doubt whether we shall ever obtain reliable information as to the exact spot, or the time, or the method of the foundering. There is no doubt but that she went down carrying with her every trace of the accident, and whatever wreckage may be thrown up hereafter will have travelled so far in deep sea currents as to be valueless save as mementoes of the dead, The disaster is so awfully dreadful that it is impossible as yet to think or to write of it with calmness.

THE ATALANTA.

*The Brighton Gazette* of Thursday is responsible for a somewhat extraordinary statement concerning the missing training-ship Atalanta. It says : "We have special information from an authentic source that so long ago as the 4th of May a sailor of the mercantile marine, whose name is known, and who has been sometime in Newhaven and Brighton, communicated direct to the Admiralty full particulars, or at least the means of obtaining full particulars, and giving the reason why he was unable or afraid to come forward in the matter himself. This communication seems to have been ignored, and on the 12th or 13th he wrote again, saying he knew what certain parties were making out of the retention of the facts, and that he thought it wrong they should be longer withheld. This was again ignored, but the next day or so the Admiralty sent a letter for insertion in the daily papers, saying that they thought all hope of the Atalanta must now be abandoned!" The journal suggests that the offer of a reward was probably made with the view of inducing the man to come forward, but the same influence which prevented his coming forward in the first instance will probably have the same effect now. The *Gazette* concludes with a significant remark. It says : "When we add the fact, which is beyond all doubt — that during the present week certain not obscure persons, both in Brighton and London, have had in their hands a chart 'lined ' and marked with minute details of the Atalanta, at a date since any official or other information can be obtained of her, or is ever likely to be, we think we are justified in saying a very great mystery surrounds the whole matter, and that our information is special and extraordinary."

Mr. Edward H. Capper, of Cardiff, in discussing the loss of the Atalanta, calls attention to the suggestion frequently made that she may have capsized like the Eurydice. He points out that the Eurydice did not capsize, but foundered because when lying over heavily under a press of canvas she filled through her lee ports, which were open. He adds that he was never in any ship which would not have done the same.

The Secretary of the Royal Naval School, New Cross, writes : " I have the pleasure to acquaint you that at a meeting of the Council of the Royal Naval School, held at New Cross, on Tuesday, I was directed at once to ascertain the number of children of officers of ward-room rank left fatherless by this sad calamity, with a view to receiving their sons into this school on such terms as the circumstances in each case may render necessary."

In the history of lost vessels probably the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty never took so much trouble to obtain intelligence as in the case of the missing Atalanta. In prosecuting enquiries, letters have been addressed to the following maritime nations, requesting that captains of vessels should be instructed to keep a look-out for ahy trace of the missing ship: France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austro-Hungary, Greece, Chili, and the United States of America. The foregoing Powers are those who have recently combined with England in a new and important system of international ocean signalling. The ready acquiescence manifested by all the maritime governments of the earth makes it evident that there is a world-wide sympathy with England, and an anxiety to aid in ascertaining the fate of those 300 youths whose disappearance is at present involved in mystery. At the present time there must be some thousands of vessels on the watch.

THE ATALANTA DISASTER.—

The Plover, gun boat, Commander Steward, as to whose safety there were serious misgivings until intimation of her arrival at Vigo was received, reached Spithead on Wednesday morning with five ordinary seaman who belonged to the Atalanta, but who, happily for themselves, did not take passage in her when she left Bermuda. These and an ordinary seaman named Varling are all who remain of the crew, and they will, it is understood, be examined by the Court appointed to investigate the circumstances connected with the disappearance of the vessel. The men give the Atalanta a very bad character.
