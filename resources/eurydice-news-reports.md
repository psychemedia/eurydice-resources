The Eurydice, 26, building Portsmouth upon the plan laid down Admiral Elliot, will launched next month. She is constructed on the draught of the Vestal, with an increase of length and a decrease of beam, and the reduction of the angle of the floor, which will reduce her draught of water about 18 inches. This vessel is extremely clean abaft and forward, and there is no doubt she will have great velocity ; but, in all probability, she will prove very wet.

WEATHERLINESS OF THE EURYDICE.

To the Editor of the Hampshire Telegraph.

Sir, -I learn that the Eurydice draws two feet less water than is usual with ships of war of her size and tonnage. Now this fact, connected as it is with her superior capabilities on a winid, appears to me, to be as a relation of thinigs that deserves no slight consideration-one inideed that ought to be scrutinizingly looked into ; because the quiality of ships' weatherliness is taught by some ship designers to depend on the amiounit of their respective *lateral resistance*, or the quantity of immersed area of the greatest longitudinal sectton a vessel when on the wind offers to the floating medium. 



That thlis is fl very prevalent opinlion need Por: not be urged onl those wvho attend to changes made ini order to imuprove leewuardly vessels and those carrying C e b.lack helms'i for the alterationis theou effected in ttheu e are ievarliahiy in accordance wvith it, and found to con2s sist eithler in brhigrini them dowvn inl the water b~y 1V Y meesims ot' nioro ballast, givingf thletim additionial f~als'e S'i'(t keel, or gripeb or increaise of t'oretout.

The caser ot' thc Jlmnydfce, asaC contradictionl to the entire truth ot' this taught principle, in my opinionl, formis anlh i-- stance of'a very strikiiig kind, sinice we find in her tihe iipoisession ot' th~e quality ?? great wveatheiliness, (0o-0 'f loined with dimin~utipn. of later al resistance.

A letter from Lieut. Sabben, R.N. on a subject of considerable interest to naval men — namely, the cause of " weatherliness" in ships, as illustrated by that apparent in H.M.S. Eurydice, was published by our local contemporary some little time since. It msy not be irregular, if we say a few words on the subject, without going into Lieut. Sabben's theory, which would be "dry" — and therefore unpardonable. 

e doubt whether " giving additional false keel, or gripe, or increase of forefoot," be " futile contrivances," by way of making a ship more weatherly when deficient in that important quality ; — they will oot turn a bad ship into a good one, any more than s pair of spectacles will do the same for defective sight ; but that such things have something to do wilh " weatberiiness," universal experience seems to attest. We also doubt extremely the fact alluded to. concerning vessels which have the faculty of being lifted bodily to windward, and making " weather " way, instead of " leeway"; and, con- sequently, having to reckon the former instead of the latter in their calculations on a voyage. Tbat aome sailors M say " that some ships do this, proves little : we have heard it said that musket balls rise on leaving the barrel. The question of how accu- rately ships do "fetch tbe point they look up to," is very interesting in each individual case, and should be carefully tried, when, and where, no weather or lee, tide or current, lurks as a disturbing cause. Rut our concern is with Lieut. Sabben's data, the chief of which is the weatherliness of the Eurydice. 1 She has " little " (comparative) "lateral resist-] smce" ;— is that quite certain ? Does not length, I and great length of keel, give this ? and is not the Eurydice longer, considerably, " than ships of war of her size and tonnage" : ex. gr. Sir W. Symonds's 26s ? We do not presume to speak positively ; and are quite sure that Lieut. S. is well able to set us right, if we are not so ; but we should have guessed that the " lateral resistance " of Eurydice, waa at leaat equal to that 'of Vestal, for instance : a ship of tbe claas with which alone Eurydice is to be com- pared, with any fairness. Our own very clumsy notion is, that " very dif- ferent, indeed opposite arrangements of the elements ofa ship's form," may produce almost equal ex- cellence, in onr present state of knowledge of the subject be it remembered, and without saying tbat there is not one leading principle of form which may be perfect, supposing we could get at it. Now, ob- serve these trials of Eurydice and Warspite ; the formerly certainly had tbe advantage ; we never for a momcnl doubted that sbe would — at least, we always expected it. But there was a third vessel in company, dnring (we think) most of those trials— H.M. brig Grecian, built on a plan much more un- like both Warspite and Eurydice, than either of these was unlike tbe other, with the very form which Lient. S. thinks a mistaken one— namely, with ' great rise of floor" — in fact, a complete wedge ; and yet she went to windward of both ships. So that the facts are these— here were three ships, differing in model many ways, and especially as to their midship sections — one having a flat floor, tbat of an old two-decked ship ; tbe other having a sharper form, with a very deep " hollow," but still with con- siderabse fulness ; the third with what Captain Rous called a "peg-top midship section" ; and the result of tbe trials pieces tbe flattest-floored ship most to leeward ; the mezao-termine next ; and little peg- top spinning away to windward of all 1 Now we do not infer that therefore the flatter-floored a aliip is tbe lest weatberiy she is, and tbe sharper tbe more ao— tbere a hundred otber things to be thought of, and otber trials might give other result* ; but there are the facts. We are to remember that, as yet, Eurydice has had no trial with any ship of her own class, and with which she was built expressly to compete — namely, Sir W. Symonds's beautiful 265 ; but we may give it as an opinion — perhaps a worthless one — that hei model is superior to theirs. Again, we are all to recollect that there is another ship on tbe same plan as Eurydice, now of some standing and known character in the service — the corvette Modeste. This ship was for some time in company with the Rover, a corvette of precisely similar claas, but on the almost opposite plan of Sir W. Symonds. We never saw any official account of their trials, but we bad our's from the officer then commanding H.MS. Vestal, and under whose orders Rover and Modeste tben were; he had frequent opportunities of judging of these two representations of opposite systems, under a variety of circumstances. The result was that, taking one thing with another, they were very equal in excellence ; tbe superiority of Modeste, as to speed, was off tbe wind, or in smooth water ; tbat of Rover, invariably, was close-hauled, and especially wben blowing fresh. Tbat is, be it observed, just at the time wben the " mechanical action " of tbe ?? body " on the " floating medium," spoken of by Lieutenant Sabben, would come into operation. We only throw oot these facts for bis consideration, or that of any one whom they may i. tercet, without in any way meaning to dogmatise on them. All will agree with Lieut. S. that the closest attention should be paid to the position of tbe ** greatest breadth ;" for. as yet, opinions differ about it considerably. All will agree, likewise, that whatever tends to " thiow " tbe weather bow " up to windward," lias ' tbe same tendency as regards ?? the entire ship ;" it being proverbial tbat, " where tbe head is, tbe body will not be far behind," unless the ship should have tbe mishap to come in two, and its dissevered portions should start, each on its own account. Lieut. S. is of course aware that in the case of the " Symondian " ships (tbe sharpest, and we really think, taken as a wbole, the most weatherhj class of ships in existence) beiog " brought down " generally ruins them ; and the lighter tbey are tbe better. The reasons are obvious, on an examination of their form. All will concur in what be says as to the imporunce of Light draught : but on tbis we cannot now enter. With very much that Lieut. S. doubtlessly has to say, we suspect that we should agree ; and bis letter was an interesting one. What we protest against is, "ot his theory, but tbe assumption that it is proved or supported, by the recent trials of the Eurydice. Whether bis theory be correct is quite a separate question.

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

THE OPERATIONS AT THE WRECK.

The continued stormy weather during the past few days has caused but very slow work to be made with the wreck of the Eurydice. High winds, accompanied by a heavy ground swell, have frequently prevented the divers from going down to the vessel, and when they have been able to make a descent the difficulties which they have had to encounteir have been so many that very little progress has been made. On Saturday there was a strong and piercing wind blowing all day from the North, which effectually put a stop to all attempts to renew opetations. On the previous day during the height of the gale the *Dromedary*, lightship, which had anchored near the wreck to indicate the spot, was obliged to slip her cable and run for Portland. On Saturday, when the wind had moderated, one of the tugs went round and towed her back to the position she had previously occupied. On Sunday, of course, nothing was done, nor indeed was the weather at all favourable. Numbers of persons were attracted by curiosity to the shore at Ventnor and along the neighbouring beach, in hopes of seeing some traces of the wreck, but there was nothing to reward their search excepting a sight of the topmasts of the unfortunate ship. On Monday the wind hadr moderated considerably-at least it appeared so inside Portsmouth harbour-and hopes were entertained of a fair day's work being done. The Grinder and Camel, tugs, went out early in the morning, taking the three divers, with all their necessary appliances. Outside the  Isle of WVight, however, the wind blew freshly, and the tide threw many difficulties in the way. There was a considerable "swell" on, and although it was perfectly easy for boats to remain in position, it was not so with the divers whose occupation was rendered additionally precarious by the swinging about in the tide of the pieces of  severed rigging, sails, &c. A few minutes after nine o'clock in the morning, when the tide began to slacken, the divers made a descent, but the effect of the swell was such as to render their labours particularly troublesome and hazardous. They, however, remained down until 11 o'clock; and at two in the afternoon, on the tide being considered again favourable, they made further search, remaining under water until five o'clock, when operations were suspended for the night. The result of the day's work was to get up a part of the foresail, the studding-sail boom, and the fore topmast. A small skiff, about 14 feet long, was also sent up by the divers, and on reaching the surface one of the sides broke completely away from the other part of the boat. It is supposed to have been a small boat for the private use of some of the officers. Two of the ship's pinnaces' and cutters' masts, with all their gear attached, were also disengaged and sent up by the divers, but nothing was done with the boats themselves. The various things recovered from the wreck were brought into harbour in the evening by the tugs, and were landed at the Dockyard, where they will be stored with the other spars and rigging recovered last week. The Eurydice has at times rolled in the sea very much, and has risen off her starboard bilge, upon wshich she was first lying, and the swell has brought her up on to her keel. Her position has altered in one point, and she now lies with her head S.E. by S. The weather will have to be very steady indeed to enable the working party to continue their operations with anything like success. It is not considered at all likely that the masts of the Eurydice will be removed before the raising operations are proceeded with, as such a course is not at all necessary to the success of the attempt. Yesterday another attempt was made to clear away the top-hamper of the wreck, but the wind was again so boisterous that nothing could be done. The divers certainly went down, but the swvell was too great to permit of anything like successful work, and the Grinder, with the working party, returned early to Harbour.

DISCOVERY OF ANOTHER BODY.

A telegram last night states that the Dover and and Calais steamboat had picked up the body of a sailor, doubtless one of the crew of the Eurydice.

FUNERAL OF CAPTAIN FERRIER.

On Saturday afternoon the remains of Captain J. G. L. Ferrier, RE., of Bellside, Linlithgowshire, who was drowned by the sinking of the Eurydice, were interred with military honours in Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh. The burial service was read in St. John's Episcopal Church by the Bishop of Edinburgh, after which the procession went by way of Prince's-street, the Mound, and George IV. Bridge to the place of interment. The coffin, which was covered by the Union Jack, and on which were the deceased's hat and sword, with wreaths of *immortelles*, was conveyed on a gun-carriage drawn by six horses. Detachments of the 50th Regiment, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and the Royal Artillery took part in the procession. The streets along the route were crowded with spectators.

FUNERAL OF THE PETTY OFFICER AT HASLAR. 

On Monday afternoon the body of George Andrew Bennett, the Petty Officer who was picked up either dead, or in a dying condition, by the Emma schooner, was interred in the pretty little cemetery at Haslar. The bedy, it will probably be remembered, was removed from Ventnor to the Haslar Royal Naval Hospital on the day after the inquest and was kept as long as possible, in hopes of other bodies being found, so that a number of the crew might have been buried together. No additional bodies, however, have been recovered, and further delay being considered inexpedient, the interment was fixed for Monday. The day was exceedingly fine, and the sun, which shone brightly, seemed to bring into greater prominence the sad surroundings of the occasion. Soon after two o'clock detachments of seamen and petty officers from the flagship, *Duke of Wellington*, the *Asia* (flagship of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Fitzgerald A. C. Foley), and the Thunderer landed at the Haslar Jetty, and, accompanied by a firing party of Marines from the Duke of Wellington, proceeded to the dead-house, on the grade plot, outside of which several relations and friends had congregatcd. The word dead- house, as a rule, carries with it the idea of an ugly building, dark, close, and stuffy. The one at Haslar, however, is a model of its kind. It is not at all unsightly, either as regards its external or internal appearances, and is light and airy. Seats are placed in the lobby for the accommodation of mourners, and here the widow and other relatives and friends of the deceased who had come from his late home near Bognor were awaiting the arrival of the funeral party. In addition to the ordinary number of seamen told off to attend the funeral, several petty officers and seamen volunteered to attend and pay a last tribute of respect to one of their number, and it is hardly necessary to say their request was granted. One of the men who thus attended-Lawton, captain of the forecastle of the Thunderer-was an old shipmate of the deceased. After the men had been drawn up they were allowed to break off for a few moments and take a farewell look of the deceased before the coffin was finally closed. The large majority of the party availed themselves of the opportunity. The deceased was a fine, stalwart fellow-a splendid specimen of a British sailor-and was about 30 years of age. Although he had been dead more than a week there was little change perceptible, and there was no trace of suffering stamped on his features. On the contrary, his face bore a tranquil and placid expression, which it was somewhat difficult to associate with the harrowing nature of the terrible event which had such a fatal ending. A number of flowers had been tastefully arranged around the head of the dead man. The coffin was a stained deal one, studded with black nails, and the breast-plate bore the following inscription:—

R. I. P.  
GEORGE ANDREW BENNETT, P.O.,  
Captain of the Quarter-deck, H.M.S. Eurydice,  
Drowned by the capsizing of that ship off Dunnose,  
March 24th, 1878.

A Union Jack formed the pall, and the coffin was carried to the hearse by six blue-jackets. For some reason the corpse was not conveyed on a gun-carriage, as is usual in naval funerals. The cortege was headed by the firing party of marines, with arms reversed. There was no band, it being understood that the widow did not desire one. Next came the hearse, behind which followed, on foot, the widow of the deceased, his sister, brother-in-law, and a few other relatives and friends of the deceased, including two Petty Officers-Jones and Evans-from the Osborne. Then followed the detachments of the crews of the Duke of Wellington, Asia and Thunderer, numbering altogether about 170.

H. SUIT1H said: The amount of ballast in the I hadno'rpydice when she left England was thirty tons. There inside ,vqs no reason to suppose any wa8 removed abroad. The I of a angles of maximum and vanishing stability were not as- cicesi, certained. The hammocks were not made buoyant. There ais reason to believe the usual establishment of lifc-belts three was on board, viz., ten per cent. of the complement, or le the about thirty life-belts. Cork mattresses and waterproof d the sheets have been tried, and have proved unsatisfactory on various points. The men do not like them, moreover. I acon- may add that it would have been impossible to get them r easy out of the hammock nettings in time in the sudden die- h the aster which befel the ERrydice. It is the intention of the pre- Admiralty to direct a complete and searching inquiry into o the loss of the ship in the form of a court-martial upon the "a of survivors. (Hear, hear.) nine THE, PLAN FOR RAISING THE WRECK. twken, The mode intended to be adopted by the Admiralty 11 was officials for raising the wreck is to lash the Pearl and the Rinal o to the wreck by means of massive chains, The esom ?? is a screw corvette, 2187 tons, 1300 horsepower. itil 11 Stout shores, about 8ft. in length, are to be hung on the being outside ports of these vessels for lashing the outer purchase sarch, blocks, and they have been specially ballasted, so as to enable them to resist the pressure which the raising of the tin ship will throw on their top sides. At low water these day's vessels will be lashed to the wreck, one on either side, and Ig-sail as the tide rises she will be gradually lifted and drawn 4 feettoward the shore, the chains being tightened each tide. feet ot half-a-dozen of these lifts wvill probably be sutficient Ig the to bring the vessel as far up the beach as to enable the away workmen to get the pumps at work while the tide is out, ed to and in about a couple of hours it is thought that sufficient wiater can be puinped'out of the vessel to enable her to rise use with the tide and once more ride on the breast of the sea. naces' The work of preparing the two vessels for the task has been o also rapidly pushed forward. Yesterday morning one of then, was the 1re,1/, was brought alongside the Dockyard. It is in- tended that she shall be sent to the wreck to-day (Wednes- hings day). The interior of the vessel has been fitted up so as to )ur in accommodate-the men who will be engaged at the work, Dock- so that it will not be necessary for them to leave the spot s and until the completion of the operations to lift the ship. While the two ships are being got ready in the Dockyard tll' to lift the Ear qoudice and float her into harbour, expel ibuents her have been made in the Dockyard with four models oaf ves- I the els, with the purpose of deteriining the best method of ition swinging the ship. One of the methods practiced wa sung- gested by Mr. Brewver, the mate of the Carnpce dolen, coal head hulk. ;eady ' MISCELLANEOUS. their On Friday, the 1 2th, a performance will be given at the Theatre Royal, in aid of the Relief Feud, when several con- well-known aau s wil appear. On Friday evening and ill he Saturday afternoon next, perfornicisces will be given at with the Portland Hall, by the Th'Audecrer Minstrels, the pro- as of ceeds beingr devoted to the Relief Fund. With regard to the sad loss of life in the Z. Frt flce' it is eurious to note that the schooner whose crew picked up a wind few of the drowniiig men carried no brandy or stimulants lone. whatever on board. It is most strange that thone who 3 too seek their fortune upon the deep waters should not slwvays carry such necessary articles in the medicine and chest, be the captain and crew teetotallers for ever- ly to Pictorial IVorld. Sad as all the cases of bereaved parents an] other rela- tives of those on board the EIurydice are, there are some felw which arc inexpressibly so, noticeable amougst them and being that of a poor woman who lost one son in the tilor, 01pthsinl, n second through the explosion on board the T kwadercr, and now a third through the foundering of the EItrydice. The Admiralty has decided that Benjamin Cuddiford, G. A.B., and the other survivor from the lost JAs;'udice was shall be formally brought to trial by Court-Martial, in rred order that the whole circumstances of the case, as far as ;din- can be gathered from their evidence and that of the i1is-divers who have been working on the ship, shall be 'hich sifted, with the view to decide whether the ship was nod, sufficiently ballasted and properly handled.

Writing from Ventnor our correspondent says that the is a subscriptions to the .Eumrydice Relief Fund are flowing in r as rapidly, and a handsome sumn will be sent to the Ports- and mouth Committee. The large amount of 701. was collected in a few hours by the Chief Officer of the Coastguard in of the little village of St. Lawrence, and a very influential and committee has been appointed. Mr. J. G. Livesay ome (honorary secretary) is, working very earnestly in the eral matter, and his efforts are rewarded with success, the list men being headed by two subscriptions of 20 guineas each from Miss Bligh, of Torwood, and J. Snowden-Henry, Esq., and respectively. On Sunday special collections were niade in e of the various places of worship in the town in aid of the sary Fund, which were all crowded ?? congregations. The sermons generally containe some special reference to who the recent catastrophe, and very earnest and eloquent the appeals ere made for the widows and relatives of the fter crew. Especially was this the case at the Congregational oakChurch, which was crowded both morning and evening, the Rev.Mr. Davies, the pastor, being the minister who the visited the survivors, Cuddiford and Fletcher, after the irge capsizing of the frigate. On Sunday a large number of por- persons visited the neighbourhood of the wreck from all parts of the Island.

Secretary to the Ventnor hat Committee, writes to the Tiiese:-Will you allow me to the make a proposal through the ubiquitous columns of the hei~nes which, if adopted, will bring a large accession to er th fund now being raised for the widows, orphans, and cad other dependent relatives of the brav e men wh am the me, nation has so grievously lost? It is that a simultaneous the collection be made on Saturday next by employers through- out the country in their offices, shops, factories, farmyards, workshops, & c. The builders in this town have promised me that they will make such an appeal to their hands, and I am sure that it will meet with a hearty response. I be- lieve there are few working-men in the British Isles who me, would not, on such an occasion, he-rfully give a quarter or half of a day's pay, accordong as the circumstances of ied their o wn families might permit. The head of every house- the hold should ask each of hisservants for a trifle,and even ouc children may give their penny and upwards. A very erroneous im pression is abroad, even here on the scene of rty the catastrophe, as to the probable number of persons who it will require relief. Because the Es'rq7ldie was a training- ,no ship it has been assum ed th at nearly all her crew would be very young and unmarried. But she was a training-ship the for ordinary seamen, not for boys, and I have just been in- I a formed on good a uthority, that a much larger proportion ng of the crew were marriedcthanhad been supposed. Letno one be afraid of giving too much.

THE EURYDICE.

At Sandown Church, on Sunday. the Vicar, the Rev. G. S. Kerney. preached special and collections on behalf of the relatives were made, amounting to 3£50 1s. At Lake Mission Church  £3 10s. was collected.

Special sermons were preached at the Congregational Church, Ryde, and at Newport Parish Church on Sunday ; also at Portemouth, and other places.

The Lords of the Admiralty issued an order per yesterday (Tuesday) directing that a reward of £2 is to be paid for the recovery of each of the bodies of the unfortunate men lost in the Eurydice, and the whole of the funeral expenses will be borne by the Admiralty.

The weather has prevented more being done to the Eurydice during the past week.

The Mansion House fund for the relief of the sufferers now amounts to about £1,000. It bee been pointed out that the Eurydice was a training ship fur ordinary seamen, not boys.

The *Field* gives its reasons for believing that Capt. Hare was bringing his vessel up Channel with the ordinary caution of a seaman, but scarcely with a full apprehension of what might be the outcome of the squally appearance of the sky. He began in time to make snug for hauling on a wind with a freshening breeze. When he found the wind freshened faster than presaged good, he ordered sail to be shortened by furling the royals. Before this could be carried out the ship was struck by a heavy squall, and ere an attempt was made to put her before the wind she was knocked down on her side, and, her ports being open, she filled rapidly with water, and went to the bottom. Thus the Eurydice was thrown on her beam ends because she was struck by a squall, and because she was not run off the ' wind before she got the full weight of it. She heeled so rapidly to such an extreme angle because her lee ports were open, and she sank so suddenly from the same cause. Of course it has been asked if it was a prudent thing to sail with the lee ports open. As events turned out, it undoubtedly proved to be a very imprudent thing ; but no blame can be attached to Capt. Hare for this. It is customary to have the ports open under such conditions- they propably would have been closed when the vessel was braced up after clearing Dunnose ; and if the ports were never opened because a ship might under the influence of a sudden squall, put her port sills under, it would show an excess of caution equal to that of a man who bought a steam launch, but never lighted up because he was afraid the boiler might burst.

A complete and searching enquiry into the lose of the ship is to be be made in the shape of a Court Martial.

No more bodies have been recovered.

The midship section of the ship shows that the ports were just upon 6ft. above the water-line, and that the comparatively small heel of 18 deg. would bring the ports under water and prevent the vessel righting.

A correspondent of the *Devenport Independent* writes:- There are many distressing cases of bereavement and suffering here. In one a poor woman in Devonport, who lost a father, mother, and two children in 14 months, actually left the town early on Monday morning to be in Portsmouth to receive her husband, and only learnt the harrowing news on the road, when she returned a widow. In another case a young woman went round to be married to one of the young men ; she has been brought hack in such a condition, from shock sustained to the system, that her life is despaired of. A third case is that of a poor woman in Devonport, who, four months ago lost her husband in the Narcissus ; whilst her husband was in that ship she lost and buried seven children; and in the Eurydice had lost her only remaining child and her only support. A hardhearted act has oome to my knowledge concerning this poor woman. She is fortunately entitled to £17 for the back pay of her deceased husband, and on Monday she went to a certain clergyman—a curate—and asked him to sign a certificate of her marriage, in order to get the money. Notwithstanding that she explained to him the distressing circumstance in which she was paced, he demanded 2s. 6d. of her. She told him that she had not got the money, whereupon he refused his signature without the fee. The poor woman was obliged to borrow the money, which she obtained through a friend. Returning to the clergyman she *purchased* the certificate, but it was necessary for her to remind the rev. gentleman that he had to give her 6d. change to the 3s. she had tendered in payment! "And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover a multitude of sins."

A correspondent of the *Times* rises draws attention to the coincidence that a somewhat similar fate, under somewhat similar circumstances- for it was almost within sight of her destination — befel the Eurydice's ill-fated consort ship 15 years ago—the Orpheus. In classic tale Eurydice was the wife of Orpheus. The Orpheus was entering the Manukan harbour, near Auckland, on a fine Saturday afternoon in February or March, 1863. Mistaking the channel she struck on the bar, about 40 only being saved.

The brig Romulus, which weathered the storm in which the Eurydice foundered, has arrived from Wales at Dover, and her master, Capt. Stephens, reports his own observation of the squall which proved so disastrous. At the time its occurrence he was about 12 miles astern of the Eurydice, off the Isle of Wight, and noting a fall in the barometer, accompanied by an unusual outcast appearance of the sky, which seemed most threatening, ordered sail to be shortened, and the hands ready to the haulyards in case of emergency. It was not long before the storm observed on the horizon suddenly swept down with all its might upon the ship, with a roar almost deafening. At the order "Let go" from the captain, the haulyards were released, and the sheets loosened until the hurricane had moderated, and the Romulus proceeded arriving safely at 9 p.m. at Dover. Capt. Stephens was of course ignorant of the awful calamity that had happened on his path, and regrets he did not make the other side of the island, as he might have been enabled, like the Emma, to have saved some of the Eurydice's crew.

THE loss of the *Eurydice* is a national calamity. In some terrible respect the catastrophe of the *Captain* has been repeated. Both ships were caught in sudden squalls near the coast— Spain in one mum, England in the other— and both foundering, drowning nearly all on board. At the same time, as thousands of ships, great and small, are continually caught in squalls, and very few indeed founder when there is sea-room, we must suppose that the fatal result is due, as it was in the case of the *Captain*, to some radical defect in the vessel's trim. We have now lost about a thousand of our sailors from a cause which imperatively demands exhaustive analysis.— *Brief*.

The *Hornet* says:—"Eurydice is an unlucky name. One Eurydice hanged herself, another died of a serpent bite, and now a third goes to the depths in sight of the shores of the land from which she had long been absent."

"It may interest some of your readers to know that the snow-storm of the 24th of March struck the Worcester end of the Malvern-hills from the north-west at 1 p.m., as the Priory church clock struck. It took threequarters of an hour to clear this end of the range. It travelled in a south-east direction, and arrived at the supposed position of the Eurydice, off the Isle of Wight, at 4.30 p.m. Its appearance was that of a 'white wall' bulging forward. There was no haze between my position and the advancing white wall, the distance of which I judged to be two and a half or three miles. With me it was sunshine ; I had not got 100 yards on my way down the hill when the storm overtook me. It travelled at a rate of 35 miles an hour, or a mile in less than two minutes. Assuming the distance to Dunnose, as the crow flies, to be 115 miles, the rate the storm travelled would be 32.7 miles an hour. The time the rear edge took to clear Malvern was three quarters of an hour; this would give a length of cloud 24.5 miles. Any one standing near an express train going at forty miles an hour knows the current which is produced, and, therefore, cannot be surprised at the enormous pressure a compact mass of cloud 24 1/2 miles long will exert on the place over which it passes at a rate of a mile in less than two minutes. As the mass of cloud was moving from N.W. to S.E. its length has been spoken of ; what its breadth may have been must remain unknown."

THE LOSS OF THE "EURYDICE."

A-message from the Queen has been forwarded by the Admiralty to the relatives of the officers who were lost in the Eurydice, together with a letter conveying an expression of their lordships' deep regret at the sad event.

On Friday morning a pilot lugger sailed into Portsmouth, and handed over to the Commander-in- Chief a sail, a boat's awning, a bucket, several other pieces of wreckage, and four caps, two of which bore the ribband of the Eurydice, which had been picked up about 20 miles to the westward of the place where the ship went down.

On Friday the Lord Mayor received from Captain J. C. Wilson, A.D.C. of the Thunderer, a communication conveying to him, on behalf of the Portsmouth Committee, an expression of their deep sense of his kindness in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Eurydice, and gratefully accepting his offer. In the afternoon, also, Lord Charles Beresford, M.P , waited upon the Lord Mayor, and personally tendered him the thanks of the naval authorities at Portsmouth for the promptness of his assistance, which was much appreciated. The following appeal has been issued from the Mansion House on the subject: " The Lord Mayor, at the desire of the naval authorities at Portsmouth, will most gladly receive at the Mansion House donations for the support of the widows, orphans, dependents, and relatives of the crew of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, which sank off the Isle of Wight with nearly all hands on Sunday last. The loss of a gallant crew of over 300 young British sailors, within sight of home and in such distressing and appalling circumstances, has created a deep feeling of sorrow throughout the country. It has been thought that the sympathy of the public in this disaster cannot be better or more practically shown than by affording aid to those bereaved relatives whose only means of support has been cut off so suddenly and sadly. Tne Portsmouth Committee are obtaining details of the number of widows, children, aged parents, and others rendered destitute by the calamity. The Lord Mayor meanwhile appeals to his fellow citizens and the public at large for donations for the relief of these sufferers, and he hopes that the response may be such as to enable him to remit a very handsome sum to the local committee at Portsmouth, with whom he is in direct communication."

Saturday and Monday were blank days, so far as the clearing of the wreck of the Eurydice was concerned. The wind blew strongly and coldly from the north, and the dockyard tugs did not leave their moorings. During the previous day the Dromedary, which had been anchored near the scene of the wreck as a lightship, was obliged, in consequence of the violence of the weather, to slip her cables and make for Portland, where she arrived safely on Saturday morning. While the two ships are being got ready in the dockyard to lift the Eurydice and float her into harbour, experiments have been made in the yard with four models of vessels, with the purpose of determining the best method of swinging the ship. One of the methods practised was suggested by Captain Brewer, the mate of the Camperdown steamer. Captain Coppin, who succeeded in raising the Alpheta from Bembridge Ledge a few weeks ago, has also offered his services, but he has been informed that the dockyard authorities will themselves conduct the operations. The Rinaldo is not only being prepared to float the ship, but is being fitted with sleeping accommodation for the riggers and divers, to remove the necessity of their leaving the ship.

The more the matter of the foundering of the training ship is discussed the more necessary seems the holding of a naval inquiry, for the purpose of clearing up questions which were not submitted to the jury at Ventnor, and which only a court of professional and scientific experts will be able to fully appreciate. With reference, indeed, to one very important point, the jury were clearly misinformed. The boy Fletcher, from what he had heard among his mess-mates, was under the impression that the ballast of the ship was principally composed of the water which was stored below for drinking and cooking purposes, and of the usual stores of the ship. At the end of the voyage, of course, the weight of the water and stores would bo much diminished, and ; hence, had they constituted the main ballast of the Eurydice, her stability would have been greatly affected by their exhaustion. To rebut this evidence, the able seaman, Cuddiford, was recalled by the Admiralty agent, and he said that the ship had the proper amount of ballast for her tonnage, and that the lower tier of water-tanks was never disturbed. This was considered satisfactory by the jury, but it has been since discovered from drawings now in the possession of the Admiral Superintendent that the ship was not fitted with a second tier of tanks. It is not, however, believed by professional persons at Portsmouth that the reduction in the weight of water ana stores would seriously lessen the stability of the ship. The utmost difference which the loss during the voyage would make in the draught of the Eurydice would be about eight or ten inches, the only practical result of which would be to make her a little more " lively." In order to clear up the question of the amount of water in the ship at the time of foundering, Admiral Foley has instructed the divers to measure the contents of the tanks as soon as they are reached ; but as they are not water-tight, and will have been filled with sea water, it is not considered likely that their present condition will afford any guidance as to their state on Suuday, the 24th ult. The midship section of the ship also shows that the ports were just upon 6ft. above the water-line, and that the comparatively small heel of 18' would briug the ports under water aud prevent the vessel righting.

On Sunday, at Portsmouth, reference was made to the sudden calamity in most of the pulpits, and in several of the churches collections were made on behalf of the friends and relatives of the seamen.

On Saturday afternoon the remains of Captain J. G. L. Ferrier, R.E., of Bellside, Linlithgowshire, who was drowned by the sinking of the Eurydice, were interred with military honours in Greyfriars' Churchyard, Edinburgh. Detachments of the 50th Regiment, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, and the Royal Artillery took part in the procession. The streets along the route were crowded with spectators.

The remains of Lieutenaut Tabor, which, after the inquest at Ventnor, were conveyed to Cheam, Surrey, the residence of his family, were interred in Cheam Churchyard on Friday afternoon. The corpse was followed by the Rev. R S. Tabor, the father, aud the brother and sister of the deceased, Mrs Tabor, the wife of the gallant officer, being present at the church and grave. The coffin was covered by the Union Jack, a fitting pull, flowers forming a cross, and *immortelles*. The service, which was partly choral, was conducted by the rector, the Rev. C. H. Rice, assisted by several other clergymen. Despite the terrible weather, a large number of persons were present, comprising many of the resident gentry. Captain Fellowes, of the Royal Naval College, re-presented the Admiralty.

The remains of George Arthur Bennett were interred in the cemetery at Haslar, close by the spot at which the victims of the explosion on board the Thunderer were buried. The fuueral was a very quiet affair. No band attended, but a firing party of Marines, and a number of blue-jackets who had volunteered from the various ships in harbour, were present. The spectators were very few. The servioe was conducted by the Rev. Mr. Nickolby, chaplain to the hospital.

At a meeting of the Middlesex District Lodge of Good Templars, on Saturday evening, the Rev. E. Schnadhorst, district chaplain, referred to the loss of the Eurydice, and to the fact that one of the Naval Lodges belonging to the Order had gone down with the ill-fated vessel. A resolution was unanimously adopted, expressing sorrow at the foundering of the Eurydice, and the entire loss of a lodge of Good Templars working under the title of the " Decoy Bird," and sympathy with the relatives of the deceased.

In the House of Commons, on Monday, Mr. W. H. Smith, in reply to Captain Price, stated that the amount of ballast in Her Majesty's ship Eurydice when she left England was 30 tons, the amount she had always carried, and there was no reason to believe any was removed. It was the intention of the Admiralty to direct a complete enquiry into the loss of the ship.

A writer in the Field (Mr. Henry Ligg) says: " It is often remarked that history repeats itself ; unhappily, in this melancholy case it is so, for this ship is the second Her Majesty has lost from a similar cause within sight of the same spot. Her Majesty's schooner Pincher, Lieutenant T. Hope commander, sailed from Sheerness for Portsmouth on Sunday, March 4, 1838, in company with H.M.'s frigate Volage, 28 guns, Captain H. Smith. On the following Tuesday afternoon, between 4 and 5 p.m., the schooner was observed standing in for the Isle of Wight to windward of the Volage ; the weather fine, but the wind at times squally. The two ships were working towards Spithead. It is supposed, for no one is alive to tell the tale, that a squall caught the schooner, threw her on her beam-ends, and, having a press of sail set, and a heavy gun amidships, with boats, soars, &c., on deck, she never righted, and all on board, about 35 souls, were instantly drowned. It is also said that when the Vol tge missed her, she made exertions to discover where she was ; and that, it being then dark, a blue light was burnt and a gun fired to denote her position, in case any of the unfortunate people should be able to get to her ; but beyond that nothing was done, for the Volage made the best of her way to Spithead, without keeping the sea all night and at the dawn of day causing a look-out to be kept for the wreck. It is also asserted that not until the following Saturday, in consequence of the rumours prevailing of the loss of the schooner, was any inquiry or investigation made, and then a sort of gossip was held at the Port Admiral's office about her and her unfortunate crew. However, on Monday, the 12th — five days afterwards— two Cowes pilots called on the Port Admiral to state that they had seen the crutch of the mainboom of a vessel, supposed to belong to a man-of-war, floating about four miles and a half S.S. W. of the Owers light-vessel ; and the second Master Attendant of the dockyard, having been despatched early on Tuesday morniug — a week after the accident — ascertained that the wreck of the Pincher was lying in about 14 fathoms of water, on her larboard broadside, with all sails set, and her head S.W. Measures were immediately taken to weigh her, but without success, in consequence of the tempestuous state of the weather and the heavy sea on the spot, and all returned to port. After several failures, it was not until June that the officers of Portsmouth succeeded in raising her and towing her into the harbour. A coroner's inquest was held on ten of the bodies found on board, and a verdict returned, "Found dead on board the Pincher from suffocation, supposed to be caused by the over-setting of the vessel near the Owers Light." The Eurydice and the Modiste were the construction of Admiral Elliott, C.B., and were different in two important elements of safety to any other vessels of their size in our own or the French navy. Of the Modiste, the Plymouth correspondent of the *United Service Journal* writes under date 20th of October, 1838 : - I fear I should fail in the attempt if I were to endeavour to describe to you the minute peculiarities of the Modiste. It may however be remarked, in a general way, that she appears higher above the water than other ships of her class, and draws less water.' Of the Eurydice, the First Lord of the Admiralty stated in the House of Commons that the ship was 921 tons (about the same as the Modiste ; was built by Admiral Elliott ; that she carried in the place of her old 26 guns two 64-pounder guns ; that she carried the same ballast as in former commissions, and 117 tons of water as against 102 tons ; that her draught of water was 16ft. 6in. I may remark that I once owned a very fast merchant ship, of the highest class at Lloyd's, 341 tons, and she drew 16ft. 6in. when in her best sailing trim ; and that our largest cutter yacht, of 111 registered tons, draws 14ft. This small draught of water is less by about 4ft. than is usual in vessels betweeii 900 and 1000 tons, which, coupled with greater height out of water, aud the fact that both the ballasting power of the provisions and water for 300 men in a voyage across the Atlantic must have been materially reduced, are, I think, reasons why this fine ship should not recover herself when struck by so exceptionally sudden and so unusually heavy a squall, before any amount of human sharpness and skill could reduce the canvas, which was by no means in excess of what any seaman in the world, in such a ship, would carry under similar circumstances of fair wind and the fine weather that had prevailed all day until a few moments before the awful catastrophe, which the whole world will never cease to deplore."

A correspondent of the *Devonport Independent* writes : " I shall never forget the morning on which the news of the loss of the Eurydice was received in Devonport. The effect was truly awful. It seemed as if the Pagan demon Terror himself had made his appearance among the people. The hearts of men and women alike were stilled with affright and their tongues stricken dumb with pain. In such times of great calamity, and especially wheu that calamity is fearfully near us, the thoughts of most men mysteriously take a religious tone — are arrested by a deep and solemn conviction of the working of an Almighty and impenetrable Power above and beyond them. So it was with not a few persons in Devonport on Monday morning. There are many distressing cases of bereavement and suffering. In one a poor woman in Devonport, who lost a father, mother, and two children in 14 months, actually left the town eirly on Monday morning to be in Portsmouth to receive her husband, and only learnt the harrowing news on the road, when she returned a widow. In another case a young woman went round to be married to one of the young men ; she has been brought back in such a condition, from shock sustained to the system, that her life is despaired of. A third case is that of a poor woman in Devonport, who, four months ago, lost her husband in the Narcissus : whilst her husband was in that ship she lost aud buried seven children ; and in the Eurydice has lost her only remaining child and only support. A hard-hearted act has come to my knowledge concerning this poor woman. She is fortunately entitled to £17 for the back pay of her deceased husband, and on Monday she went to a certain clergyman — a curate — and asked him to sign a certificate of her marriage, in order to get the money. Notwithstanding that she explained to him the distressing circum- stances in which she was placed, he demanded 2s. 6d. of her. She told him that she had not got the money, whereupon he refused his signature without the fee. The poor woman was obliged to borrow the money, which she obtained through a friend. Returning to the clergymen she *purchased* the certificate, but it was necessary for her to remind the rev. gentleman that he had to give her 6d. change to the 3s. she had tendered in payment ! ' And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.'  I am glad to learn, and the public will be equally so, that immediately after the catastrophe Mr. Metham resoived to mitigate its grievous effects by opening to at least some of the bereaved f amilies the orphan refuge of the magnificent institution over which he presides, of which he is the very life and soul, and which is one of the finest testimonies to a loving sympathy and to a broad-hearted chariy that any nation ever possessed. An election of orphan girls to the Royal Female Orphan Asylum takes place in a week or two hence, but a special effort will be made to meet this exceptional and bitter trouble. Well done ! The crown of charity is the richest and brightest crown of all: charity to the orphan is the most Divinely blessed charity of all."

Mr. J. G. Livesay, writing to the *Times* from Ventnor, says : " Will you allow me to make a proposal through the ubiquitous columns of the Times, which, if adopted, will bring a large accession to the fund now being raised for the widows, orphans, and other dependent relatives of the brave men whom the nation has so grievously lost? It is that a simultaneous collection be made on Saturday next by employers throughout the country in their offices, shops, factories, farmyards, workshops, etc. The builders in this town have promised me that they will make such an appeal to their hands, and I am sure that it will meet with a hearty response. I believe there are few working men in the British Isles who would not on such an occasion cheerfully give a quarter or half of a day's pay, according as the circumstances of their own families might permit. The head of every household should ask each of his servants for a trifle, and even our cliildren may give their penny and upwards. A very erroneous impression is abroad, even here on the scene of the catastrophe, as to the probable number of persons who will require relief. Because the Eurydice was a training ship it has been assumed that nearly all her crew would be very young and unmarried But she was a training ship for ordinary seamen, not boys, and I have just been informed on good authority that a much larger proportion of the crew were married than had been supposed. Let no one be afraid of giving too much. Even if there should be a surplus after providing for the present sufferers, it might form a valuable reserve fund for similar cases in the future, just as the large surplus of the Hartley Colliery Explosion Fund has proved so useful for other contingencies of its kind."

A correspondent to the *Globe* writes : " The loss of the Eurydice has called attentiou to a matter of no little importance, affecting as it does the welfare of seamen. It appears that the master of the Emma the schooner which rescued the five survivors of the sunken vessel, when he got the men on board, could not apply the usual restoratives because his was what is known as a 'temperance craft.' That is to say, the Emma did not carry any stimulants for her crew, and, what is still more serious, the medicine chest contained neither brandy nor any kind of spirits. From these facts it appears urgently necessary for the Board of Trade to take immediate steps to prevent such omissions in future ; for, however desirable it may be to keep a crew sober, the indio- syncracies of the master of a vessel should not be allowed unnecessarily to imperil the lives of his crew, or of any one. In the present instance, if some brandy could have been procured on board the Emma, it is probable that the lives of more than two out of the five persons rescued from the Eurydice might have been saved. It will surprise many peo- ple to learn that from a mistaken notion of the necessity of protesting against alcohol drinking in any form the masters of some of our merchant vessels aro seriously endangering human life. A delay of half an hour, as in the present case, may, and probably will, cause death after such exposure as the five survivors of the Eurydice had experienced. Under the circumstances every one, whether a total abstainer or not, must lament this sad example of too much temperance."

Another correspondent to the *Globe* writes : "It seems a strange coincidence in naval nomenclature that both the Orpheus and the Eurydice, almost in sight of port, under full sail on a Sunday afternoon, should have been wrecked with a loss of almost all hands on board. I do not for a moment imagine that either of these melancholy events has any direct reference to the other, but the connection in name aud the similarity of many circumstances attending their fate strikes me as being at least passing strange. H.M.S. Orpheus was lost at Manakau Head, outside the harbour at Auckland, on Saturday, February 7, 1863.

The following extract from " Hollinshed's Chronicles" may be of interest: " *The Loss of the Mary Rose.* — .. . After this, 18 Julie, 1545, the Admirall of France, Monsieur Danabutte, hoised up sailes, and with his whole navie came forth into the seas, and arrived on the coast of Sussex before bright Hampstead, and set certaine of his soldiers on land to burne and spoile the countrie. . . . Immediatelie hereupon they made to the point of the Ile of Wight, called Saint Helens Point, and there in good order upon their arrivall they cast anchor and dailie sent sixteen of their gallice to the verie haven of Portesmouth. . . . The twentieth of Julie the whole navie of the Englishmen made out, and purposed to set on the Frenchmen, but in setting forward, through too much folly, one of the King's ships, called the Mary Rose, was drowned in the midst of the haven, by reason that she was overladen with ordinance, and had the ports left open, which were verie low, and the great artillerie unbreached, so that when the ship should turne, the water entered, and suddenly she suncke. In her was Sir George Garew, Knight, and foure hundred soldiers under his guiding. There escaped not past fortie persons of the whole number."

The Eurydice

So far as we have been able to ascertain — and sounding very, very many, we have not met with a contrary opinion – Islanders are anything but satisfied with the verdict of the Ventnor Jury. Of course they agree with the former portion – that the unfortunate met met with their death by capsizing of the vessel during a squall; but they differ as to the latter– that no blame attaches to anyone aboard. – The boy Fletcher proven to have been the nearest to the truth after all – though Cuddeford was recalled by the Admiralty law agent of Portsmouth to rebut his words– in saying that the ballast of the ill-fated vessel wa her water and stores (both for use), and these lessened on the voyage. Cuddeford said the lower tier of tanks were never touched, but the fact is there was no lower tier ! and the crew using from the only tanks below lightened the ship. However, this ballast question to our mind is not the most serious one. We believe most persons are firmly of opinion that the ports ought not to have been open, and that so much sail ought not to have been carried, under the circumstances. The ports being only 6ft. above water it will be seen that a comparatively slight heel over -18 degrees only— would bring them under water. Of course they should be open in fine weather and when there is no probability of bad weather— but in this case there was more than a probablility of bad weather- no-one could tell *how* bad, and wisdom and ordinary caution must have dictated their closing. The port question is a more serious one than that of water ballast, but a more important one still is the question of sail. Old, experienced seamen at Ventnor, remarked to one another as the Eurydice passed that she was carrying too much sail and would have to shorten directly— *they* could see that something bad was coming, and this most have been seen by the officers, *before* they came to the Culver shield, which has been made to shield them. We had newspaper warning that a storm might be expected on or about this day— we de not know whether this intimation was conveyed to the officers by signal or not, but we do know that the barometer had fallen rapidly, indicating something sudden and sharp, and we do know that another warning was given in the clouds some time before the storm broke on the vessel– before she passed Ventnor and came to the "shield."— There was no doubt an intense desire to get home— to the home within sight, and, being so close home, the dangers of the sea might *seem* to have been passed. " Fly on my boys, she'll stand it" would seem to have been the mental utterance— and there might have been a race on for a bet between this and a certain other vessel, when one would strain a point and run a risk, thought not certainly and knowingly run over risk to death. We give what the opinion at Ventnor was as she passed, and we must think that ordinary prudence and caution would have said–  never mind a few minutes, never mind a £5O bet (supposing this to have been lain) the barometer has fallen and the sky is threatening— one doesn't know *how much* these portend— it be be safer to close the ports and take in some little of the extra sail. The ports were not closed, and it was not attempted to reef till the full force of the squall was upon them and it was too late. It occurs to us that the fact of the ports being open may have been for the  nonce *forgotten*, with thoughts of home, and so on, and a belief the sail would "stand the storm" enabling them to anchor "by and by". No doubt sail ought to have been taken in and ports closed half-an-hour or an hour before, but we believe that had the ports only been closed, and had the vessel continued to carry her every stitch she would have righted, for according to Cuddeford she encountered a far heavier gale in the Bay of Biscay, and was "lively." As we say a comparatively slight list brought the ports under water, and then tons of water pouring in were auxiliaries to the squall, and the tin effected their terribly fatal work. The captain d the "Emma " did not shorten sail till the squall was on him, but he had *no ports open*, and had not been  carrying so much canvas. We believe the Eurydice would never have gone down had the warning of Providence and science been heeded. We class the calamity as a *preventible* one, and should write more strongly on the matter but for the words *"De mortuis nil nisi bonum."* Still, when we find one after another of our ships going down— may not the ships but about a thousand of our men– supposed to be commended by the cream of seamen— when we lose these at times when other seamen clse by are not lost, the interests of the country and of the relatives of our naval men demand that the press shall speak out and insist that the matter be not only fully enquired into, but that stringent orders be given that the officers shall run no risks, that ships shall be late, and that orders shall be disobeyed even rather than this losing game shall no longer continue. There is something radically wrong in our recent losses of ships and men. Whether naval men have become steamship hands and ceased to be *sailors* we cannot say, but certainly the matter demands the most minute enquiry, and more than that. Let us conclude with two quotations :

*Weekly Times.*– We fain would take a favourable view of the case. We are sure there will be a strict investigation into the catastrophe. This is due for the honour of the dead, as well as for the safety of our seamen afloat. We know how it came to pass that the *Captain* sank in the Bay_of Biscay; a poet has told us how the brave Kempenfelt, in the *Royal George*, "went down with twice four hundred mem." Did the *Eurydice* thus sink without any warning, or though the neglect of reasonable foresight? Did the barometer give no warnings, or were its warnings neglected because the ship was so near home?

*Vanity Fair*— We protest most emphatically against the qusetioes arising out of this catastrophe being treated as though it were a matter concerning only the reputation of the poor fellows who have gone down. The question is not that, but a far more grave and serious one— namely, whether the vessels in the Queen's service are to be handled in a prudent and seamanlike manner. We are convinced that the *Eurydice* was not so handled ; and to say that she was, in order to screen the memory the dead, or to spare the susceptibilities of the living, would be to give a public encouragement to carelessness and lubberliness not only in the Navy but in all other cases, and that at a time when those very defects are most seriously on the increase and likely to bring about disasters of greatly increased gravity.

THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

The Secretary of the Admiralty publishes tbe following copy of a memorandum received from the British steamship Badger, with regard to the state of the weather at the time of the loss of H.M.S. Eurydice, ou the 24th ult. : " London and Edinburgn Shipping Compauy, Bordeaux, Maich 28, 1878. Steamship Badger. — Sunday, March 24th,1878, about 3.30 p.m., St. Catherine's Point, about N.N. W. five miles, passed one of H.M. ships on our port side. She was then under ail sail, topmast and lower studding sails on the port side, the wind being about W. by N., fresh breeze and fine weather. The weather had been fine all day ; wind westerly, shifting from W.S.W. to W.N.W. Passed St. Catherine's Point N.N.E. two miles, at 3.45 p.m. Then observed dark, heavy clouds to the north-west. About 4 p.m. the wind shifted suddenly to N. N. W., blowing strong, with snow, and continued about half-an-hour. I believe that the appearace of a squall coming on couid not be seen from Her Majesty's ship. I did not see it until clear of  St. Catherine's Point. It was low down, and clear over head, and also clear over Isle of Wight. Therefore Her Majesty's ship would get the squall without any warning. — (signed) -Jno. Louttit."

The *Globe* points out that this statement goes some way to lessen the responsibility of those on board the Eurydice for the loss of that vessel in comparatively fine weather. Two facts of importance are now in evidence. First, that, owing to the high land on the weather quarter of the Eurydice, the squall could not well have been seen from the deck of the fine old frigate until it was fairly upon her. In the second place, the surmise that there must have been a sudden change of wind is now corroborated, the master of the Badger staring that it shifted just about 4 o'clock from west by north to north-west. This change must have nearly or quite taken the ill-fated vessel aback, thus creating considerable confusion at the very moment when it had become supremely necessary to furl sail with the utmost expedition. So far, then, this new evidence tends towards the exoneration of Capt. Hare, but it still remains to be explained how he came not only to carry a heavy press of canvas, but to keep his lee ports open, when the barometer had been distinctly indicating bad weather for many previous hours. The record of the Badger says "the weather had been fine all day, wind unsteady," a state of things which, in conjunction with barometrical j warning's, might have been expected to inspire some caution about carrying on. Ihere is one discrepancy, however, between what was observed from the deck of the merchant steamer and what Cuddiford saw before the squall broke. Capt. Louttit deposed that "it was clear over head and also over the Isle of Wight ; " whilst Cuddiford gave it in evidence "that he saw a dark cloud coming over the land." This, however, was only at the last moment, a few seconds before the squall burst on the Eurydice ; and it does not, therefore, refute the suggestion made by Capt. Louttit that the gust struck the training ship withoat warning.

On Saturday the Camel, tug, proceeded out of harbour, and cruised about the Eurydice looking for bodies or wreckage, but returned into harbour without having found anything. On Sunday a violent gale blew from the eastward, compelling the Dromedary, lighter, to slip her anchors aud go out to sea, but when the wina abated she was able to return and succeeded in recovering her moorings. On Monday there was a stiff breeze from the south-east, which prevented the executioun of arrangements made for the towing of the Pearl to her position near the wreck. During the day several articles of clothing belonging to the crew washed ashore, and a number of sailors' serges, like those worn in the Royal Navy, were found floating at sea or were washed on the rock, all bearing names, amongst them being those of W. French, J. Keily, and H. Scull. A ship chest was likewise washed ashore between Luccombe and Shanklin, and was handed over to the authorities. As the clothes-lockers were used as mess seats on the lower deck, it is thought that this indicates some motion below, but, on the other hand, it is stated that the covers of the lockers were loosely attached, and would readily float open.

Alluding to the period that bas elapsed since the unfortunate vessel went down, the *Times* says; " Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed at the small progress which is made with the raising of the ship, and many naval men say that if the chain Cables were hauled the ship would be sufficiently lifted to enable a couple of tugs to drag her into shallow water, when the ports could be closed aud the water pumped out."

The *Army and Navy Gazette*  says: " Since the loss of the Eurydice the papers have been full of letters from correspondents telling their experience when : caught in a squall, and others advising the Admiralty as to the training of seamen. One states— though where he could obtain the information from is curious — that no more thau 15 per cent. of our sailors can swim. As far as the seaman class is concerned, this would appear to be erroneous, for in all the training ships there are swimming instructors and the boys are taken to the bathing vessels fitted on purpose to give every facility for learning the art of swimming and to ensure the saiety of the learners. Their lordships have not been unmindful of the advisability of having every boy taught to take care of himself if he gets out of his elememt, and the assertion of one correspondent that sailors thought it beneath their dignity to swim, as a horse soldier might object to walking is absurd. To be as much at home in the water as on his legs is a qualification by no means despised by the sailor, and he receives the admiration of his fellows for his skill as a swimmer and diver. What else but the keen competition and love of out-doing each other would otherwise tempt men to dive from the heights they not unfrequently do."

A correspondent of the *Whitehall Review* says: "I hear that the widuo of poor Captain Hare first heard of her sad loss when making the railway journey from the North to Portsmouth, whither she was hastening to meet her husband. Some people in the same carriage were expressing their regret at the loss of the Eurydice, of which they had just read in the papers, and thus the tidings of her terrible bereavement reached the ears of Mrs. Hare. She had every hope that her husband was saved, as the accident happened so near the land, and Capt. Hare was an excellent swimmer. Unhappily, however, that hope proved vain, aod it is clear that only men of exceptional constitutions could have stood the fearful effects of immersion for an hour or more in such bitter weather as set in with that terrible squall."

The *Geographical Magazine* for April pays the following tribute to the memory of one of the gallant seamen lost in the Eurydice: "We have to record the death of one of the gallant few which attained the highest Northern latitude ever reached by man, on the memorable 12th of May, 1876. Daniel Harley was born at Madras in 1849, he entered the Navy before the mast, was a seaman gunner, served in the Ashantee War, and was one of Commodore Commerell's gig crew when he was wounded. In May, 1875, he was selected for the Arctic Expedition, and became captain of the foretop of H.M.S. Alert. He was away autumn travelling from September 11th to 14th, and suffered severely from the gale of wind and intense cold. But he soon recovered, and was full of zeal for the spring travelling, when he formed one of Capt. Markham's sledge crew, in the northern division. Harley was one of the ten who planted the Union Jack in 83 degrees, 200 min. 26 sec/ Attacked by scurvy, he still continued to struggle against the insidious disease, resolute to do his duty until he dropped. When unable to drag, he refused to be put on the sledge, and managed to walk over the ground. Out of all that heroic band, none displayed higher qualities than poor Harley. On his return to England, he joined the Eurydice, as a first-class petty officer, and was drowned when that ill-fated vessel went down off the Isle of Wight, on March 24th, 1878. Daniel Harley was a fine specimen of a British seaman. He was married shortly before he sailed for the Arctic regions."

An idea of the cases im the three towns (ssys the *Western Morning News* may afford an illustration of what are likely to be the necessities of the fund generally. A personal visit to the majority of the cases has afforded some insight into the degree of loss sustained by those who were the most closely connected with the poor men who met death by this melancholy occurrence. The ship being a training frigate, the majority of the men were, as was to be expected, only 19 or 20 years of age, and it may perhaps be safe to take the Plymouth list as representing the general proportion of married to unmarried men. Three out of the 17 or 18 men who allotted their half-pay to relatives here were married ; but neither of them leaves a large family. The case of the widow of one of them is, however, peculiarly sad. She has experienced that  
"When sorrows come  
They come not single spies, but in battalions."  
Her father, her mother, and her child, and now, to fill up the cup of grief, her husband, have all been taken avay from her within a twelvemonth. One poor woman is just expecting a child, who will never have heard its father's voice. The other cases are nearly all those in which mothers have lost sons on whom they more or less depended. In one or two instances the bereavement is very hard. One poor woman, in particular, laments an only son, who was, as she puts it, " the only real help she had in the world," and whose half-pay it is very difficult to dispense with. Other cases there are in which one of two sons — jointly their mother's stay — has been taken. In every instance the loss is irreparable; the husbaud, the supporter and protector of his wife now made lonely ; the son, the help and hope of the mother now rendered desolate, feels — and, from personal knowledge in this case, we know feels keenly — the small compensation any sum of money can buy. But, hard as it is, that is the only compensation they can receive, and that should certainly be rendered willingly and freely.

The Rev. W. H. Redknapp, incumbent of St James's, Ryde, and hon. chaplain of the Missions to Seamen, sends the following extract from the journal of the missionary to seamen, which is under his superintendence, relative to the last moments of one of the officers who perished in the Eurydice: "March 25. I found that on boarding the Emma that the captain was gone on shore about the loss of the Eurydice. The mate related, with tears in his eyes, the sad sight which he witnessed yesterday afternoon. He said, ' I took the young officer up in my arms and as I was carrying him to the cabin the poor young fellow put his arms round my neck, and his face against mine, and I could not help giving him a kiss. I thought it was the last he would ever have. I wished he had lived. I tried very hard to revive him, but all my efforts failed.' "

The following lines (signed "F. G.") on the loss  of the Eurydice, appears in the *Baily's Magazine* for this month :

'Twas on a bright and breezy day  
A noble ship came sailing home,  
Dashing from either bow the spray,
And ploughs up the milk white foam.

For the last time the gallant band,  
Close to "Old England on the lee,"  
Had said their prayers for those on land  
Who asked God's aid for those at sea.

The sun is sinking towards the west,  
Tinging with gold the belying sail;
The sailors take their Sabbath rest,  
And laugh and tell the oft-told tale.

The sister's joy, the mother's bliss,  
The dream of meeting of old friends,  
Of tight grasped hand, of lover's kiss,  
For all their hard-ships make amends.

No cheery-hearted coastguard fails  
To point the ship to those who stand  
Around– whose prayers are in the sails  
Which waft her towards the friendly strand.

No wonder that the captain thought  
With honest hope and pride of soul,
To bring the good ship, "smart and taut,"  
Like a swifr racehorse to the goal.

Mid life and hope the thick black clouds  
Snow-filled that put the ship from view;
The fierce tornado strikes her shrouds,  
She's gone ! with all her home-bound crew.

The blood-red sun comes brightly back  
And lightens up the evening sky,  
And  paints what *was* the vessel's track,  
As if in empty mockery

Alas ! for skill of human mind!  
He from whom good and evil come,
Who rides upon the stormy wind,  
Took the three hundred wanderers Home.

Poetry - H.M.S. "EURYDICE," MARCH 24, 1878.

"Eurydice," twice-told, ill-fated name,  
The fullest agony of grief to claim.  
A bride beloved upon her marriage day  
Snatched ruthlessly by death's stern hand away.  
Not her adoring lover's destined bliss  
Was nearer consummation than was this  
Two oceans passed, and close at home once more  
Gazed at in rapture from old England's shore,  
With all sails set, beneath a sunny sky,  
Wind and tide favouring. What bliss is nigh !  
Nay it is well-nigh grasped, that " Welcome Home,"  
When the proud ship plunged into the tomb,  
As on the beauty of her out-spread wings  
The fatal blast in frenzied fury springs,  
Without a warning all those noble, brave  
Young throbbing hearts are silenced 'neath the wave  
Without a warning o'er the calm bright sea,  
A message called them to eternity.  
Nor Orpheus' self for his Eurydice  
Knew the wide sorrow that felt for thee.  
How many lives what love as true and strong,  
Will to their close the grief for thee prolong ?  
If Orpheus-like we fain would search the deep  
For thy dear treasures that -within it sleep,  
No power of wealth or talent can attain  
To bring the warm life gushing back again ;  
'Twould be a cold and shadowy ghost alone  
That could not for lost love and hope atone.  
But oh ! begone, ye mystic shadows dim,  
Let holier, brighter faith now point to Him !  
Sleep, loved ones; "Sleep in Jesus;" may you rest  
Till " the sea yields her dead," then fully blest,  
May you, with Him, dwell through eternity  
In that good land where shall be no more sea,  
No tears, no partings, on that blissful shore,  
Where gallant ship shall pass by nevermore.

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

A meeting of the Portsmouth General Committee of the Eurydice Relief Fund was held at the College on Monday afternoon. The Commander-in-Chief (Admiral Fanshawe, C.B>) who presided, moved, the ex-Mayor (Mr W. Pink) seconded, and it was resolved : "That this committee, while recognising the expediency of collecting funds for those rendered destitute by the foundering of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice through several agencies as likely to enrol the largest number of subscribers, are of one opinion, that it is desirable, with a view to the efficient administration of the funds collected, that the whole should be distributed through one agency ; and that the machinery of the Patriotic Fund, so enlarged in 1875, for such objects by a Royal Commission, offer the best means for the purpose. That this committee accordingly intends to apply to the Royal Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund to receive the sums collected to be administered by the Royal Commissioners, uuder the schema adopted for the Captain Fund, excepting such sum, as they mihht find absolutely necessary to give for urgent and immediate relief." It was further determined : "That the Secretary be deputed to place himself in communication with the London Eurydice Relief Committee presided over by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, with a view to the joint intentions of the two committees being carried out."

A correspondent to Thursday's *Telegraph*, writes : -—What has been done at the wreck ? is the question heard heard on all sides, and it was past 8 o'clock on Wednesday evening before any information was forthcoming, and then it was of the most unsatisfactory kind. The return of the three tugs and the lighters boded no good, and I regret to have to announce that everything will have to be commenced *de novo*. Without venturing to say who is to blame, there seems to be too much reason to fear that "some one has blundered." The under-swell, it is said, has increased, and the tide runs with so much greater force that the anchors in use would not hold. Others of stouter calibre will have to be taken out, as the joining of the chain cables proved abortive, they were removed. But a flexible steel hawser having been swept under the wreck on Tuesday, it was expected that on Wednesday a second hawser would have been lowered into position, and that on Thursday the raising of the ship would be commenced. This, however, cannot be done, for it was deemed advisable to lift the hawser, and it has been brought into harbour. What will be the next move I cannot pretend to say, for confusion seems to prevail. Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, Controller of the Navy, who has appeared upon the scene, may be able to produce order. Om Wednesday a life pinnace was picked up some 20 miles S.W. of St. Catherine, and is supposed to have formed part of the equipment of the Eurydice. She was brought into harbour, and handed over to the Admiralty authorities. There is now in the private dock at Portsmouth an iron vessel of some 1,200 tons, which, after having broken her back, was got off Bembridge Ledge by Capt. Coffin, who, in the course of the coming summer, will try to lift the Vanguard. It is said that Capt. Coppin offered to lift the Eurydice, but that his services were declined with thanks.

The Secretary to the Admiralty forwards a further list (received by telegraph from the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the North-American Station) of men who were discharged from and to her Majesty's ship Eurydice before she left the West Indies for England viz. : Discharged from Eurydice to Rover - Walter Swindell, able seaman. Discharged to Eurydice from Rover- Charles Nicholson, captain of foretop ;  James T Devine , ordinary seaman; and Robert Hiscutt, engineer's cook.

Battalion Drill - Scene and Thoughts at Nunwell

...

Perhaps we never enjoyed the outlook more than we did on Monday, but to reverse the "silver lining to the cloud," a dark cloud now marred this goden view, when we turned eastward. ws saw some seven Government tugs and barges hovering round the spot (as it were almost beneath us, and within shot reach) when sank the ill-fated Eurydice, which now temporarily coffins a hundred or more gallant sailor boy bodies soon to be exhumed from the water and interred in the land. That is a ghastly picture that even away from the spot we care not to let our imagination turn to – made more ghastly by our belief that had the Steam Salvage Company been entrusted with the work of raising the ship, she would have been in a Portsmouth dock long ago, and her cargo of decomposing corpses consigned to their last resting place. We cannot but think that so much incompetency has been manifested by the dockyard authorities, as was manifested by those on board the ship when she sank. However, we must turn from the ship and view the Volunteers.

To the Editor of the hie of Wight Observer.

Sir.— I think it would have been but bare justice to Mr. Wiltshire, who was deputed to collect money for the Eurydice Fund, had his name appeared, as having been selected for that office, in the paragraph heading the list of subscriptions published in your last issue. It appears to me that this was the least recognition that could be made of his untiring exertions in this charitable work ; a recognition which the public would certainly not have grudged him. Trusting to your courtesy to allow these few lines to appear in your widely circulated journal, and enclosing my card,

I am, Sir, yours faithfully,

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

Operations at the wreck of the Eurydice were resumed on Monday amid  considerable difficulties, the Government arrangements having been unsuccessful. The plan whicn had been adhered to for about a month has been abandoned, and three private divers, Messrs. F. Davies, A. Sutherland, and Whittaker. ol the firm of Messrs. Sielee and German, the submarine engineers of London, have been retained. Four tugs, the Grinder, Manly aud Camel appeared on the scene during the day. An attempt was made to descend to the wreck early in the day, but the tide ran so strongly that it was impossible to do so with safety. The divers managed to reach the vessel during the slack tide in the afternoon, and examined her bows and head gear. The new plan is to sweep the ship with two steel hawsers and then to lift and carry her between two lighters to the beach.

The Portsmouth correspondent of the *Telegraph* writing on the 25th inst., says: At the wreck of the Eurydice to-day the divers were enabled to make a descent and even walk almost round the ship. The hawsers were got in position ready for slinging the vessel, and if circumstances continue as favourable as they are now, the attempt to raise her will be made to-morrow [this day, Friday].

Lord Henry Lennox writes to say, regarding the Eurydice fund, that, as far as is at present known, there are between 40 and 50 widows, 170 parents, and from 60 to 70 other relatives who were partly, and in many cases mainly, dependent upon those who have perished, and have therefore claims on the fund. It is calculated that £20,000 will be required in order to administer a minimum relief to all the sufferers. Of this sum about one half has been collected by the committee presided over by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, by the Lord Mayor's committee, and by Admiral Fanshawe's committee at Portsmouth. In order to obtain the amount still necessary, Lord Henry makes a further earnest appeal to the public. The Commissioners of the Royal Patriotic Fund have undertaken the distribution of the money, in accordance with chthea powers conferred upon them by a Royal Commission in 1875.

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

On Wednesday the Admiralty te leg raphed to the officials at Portsmouth Dockyard to the effect that their for ships having observed the increasing disnutiafaction felt by the public, as expressed in the public journals and shared in by themselves, nt the want of success of the operations fur raining the Eurydice, which bad now been sunk since the 24th March, they had instructed the thief-Constructor and the Muster Attendant of Chatham yard (Mr. Baumdors and Capt. Batt) to proceed to Portsmouth, and in consultation with the Chief-Constructor and the Master Attendant of Portsmouth Dockyard, to devise the best means for attaining the object in view as early as possible. Mr. W. B. Robinson, Chief-Constructor at Portsmouth, and Mr. J. C. Froyne, Constructor, proceeded to the wreck on Wednesday to ascertain the character of the operations which have been employed, Ac. A hawser was fastened to the Eurydice's mainmast. and carried to the Malta, which got up full speed. The wreck, however, nnnained itutuovnble. The sweeping of the ie.-el the two 7in. steel hawsers was recommenced, each hawser being capable of sustaining a strain of about 130 tons. On Thursday the two hawsers were fixed in position, round the ship, and on Friday morning the lighters were lashed down to the wreck. The Chatham officials arrived this morning. Directly the tido commenced rising the authorities assembled on the tug arrived at the conclusion that the services of the Pearl and the Rinaldo, supplemented by two mooring lighters, should be brought into requisition, the opinion being entertained that the wreck had to a certain extent become embedded in sand. By Monday it was confidently expected that the wreck would be released from her present meeting. When once she has come away from the bottom, her being floated will almost entirely depend upon the tides, it being expected that each successive tide will enable her to betaken into shore souse 200 yards. When brought above high water mark in Bay she will be pumped out, have her ports closed, and be then ready to float with the rise of the tide. On Saturday the Rinaldo, the Pearl, corvette, and the lighters and tugs were all at hand, the hawsers were made taut, and ono of the two " toggles " which it was determined to plaoo in the pOrts, with hawsers attached, and the ends carried on board lighters, was got into petition. The required rise is 10 feet to 13 feet. it was found that the vested is embedded two feet, and that there is a silting of live feet on the starboard bilge. It was confidently anticipated that the lifting would be accomplished in the course of the next few days. Upwards of a hundred coffins are in readiness to be sent out to receive the bodies found on beard, but whether these will be sufficient cannot of course be known until the divers have penetrated below, which they have not yet been able to do. On Sunday morning she was moved and pat on even keel, and Mrs all thought the end near at haul, but unhappily one of the 7in. steel hawsers gave way; also one of the auxiliaries, so that the work of lifting had to be postponed. It was thought that the two steel hawsers were fully equal to the strain, but on the turn of the tide, the Pearl. on swinging. caused such a tremendous strain on the hawser that it parted. The Rinaldo afterwards let go the hawser attached to her. The weight proved much heavier than expected—up to 300 tons. The Loudon divers have left the scene of the wreck, as some days must elapse before stouter hawsers can be placed in position and the work resented. The divers have found that the ship is much heavier than was supposed being weighted with sand, and bedd nea rly nine feet, the starboard bilge sills being about level with the ground. The officials have determined to supplement the Pearl and Rinaldo with toggles to be placed in the ports of the Eurydice, attached to lighters, four on either side, and to use eight-inch jewel chains. The operations will be resumed when the tide

THE EURYDICE.

Though the result of the operations around the Eurydice on Sunday has produced great disappointment at Portsmouth, now that the officers are in possession of the exact state of the case with which they have to deal, they are, if anything, oven more hopeful than before of being able to raise the unfortunate ship. They are, however, fully cognizant of the increased difficulty of the task before them, and measures are being promptly taken to meet it, though, as the present tides will not serve, seeing that a rise of 13ft. will be required to pull the ship out of its bed, a fortnight will probably elapse before the operation of lifting can be renewed. In the meantime, it is necessary that an ample margin should be allowed for that at present unknown quantity, the dead weight of the ship *plus* the strain which will be needed to overcome the suction between the ship and the burrow which she has formed for herself in the sand. Preparations are being made to resist a strain of some 700 tons. This is more than double the estimated dead-weight of the ship in her normal state, before the saturation of her planks and timbers and the introduction of sand into her hold through the main deck lee ports,which, as already stated, are on a level with the ground. It will also be necessary to provide against unequal distribution of strains, for it is evident that where a heavy weight has to be grappled with from purchases suspended from a moving surface or platform, great care is required so to adjust them as to prevent one hawser feeling the pinch in advance of the rest, and thus being subjected to abnormal tension. After a consultation between the Portsmouth and Chatham dockyard officers, it has been decided to supplement the buoyant power of the Pearl and the Rinaldo by dropping "toggles" through the whole of the ports of the Eurydice and attaching them to lighters placed four on each side, whereby, it is thought, the ship will be lifted evenly and bodily out of her bed. It has also been deoraed expedient to put more ballast into the Pearl and the Rinaldo in order that they may be brought down nearer to their load line, and thus acquire a firmer grasp of the water. The Rinaldo has already been brought from the scene of the wreck into harbour to receive the additional ballast on board. Eight-inch jewel chains will also probably be used, as, while steel hawsers will resist enormous vertical or horizontal strains, the unfortunate experience of Sunday proved that they are exceedingly liable to part where a nip occurs. But the most important additional factor which will be imported into the operations is the famous Popoff air-bag, which was experimentally tested at Portsmouth in 1875 with reference to its applicability to raise the Vanguard, and which was subsequently put to practical use to assist in raising the Oberon, torpedo ship, from the shoal at the mouth of the harbour. The bag, which is a combination of cordage, canvas, and vulcanized rubber, measures 22ft. in length and 12ft. in breadth and when inflated to its full extent resembles a cylindrical boiler. The total displacement of the bag is about 6O tons, and when introduced through the hatches of the Eurydice, it will be able to lift to that amount minus its own weight of 47cwt. 2qrs 14lbs. Owing to the gale which prevailed, nothing was done on Monday at the wreck. Indeed, it was found necessary to bring the lighters in, one or two- of them running great risk of being lost. Two additional divers have been brought from Devonport to assist in the preliminary operations.

Ventnor. Concert at Ventnor in aid of the Eurydice Distres Fund.

A very excellent entertainment was given last Friday afternoon in the fine coffee room of the Royal Hotel, kindly lent by Mr. Mason, in aid of the Eurydice Distress Fund. We regret to have to say that the attendance was somewhat limited. The names of those who with the greatest good nature came from Ryde and who did so much to make the concert a success, should have provoked a hearty reception from the dwellers in Ventnor. The programme appended will indicate the character of the entertainment ; and as to the several performers, we do not know that we can say more than that each achieved a perfect success. Miss Wallace, daughter of Col. Wallace, of Ryde, who won the unqualified praise of musical critics by her singing at a concert in the Albert Hall, sang as well as we remember to have heard her, and dispite the rule to the contrary, was obliged to submit to an encore. Miss Jessie Browne was suffering from a slight cold, yet fully sustained her reputation, and won rounds of applause. Miss Abbott, who is the daughter of a gentleman visiting Ventnor, is a performer of great finish, and was vehemently encored. Master Denton sang very sweetly and added very greatly to the pleasure of the afternoon, winning loud applause and a decided encore when he sang "The little tin soldier." Mr. Perkins, also a visitor, is a thorough musician, and a violinist of the highest order. Thanks cannot be too heartily given given to Miss M. Fowles, who most efficiently discharged the part of accompanist throughout. We should not omit to mention that Mr. Bourne, Manager of the Isle of Wight Railway, readily sent passes for those ladies and gentleman of Ryde who so kindly gave their help. The programme was as foliows : Pianoforte Solo, Ballade (Opus 23rd), Miss H. D. Abbot. Song, "Che faro senza Eurydice," Miss Wallace. Song, "The Token," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Vioiiu Soio i\ D. Perkin, Esq. song " Non é Ver," Miss Jessie Browne. Song, "O fond dove, O fair dove," Master Willie Denton. Pianoforte Solo, " Introduzione and Rondo " from Sonata (Opus 53) Miss H. D. Abbott. Song, "Martin the man-at-arms," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Violin Solo, T. D. Perkins, Esq. Song "Waiting," Miss Jessie Browne. Pianoforte Solo, " Soiree de Vienne valse Caprice," Miss H. D. Abbott. Song, "It was a dream," Miss Wallace. Song, Dudley Watkins, Esq. Song, "The Little Tin Soldier," Master W. Denton.

THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

It is now more than six weeks since the Eurydice sank, and, so far from the wreck being nearer the surface, it has become embedded still deeper in sand and clay. Three hundred tons was the strain estimated at the last attempt to raise the vessel, but experience has been gained by the failure, aud the authorities are providing a lifting power of 1,000 tons for the next attempt. Toggles are to be inserted in each porthole, and hawsers attached to them as weil as passed uuder the ship. The lifting power thus obtained will be tremendous, and, unless some parts of the vessel are carried away by the enormous strain, the wreck is almost certain to be lifted. Large steel hawsers are to be used, and in consequence of the increased amount of lift, additional lighters are being prepared. It is proposed to take out the fore and mizen masts before lifting the ship. Although the extent of the requirements of the relief cannot even now be fully known, it has been proved that 43 widows and 50 children have been rendered destitute, and appeals for help have come from 57 mothers, six sisters, and five other relatives.

On Wednesday a body was found floating close to the wreck. It was placed in a boat, aud lowed by a tug into Portsmouth Harbour. From the description of the clothing it was evident that the body was that of one of the crew of the Eurydice. It was in an advanced state of decomposition, and therefore perfectly unrecognisable, except by tattoo marks on the breast, or by the clothes. A diver encountered a body in the fore channel, but in attempting to raise it the hand came off, and this is missing from the body. This is the first body recovered out of the more than 30O persons who went down with the ill-fated craft more than five weeks since. The corpse was taken to Haslar Hospital.

A correspondent writing to a contemporary says : How are we to pronounce the name of the ill-fated vessel which went down in the snow-storm of the 24th ult. ? Classical readers will have no difficulty in deciding on what ought to be the pronunciation, but nine persons out of ten persist in dividing the word into only three syllables, laying the accent on the ultimate, thus— Eu-ry-d*i*ce. The "correct thing," however, is to call the wrecked vessel Eu-ryd-i-ce making it sound as four syllables and accenting the ante-penultimate, or second syllable. In heathen mythology Eurydice was the wife of the poet Orpheus. As she fled before Aristaeus, who wished to do her violence, she was bitten by a serpent in the grass and died of the wound. Orpheus was so disconsolate that he ventured to go to Hades, where, by the melody of his lyre, he obtained from Pluto the restoration of his wife to life provided he did not look behind him before he came upon earth. He violated the condition; his eagerness to see his wife rendered him forgetful, he looked behind and Eurydice was for ever taken from him. Will the attempt to recover the unfortunate vessel be any more successful?

CORRESPONDENCE. THE WRECK THE EURYDICE.

To the Editor of the Evening News.

Sir, —Some three weeks or more ago, it was freely published in various papers throughout the country, that the public were becoming greatly dissatisfied with the fact that the Eurydice, with probably over 150 bodies on board, had not been raised. On Sunday, March 24th, the Eurydice foundered with her living freight off Dunnose, and freely state is a national disgrace that, close proximity to our greatest naval port, the ship should be in far worse state now than when she foundered. Prior to my entering the dockyard service, had some knowledge wrecks, which is thoroughly implanted on my memory. In the present case, there has been employed a Master Attendant, an Assistant Master Attendant, the Chief and Assistant Constructors of Portsmouth Dockyard, and the Master Attendant and Chief Constructor of Chatham Dockyard but with all their superior knowledge (because superior knowledge it must be) the Eurydice still lays where she fonndered. What practical man in wrecking, would have thought of employing such vessels as the Pearl, Rinaldo, two dockyard lighters, and now, the Swan and Wave, both old gunboats. I certainly should not have done so. I should have designed certain camels and placed them in such positions that I am certain, barring all casualties, the Eurydice would long ere this have been safe in Portsmouth Harbour. Nearly a fortnight ago I was talking to Capt. Coppin on other matters, when asked my opinion of the Eurydice, which I gave him. The plan of this country is, unfortunately, to take the advice of the man receiving the largest salary.  
I am, Sir, yours obediently,  
Southsea, May 11. A Practical Shipwright.

THE EURYDICE. Five bodies (or rather portions) have been recovered during the week. One was a seaman named Taylor, and another Lieut. George Falconer, R.M.

The proper pronunciation of the name of the ill-fated ship is Eu-*ryd*-i-ce, making it sound as four syllables, accenting the second.

Operations at the wreck were resumed yesterday (Tuesday). Five toggles have been got in. Both the Pearl and the Rinaldo have been fitted with Merryweather's fire engines, so that, if considered desirable, resort may be had to water ballast. As the lift at the utmost at high water will not exceed 11ft., eight lifts will probably be required to float the sunken vessel into the shallow water in Sandown Bay. The beaching of the vessel has been found to be absolutely necessary, as there is insufficient water in the harbour and fairway at high water to enable the Eurydice to be towed in and docked in much below her normal load-line. It has been proposed to dispense with the lighters altogether. In their stead, and to secure additional buoyancy, two old gunboats, the Wave and the Swan, are to be employed.

*Iron.* – Our prophecy that the "scientific officers" in her Majesty's service would find the Eurydice too much fur them, has, we regret to say, been realised in the most complete manner. There is no doubt that the " fighting officers" in the Royal Navy are, so far as pluck, English grammar, and good manners are concerned, as exeellent gentlemen as any in the service of Britannia. Vicariously they rule the waves for her, but when submarine operations are to the fore they are wofully at fault. The Eurydice affair is a catalogue of melancholy failure. Setting aside the vexed question of seamanship as to her loss, her subaqueous record is full of blundering. The Admiralty very naturally opined that there ought to be somebody about Portsmouth Dockyard who could raise a sunken ship, and orders were forthwith sent to Portsmouth to lift the Eurydice. As it turned out, this decision was unfortunate. Perhaps it might have been as well to employ practical people. Fighting officers always fight well, but they know nothing about raising ships.

*British Medical Journal.* – Both the Royal George and the Eurydice sank in tideways, with very strong currents, which, from the first instant, swept constantly through the hatchways and open ports with searching effect ; so it may be surmised that many unattached floating masses lying in their course would be carried away and rolled into deeper waters or on to the shore. It is a remarkable feature in the Eurydice that so few of the watch on deck floated away from her, and that so very few corpses have been anywhere found. This may perhaps be explained on the suddenness of the struggle for life in the water, and the vortex created by the sinking ship taking them with her to the bottom ; and the same reasons will apply *á fortiori* to the watch off duty and between decks. We think that, by calmly reflecting on such ideas, the minds of those who are now in eager expectation may he brought to a tone conducive to submission to many disappointments on clearance of the vessel.

*Review.* — It was asserted that the frigate had drifted of her own accord from the position in which she lay. The dockyard authorities published a notice, in which they pointed out the incorrectness of this assertion, and naively protested that the ship had not altered her position since she foundered. That protest is also the general complaint of the public. She ought to have altered positin so much as to be now safe in port. We can safely assert that if the Eurydice had been a trading vessel insured in England, she would have been afloat about three weeks ago. Possibly no cable would have been passed round her longitudinally ; probably none would have been passed under her keel. She is so buoyant that hawsers would merely have been passed through her open ports and firmly fixed, and this done she would have been lifted to the surface on the first fine day. We think underwriters may congratulate themmselves on possessing a staff of practical experts who have qualified themselves better than the engineers in Portsmouth dockyard to accomplish the task of raising a sunken vessel.

THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

Late on Friday night a storm set in, and the Rinaldo and the Rinaldo and the lumps, which were moored near the wreck of the Eurydice, had to slip their cables and make for port, in tow of the Griuder. The iron toggles wnich the divers succeeded in dropping into the ports will have to be removed, and their places supplied by wooden toggles of greater bearing area, as the former have been found to bend and come cut under the strain of thirteen tons. The Rinaldo was taken back to her moorings on the following day, and the mauly was out at the wreck on Sunday, when two additional toggles were put into position. Shortly after mid-day two coastguardsmen who were on duty at St. Lawrence observed a body floating about three miles out to sea. They at once launched a boat, and succeeded in bringing the body in tow to Ventnor, where it was found to be that of a marine, evidently from the wreck of the Eurydice. Tne features were beyond identification, but it was found that the body is George Falconer. The body was landed that of on the Isle of Wight, and the Coroner, considering an inquest unnecessary, gave an order for the burial which took place on Tuesday afternoon. The body was interred in Ventnor Cemetery with military honours and a large number of the townspeople attended. The Government tugs and divers resumed operations on Monday, but the boisterous weather prevented much progress being made. On Tuesday morning, however, they again proceeded out of harbour to the wreck. As many as a dozen or 16 toggles will be used if they can be successfully introduced into the ports , the hawsers still remain rouud the Eurydice, with buoys to pick them up. The Pearl was finished for service on Monday, and can be brought into requisition on whatever day it is thought advisable. A telegraphic statement of the exact rise and fall of the tide is daily sent from the wreck to the dockyard authorities, so that they may know when the tide is likely to serve, and they are putting their plans into execution with as much dispatch as is practicable, considering the difficulties which have to be encountered, aud the unfavourable turn of the weather. These difficulties are increasing every day, the wreck having within the last week or ten days sunk further in the mud by several feet.

On Tuesday morning, about 11 o'clock, John Gawn, a fisherman of Portsmouth, while near the Warner light, picked up the body of a seaman belonging to the Eurydice. Just before that time George Comer, a fisherman, of Gosport, had picked up another body near the same spot. Both bodies were towed into harbour and were taken to the Gosport Coastguard station, to which place a handcart and coffins were conveyed from Haslar Hospital, and the bodies were placed in them and taken to the dead-house at that place. One of the bodies was that of a young man whose name is supposed to be William Hendy. Both bodies are in a very advanced stage of decomposition.

The Duke aud Duchess of Edinburgh have forwarded to the Lord Mayor a donation of £ 100 towards the support of the widows, orphans, and dependant relatives of the men who lost their lives in the Eurydice.

Mr. E. J. Physick, sculptor, has been commissioned to execute the monument in memory of Lieut. Frank Tabor, R.N., who was picked up in an exhausted condition, and expired shortly after the sinking of H M.S. Eurydice. The memorial will be erected over the grave in Cheam churchyard, Surrey, and the design prepared by Mr Physick is singularly appropriate as a memento of the sad circumstances which caused its erection.

THE EURYDICE.

The inclement weather of the last few days has kept the operations of the wreck in complete obeyance. It is now hoped that the tides will sufficiently answer *within a fortnight* to enable the attempt to be made to lift the Eurydice ! A waterman has succeeded in up Captain Hare's writing desk, and handed it over to the Coastguard at Bembridge, by whom it was forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief. The gales have disturbed the banks of sand and freed many bodies – several of which have been recovered.

On Saturday two more bodies which were decomposed beyond recognition, picked up near the wreck, were, brought into Portsmouth harbour by the steam tug Grinder and conveyed to Haslar Hospital One is evidently a seaman, thother is believed to be a marine. The Rinaldo reports that the body of an officer passed her as she lay anchored near the wreck on Friday night, but the sea was too rough for a boat to be lowered. The body subsequently washed ashore off Sea View, and has been identified as that of Lieutenant Barry. The south cone was hoisted at the semaphore on Saturday evening, and the gale which sprang up during the night prevented the tugs from proceeding out of harbour during Sunday. The squally weather and the heavy gale from the W.S.W. will, it is expected, tend to ease the position of the the wreck, and lead to large numbers of bodies floating through the ports.

FOUNDERING OF H.M.S. EURYDICE. - The prevalence of high swinds and strong tides have pre- e vented anything like successful operations being carried out by the authorities engaged in the attempt to raise | the Erytdice. The efforts of the party arc by no means er le relaxed, and advantage is taken of every opportunity ah which presents itnelfi Four bodies, however, have been m recovered since Saturday. The first was that of a marine it named George Falconer, which was observed by the Coast- guardsmen at St. Lawrence, early on Sunady afternoon. The body was brought ashore by a boat which the Coast- guard put off in, and on the Isle of Wight Coroner bein communimcated' vith,. he did'not consider au inquest n necessary. Yesterday morning three othgr bodies were it picked up near the Noman Fort and the Werner lightship, d by Geofg e'Connor, flshennan, ef Gosport, John Gawn, a, boatman, of Portsmouth, and Joleph Briggs. Two of the e bodies Were taken to the GOport shre, and landed at the n Cosstgnard jetty, where they were received by Mr. ?? George, the Chief Officer of the station.. The y officials at Haslar Hospital were ?? with and Inspeetor-GeneralW.T ?? Do nillc, c.n., tl.D, had ,odins e sent down to fth jetty, and the bodies were conveyed in them to the dead-house at the Hospital. In order that i- there should be no delay in the identification of the it corpses, Mr. Superintendent Cheyney communicated by n telegraph with the County Coroner (Edgar Goblc, Esq.), h who decided to hold the inquest on the bodies at once. to ?? Jury were, in consequence, hastily summoned, if andmct at Haslar Hospital last evening. The two bodies If were identified by Charles Carter, foreman of labourers se at the Hospital, who stripped.them, and found the nmmees of the men upon the clothing. The bodies were those of Is Edward Lockett and William E. Sandy, ordinary scalien, x second class. An excellent arrangement has been made t- for the identification of the bodies. The Inspector- ie General has had a complete list made of the whole of the a- crew and passengers of the Eurdice-321 in number. h The names marked on the clothing of the bodies recovered are compared with this list, and providing there is no r other way of recognizing the corpses,..identilication can n be established by this means. Both bodice were d much decomposed, the flesh being entirely removed s from the faces, and the hands were also missing. Sandy had on a. serge, a flannel, a check shirt, Ls trowacrs, &e.; and Lockett had. on two flannels and d a check shirt and trowsers. The lower jaw of Sandy was a entirely gone. In his troweaers pocket were found one d penny piece, three halfpence, and two buttons. Formal r- evidence of identification was taken, 'and the inquest was vadjournedtothe date originally fixedthe 23rd inst. The men Sino recovered the bodies were bound over to appear then, and also,thetwo ?? irtin Cuddeford and Sidney Id Fletcher, the latter being sick, a patientin Haslar Hospital A- The funeral of the two men will take place this (Wednes- day) afterneon. The third body, which was landed on the ie Portsmouth side of the harbour, was conveyed in a shell to the dead-house adjoining Porteca police-station As it ts had been landed within the jurisdiction of the Borough d Coroner, it was thought that an inquest would be held by d that gentleman, but it appears that this duplication of d depositions is not likely to occur, as the Coroner expressed aa desire that if the Chief-Constable were satisfied that the t body had come from the Eetrvdice, it might be conveyed to a Hasiarashe considered it inexpedient that inquiries should 0 be opened in various parts of the county on the ?? mat- t tr. The body, although not identified up to last night, t has no doubt come from the ill-fated ship. It has on a pair dof laced boots, brown Botks, blue cloth troweers wliteshirt, eland drawers, and short blue serge jacket. This latter Aarticle leads to the supposition that the body is either than 'f of an officer's servant or steward. At all events he evidently belonged to the non-combatant elass. Thebones i5 of the head were perfcetly bare, and both bands had been .t eaten off. The flesh had also come off a considerable por- y tion of the right arm, the bones of which were bared for d several inches. The corpse will be removed to Haslar, h where it will be stripped, and identification will no doubt :d be established by the marking of the clothing. Nothing is was found in the pockets of t'he deceased. A ,FUNERAL OF THE MARINE. 5Our Veatnor correspondent telegraphs last night that k the funeral of George Falconer, the marine whose body 3 was picked up off Ventnor on Sunday, took place yesterday ib afternoon. The hearse containing the body was follored Le from the Esplanade to Ventnor Cemetery by Captain Y, Roche, I.N., Inspecting-Commander of St. Catherine's .o Division,; Mr. Clarke, Chief Officer of Ventnor Station; t. and about twenty Coastguardmen of the Division; fifty- id five men of the 5th Isle of Wight Rifle Volunteers (-hich 1- was a very good muster, considering the short notice given v d, and the funeral taking place during the working hours),' a- under the command of Captain G. N. Burt and Lieu- bh tenant Henry Owen. The certege was headel by the a Battalion band laying the Dead March in Said. 5- Many leading inhabitants of the town also followed in the Be procession and the greatest sympathy and resp ot was at by the numerous bystanders as the mournful coreaqe wound its way up the circuitous roads leading to ad heights ahove Veutnor, on which the Cemetery is t at.

THE EURYDICE.

The funeral of the late Lieutenant S. A. B. Burney was held at Haslar Cemetery on Tuesday afternoon in a spot which has been selected for the officers whose bodies may be recovered from the wreck of the Eurydice. The corpses of the crew are being buried in a plot of ground adjoining the square in which the sufferers from the Thunderer explosion are laid, and the spots which have been chosen for the graves of the officers lie on each side of the middle line, and contiguous to the site on which it is proposed to raise a memorial of the disaster. Lieut. Burney was buried with naval honours, the funeral cortege being composed of a couple of officers in full dress and of the aame rank as the deceased, and twenty bluejackets from each man-of-war in the harbour, headed by a firing party of 100 rank and file from the Boyal Marines, under the command of Captain Bsmber, and the band of Her Majesty'a ahip St. Vincent, which played Dead Marchea to the Cemetery. The father of the deceased, Captain Burney (Superintendent of the Greenwich Hospital Schools), and hia three sons were the chief mourners, and were followed by the Rev. E. Burney, Captain Balliston, of the Alberta, and a number of personal frienda in and out of uniform. The coffin having been covered with a Union Jack and placed on a gun carriage, was drawn to the Cemetery by seamen of the fleet, the pall being supported by Commander Hulton, Staff-Commander Macfarlane, and four senior lieutenants. The funeral service was read by the Rev. F. W. Nickoll, the chaplain of the hospital, and the usual three volleys were fired over the grave. Lieutenant Burney, who waa only 23 at the time of his death, joined the Eurydice on her being commissioned for the special service on which she waa employed, having just previoualy gained his lieutenant's commission as a reward for passing a highly satisfactory examination at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. He was considered one of the most promising young officers in the service, and his loss is deeply deplored by his friends and relatives. His body was picked up on Saturday morning by a pilot boat about a couple of miles out to sea to the eastward of the wreck, and was landed at Sea View, Isle of Wight, and thence conveyed to Haslar Hospital. The body was identified by means of a gold watch, which bore an inscription showing that it had been presented to the deceased by his father on obtaining his lieutenant's commission. The tugs and divers went out to the wreck of the Eurydice on Wednesday morning, but in consequence of a heavy swell prevailing at the back of the Wight they returned again into harbour. Hicks, the shipwright diver, made a descent, and found that the result of the late gales had been to bring the upper sill of the lee ports on a level with the mud bottom. The channels are now within 1ft. of the sea floor, and as the ship retains the same angle of heel, it is evident that she has sunk 2 1/2ft. further into the ground, that the lee ports are now wholly under the sand, and that she is fast making a hole for herself. During the high tide of Tuesday a diver's boat was stove in, and one ofthe mooring lighters received a great deal of injury and was nearly swamped. On Wednesday morning the body of Albert C. Doogood. an ordinary seaman of the first class, was landed at Sea View, Isle of Wight, by a pilot boat, and afterwards taken to Haslar.

*To the Editor of the Hampshire Advertiser.*

Sir,— Will you kindly oblige by correcting an error in your paper of to-day respecting the picking up of the body of Lieut. S. A. B. Burney of H.M S Eurydice, by the Coastguard at Sea View. The facts are that the body was picked up at sea by the Emma, pilot cutter, of this place, brought here, and given in charge of the chief boatman, who telegraphed to the Admiralty at Portsmouth. A Government seam tug was at once sent, wbich took the body to Portsmouth. I am, sir, your obedient servant,  
Henry Knapp, pilot,  
Emma, pilot cutter.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

Writing from Portsmouth on Saturday, a says:—

Within the last ten days no fewer than sixteen bodies from the Eurydice have been picked up. Eight had been recovered up to Thursday. On Friday six were found in the neighbourhood of Chichester, and on Saturday two were brought in to Portsmouth Harbour. One of three was the body of George Curd, an ordinary martian, which was identified by the name on the jacket; and the other was the body of John Mitchell, a chief petty officer and seaman gunner which was identified by his widow by some tattoo marks on his arm.

THE "EURYDICE" FATALITY.

*Republishes the Hampshire Advertiser article of Saturday 25 May 1878, but ends short and slightly differently:*

During the recent gales the Eurydice has sunk two feet and a half further into the mud, and the misgivings as to the possibility of her being raised are now materially strengthened.

THE EURYDICE

Exactly two mouths had elapsed last Sunday since the capsising of the Eurydice, which lies buried still deeper in the sandy bottom, defying the ingenuity of the officials and the vast store of appliances which have been brought into requsition for the purpose of raising the wreck. Anxiety as to the lifting of the ill-fated ship continues, and doubts are expressed as to whether it will ever to come to the surface unless blown up— an idea most repugnant to those having friends on board. Work was attempted again on Sunday, but the tugs had to return in consequence of the high wind blowing. The divers succeeded on Saturday in inserting a toggle into the lee side of the ship. Several more bodies have been picked up on the Sussex coast.

A portion of the wreckage of this vessel has been washed ashore at Rottingdean, and on Friday the bodies of two of the seamen were discovered in the sea near Saltdean. They had evidently been in the water for a considerable time, the feet and hands being eaten away, and they presented altogether a terribly decomposed and shocking appearance. The clothing on the bodies were respectivel) marked "G. Gordon" and "A. Barnes. On Friday evening the body of another seaman was picked up at Lancing. The body was in a very decomposed state, especially about the extremities. The name "J. Appledore" was marked on the guernsey under the collar.

Another body was picked up at Selsey on Monday, but identification was impossible in consequence of the state in which it was discovered.

*The Army and Navy Gazette* remarks :— The statement made by a weekly contemporary that " the efforts made by the Admiralty to raise the Eurydice are nothing more than what is in theatrical parlance termed 'gag'— that in fact, they have never seriously intended to raise her"— is nothing less than fiction. The Admiralty fully intended to raise the ship, and the fault of the whole work has been that those entrusted with the preparations under-estimated the difficulties, and apparently did not take pains to ascertain what kind of bottom she was resting on. That she may never be raised is not now at all beyond belief, but it will be owing to error and not design if she never floats again.

We are inclined to the opinion of many who ought to know something of the matter, that the Eurydice will never be raised. She would, doubtless, have been blown up long ago, but for the effect this would have had on the feelings of the relatives of the unfortunate men, for the *attempt* to raise has cost perhaps as much as two or three Eurydices would ; and even if she were got up she would not be worth anything. We believe she will remain till all the bodies have disappeared, and then a charge of dynamite will cause their temporary coffin to disappear also.

THE CHIEF CONSTRUCTOR ON THE EURYDICE, &c.—

The chief constructor of the Dockyard (Mr. W. B. Robinson), addressing the members of the Literary and Scientific Society, lat week, said that non-attention to science was sure to lead to failure, and sometimes to catastrophe. The capsising of H.H.S. Captain would have been prevented had the officer in command read an article previously written by the present member for Pembroke. That article would have taught him the folly of carrying sail on the ship under the circumstances it was carried when she went down. There was a more recent catastrophe which he would not discuss, but he very much regretted— and it was common enough to regret— that science had not been called in for more than four weeks to devise the best means of raising the Eurydice. It was essential that a man should know enough of ordinary things in a scientific manner, in order to foresee what was likely to happen. The President (Mr. J. Douglas) remarked that it was a disgrace to engineering men that that vessel should remain unraised, and the scandal was the greater that Captain Coppin, of the Steam Salvage Company, offered to raise the Eurydice immediately afer the disaster, but received no reply for nearly a fortnight, when his offer was declined with thanks. As he understood, Captain Coppin had afterwards offered to bring up the bodies from the ship, but this offer was also declined.

ESCAPE OF A RYDE MAN FROM THE EURYDICE DISASTER.

A young man named Hayes, whose mother was a member of the Sivell family of this town, had a very fortunate escape from being lost in the ill0fated ship. About a week before the vessel sailed from the West Indies, hayes was taken ill, and had to be taken on shore to the hospital. His friends at first thought he was drowned, but a letter has, since the disaster, been received, which announced the gratifying fact that Hayes is alive and restored to health.

OPENING OF THE NEW PIER.

Sandown was en fete on Wednesday, the day fixed for the op ning of the new pi^r, and every one seemed impressed with the fact that th>; event was j one of no ordinary importance in the history of th- 1 litrle town. Lady Oglander very kindly consented to petform the opening ceremony, but so unpropiti- ous was the weather at the beginning of the day j that for some time it was doubtful whether a post- j ponemenfc Avould not be necessary. The rain fell all the morning without ceasing, a*nd of course made the roads in the neighbourhood of the pier dirty and muddy ; but, as the hour fixed for the cerenv ny ap- proached, the t-ky commenced clearing, and by o o'clock it was tolerably fine. A considerable num- ber of persona then began to flock to the pier, the j approaches to which were decorated with banners and flags. Across the street which Lady Oglander would have to pass was stretched a banner, bearing the arms of the Oglander family and the motto "Server Mania Vitre," on each side of which was the word " Welcome." Above the street leading to the pier was a banner bearing the words "Success to the Pier," and over the pier gates another, bid- ding all " Welcome." There was also plenty of bunting about, a number of poles being placed at regular intervals en both sides of the pier, and each carrying a gay flag. With respect to the pier itself, which next claims our notice, it must not be under- stood that it is actually finished. Only a portion of the structure — half the total length contemplated — is finishe. , but of course this is suflirient to give a good ider. of its general effect, and makes a very nice promenade. Unlike the piers we have seen else- where, the seats run down the whole length. From the pierhead can be obtained capital views, not only seaward but of the c iffs, sands, and general b'cenery of the interior of the Island. The pi? r looks a very lig't structure — nn. omfortably so, in fact. The iron piles on which it rests are so slight, and their distance one from the oth^r is so great, as to lead one to doubt whether it will be found sufficiently strong to withstand the winter waves Avhieh roll into the bay. This uncomfortable feeling was in- tensified by the appearance of a. wreck close at hand — the John Douse— highly suggestive of the stormy waters which the structure will have to withstand ; while fun her out to sea, and almost in line with the hi ad of the pier, was another di.-m.al sight — the ma>ts of the wreck of the Eurydice, still beneath the waters, and still holding many a score of the bodies of brave young tars These were two things highly suggestive of what the winds and waves can do about here. We suppose, however, that the light- ness of the pier just at the parts which are finished does not matter, and doubtless the structure will be ma le more substantial a-» it reaches that portion of the shore where the full fury of the waves will be c countered. However, a pier seems to be a neces- sity for bandown, and we congratulate the inhabi- tants of the little town upon their energy and evi- dent determination to improve the place. THE OPENING CEREMONY. Shortly after 1 o'clock the townspeople began to flock to the pier. A number of the n^ ember d of the Nuuwrll Volunteers were drawn up on each side of the pier gates, as a sort of gu ird of honour, under the command ot their popular young captain (A. Brook Leeds, Esq.) and Lieut P uud, while the band was stationed at the end of the pier to add harmony to the proceedings. Amongst those assem- bled at the pier gates to welcome Lady Oglander on her arrival were F. Pittis, E.-q (Mayor of Newport), Col. (Jurrie (chairmau of the VV-ntnor Local Board), Mr. Walter Mew (chairman of the Sandowu Local Board), W. 11. Wooldridge, Esq (clerk to the Local Board), Mr. Eldridge (town clerk of Newport), the Rev. YV. M. Harrison, Dumpier Child, Esq , and the following members of the Sandown Local Board : Dr. Bulbeck, Messrs. Linn Id, Love, J. K. Hollis, Warne, Pelley, and Box. L idy Oglander arrived punctually at the time fixed, accompanied by Major Leeds, and on alighting from her carriage was re- ceived by Mr. Wooldridge, who introduced the Chairman and members of the Sandown Local Board to her ladyship. Mr. Walter Mew (chairman) then -topped torward and presented h°r ladyship with an address from the Board In doing so he expressed trie great pleasure he felt in seeing her ladyship present, and thauked her for the interest she had al- ways taken in Sandown, at the same time express- ing the hope that she would long be spared to them. Mr. Wooldridge then reai the address, which was handsomely engrossed on vellum, an I signed by 155 ratepayers and inhabitants of the district. It was as follows : To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Park, Isle of Wight. Madam, — ?? tuo Local B ard of the disrrict of San- duwu, ?? Wi^ht, and the undersigned ratepayers md mhnbitants of the district, beg respectfully to express the great pleasure and giatification whi h it gives us to •<ee your ladyship taking p.ut in, and inaugurating; the .pening of a Pier in taudown. We are wed as-ured that your ladyship at all times takes aa interest in all ■natters connected with the pubac welfare of Sandown and its inhabitants ; knowing, as we do, the readiness and liberality with which yo-i have always cunrnbur d ro, and assisted ail chariiable, and other local undertak- ings, we trust that your ladyship may long be spared aud be a^le to assist, aud participate in all public erne - prises which may c >nduce to the prosperity of the town ■>f Sandowu, in which, as Lidy of the Manor, we f«el sure you wi.l alwa}s have a deep and sincere in'treat. With ever expression of respect aud estee v, We are, your ladyship's faithful servants, Walter Mew, Chairman. The Common Seal of the Local B ard of Sand wn. was affixed, this 27th day uf May, 1873, in pursuance of a resolution unanimously passed at a special meeting, held oi the 24 'h day of May, 1878, in the presence of Mr. H. Wooldridge, clerk to the B ard. Leaning on the arm of .Major Leeds, her ladyship then walked to the end of tho pier, which had been carpeted for the occasion. Here she was introduced to the chairman and directors of the Pier Company Her ladyship having bri fly declared the pier open, Mr. Jonathan Jollitfe, the chairman of the company, stepped forward and presented her ladyship with. ano her address. He expl lined that the company had a hard struggle to get the pier completed so far, but they hoped to be able to make the structure double its present length, and to place a lifeboat at the end. It would then be very useful for yachts aud steamers, which would be able to land passen- gers here. He then presented the address, which was also engrossed on vellum, and read as follows : To Lady Oglauder, N unwell Ptrk. Isle . f VVi^ht. Madam, — The chairman and directors of the Sandown Pier Uoinp-iuy, heg to welcome your ladysuip .n this, to them, important occasion, and at the same time ex- press iheir sincere thanks f>r your kindness in consent- ing to preside a' the opening of the pier. It is only alter having overcome many difficulties, and even local 'Pposilion, that the directors have at length succeeded iv coiupleiing the iirst s«oti- >n of the pier, so as to permit the same to be opened for the use of 'he public. However, they hope to receive such pecuniary assistance from residents, owners nf property, and oihi-ra inceresied in the welfare of Saudowu., as may enable them 'o Complete the original design, and carry out the pier to ir» full lengih of 650 teet, being nearly double the length of the p.nion already constructed, and so kindly opened by >our ladyship. — The directors are sure thatthe pier will atford a pleasaut and agreeable promenade, and prove a source of attraction to the towa of Sand >wu and its vii.ors; and they venture also to hope that it may ultimately prov • useful, not only for purp -ses of recrea- tion, but also a station from which a lifeboat may bo launched. R cent sad events tiut have taken place in tuc bay deepen the conviction that Sandown will prove a most iin port-in t stati in foi a lifeb >at. ?? the carrying I out so laudable an object the directors can only trust to the libeniliiy and sympathy of the public geuernlly — j Again thanking y>>ur ladyship tor the k'ud interest you j have shown in the w rk the directors have in hand by J your presence here to-day, and with every good wish for ! your welfare and happiness, We beg to remain, Your ladyship's obedient aud fitiihful oervants Jonathan Jo luff e, KicHA.tD Dampiek Child, George Pelley, James Kennington. The seal of the Sandown Pier Company (Limited) was affixed this 28th day of May, 1878, in pursuance of a resolution duly parsed at a meeting of the directors ia the presence of W. H. Wouldridge, secretary. This portion of the ceremony concluded, Miss Brandt ; stepped forward, and, on behalf of the d-rtctors presented her ladyship with a very handsome bou- quet. Her ladyship briefly replied as follows; "Mr , Chairman and gentleman oi the Sandown Locai Board and gentlemen of the Sandown Pier Company -I thank you v ry much for the kind and gratify- ! ing reeepti-m you have given me. It atf-rds me at I ail times siucere pleasure to assist iv any way in , promoting the prosperity oi" Sandown, and I trus. the undertakii.g you have so biiccts.-fully curried out aud inaugurated this day may prove one of the many means of adding to the attractions of the place, and tin additional source of heakh and enjoyment to ; visitors and iiihitbi>:m r s alike. ' Hearty h»-ers wer i th n given for hey Jady>hip, and a number ot the yeutl9m«a present having been introduced tv her j *© procession again went up the pier; her ladyship I a L A1 « l ]>r Leeds re-entered their carringe, and drove | oft amidst the loud cheers of the assembled specta- | tow. This concluded the ceremony, which was fol- I lowed by A B.VNQUBT, which took pla".o at half-past 5, in the Town Hall, where about 70 gnntl-men sat down to the excellent repast provided. The chair was taken by Mr. Jon. ! Jolliffe, and the viee-chair by Mr. Walter Maw; : there being also present Capt. Brook Leeda, Lieut'. i Pound, Col. Currie, Rev. W. M. Harrison, Mr. W. i H. Wooldridge, Col. Brandt, Mr. F. Pitt is, Mr. F. Pittas, jun., Mr. T. H. Urry, Mr. W. H. Barton, Mr. C. Cr. Vincent, Dr. Meerea, Mr. Binn» (engineer), I Mr. D. Mitchell, Mr. Linfield, Mr. J. K. Hotiis, Mr. ! L. H. Saunders, Mr. Theodore Saunders, &c. After ! the removal of the cloth, Mr. Wooldeidoe read letters of apology from Mr. ! Baillie Cochrane, M.P. (who was unable to attend ! owing to the state of his health), the Mayors of I Rydo, Yarmouth ?? and Andover, Mr. F. White Popham, Col. Calthorpe, and others. The Chairman briefly proposed tho usual loyal toasts, which were heartily responded to. He then, proposed "The Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces," coupling with the toast the names of CoL Currie, Col. Brandt, and Capt. Brooke Leeds. Col Currik congratulated those present upon adding a pier to the attractions of Sandown ; and then, .speaking to the toast, said he had seen a great deal of war, and what he had aeen of its horrors led him to hope that peace would be maintained, and if it was maintained with honour to the country it J would be the brightest star in the escutcheon of tho j noble lord who now presided over the destinies of the country (applause). Col. Brandt, who also responded, was suro that in the present unfortunate discussion England would do her be&t to be on the right side, and should it end in war the Army, who had never yet been backward when called on, would do va best (applause). God forbid it should end in bloodshed, for he was sure no Englishman wished to *ee that ; all they wished was to see justice and right done (applause). If we did have a peace he hoped it would not be a patijhed-up peac >, but that the question would now be so .settled that there could be no chance of its be- ing brought forward again (applause). Capf. Brook* Leeds, in responding for the Volun- | teers, si id that the corps he commanded owed a great deal to Sandown, and the numbers who had ; joined them from that town enabled them to muater more strongly in proportion than the corps belong- ing to large and important towns. They would not be able to keep the corps up to this position without the help of Sandown. They had ju.st drafted l» Sandown men into the corps, and their band was composed five-tenths of Sandown men. T^eir corps then was virtually, except in name, a Sandown corps. The Volunteers as a body had no politics, and were always ready to do their duty it calkd on ; but they could not forget that, in spite of the many matters of importance which our present Govern- ment had to attend to, they had remembered tho Volunteers. A Volunteer commission had been ap- pointed to take into consideration the wants and requirements of the force. Although the Volunteers hnd their grant there were many other things re- quir d, which would no doubt be supplied (applause). Mr. Daxpier Guild proposed M The Bishop and Clergy of the Diocese and the Ministers of all De- nominations." In spire of certain difference* he thought the Church had the hearty good wishes of all true Englishmen. After regretting the abseuce of the Vicar, he coupled with the toast the names of the Rev. W. M. Harrison to respond for the Bishop and clergy, and the Rev. Mr. King for the ministers of other denomination-!. The Rev. W. M. Harrison said he was extremely pleased to be present on such an auspicious day for Sandown, and he wished their new institution every success. Mi-. Dampier Child had alluded to diffe- rences of opinion in the Church, but he asked where they did not find differences of opinion. It was no when he was a boy, and he supposed always would be i-o ; but he believed that, in spite of differences of opinion, his brethren of the Church and those amongst the Nonconformists were ceming more into accord, and beginning to see that there was not such a great gulf between them but what they could shake hands ever it. He hoped they would give them credit for that, and would see that though they were parsons on Sunday they had their hearty sympathy on all occasions. The Rev. Mr. Kino said he trusted that ministers of all denominations were beginning to see that they were building on one great foundation, and all endeavouring to inculcate one njble principle — giod will towards men. He was very pleased to be present on t-uch an occasion. Having been intimately associated with Saudown for a great number of years in greatly rejoiced him to see its increasing P'O-perity. He believed the construction of the new pier wonld prove a great thing for Sandown, and he hoped that, when completed, it would be crowned with success. Mr. Peixey in eulogistic terms proposed the health of Lady Oglander, who always took such interest in the town, and had given £10 towards the expenses of the day (loud applause and cheers). Capt. Le-.ds re-ponded, and said he wished to tell them what Mr. Wooldridge evidently forgot, that his father, Major Leeds, was unable to be present, and had only been able to attend that afternoon at s >me ri.-ik to himself, for he was very far from well. He thanked them for the hearty way in which tho toast was proposed and received. It was unnecessary for him to dilute on the kindness of Lady Oglander. One could not praise one's own relations very well, but he thought they would remember that it was a very difficult matter for any lady to take part in public matters. When, however, Lady Oglander was asked to open the pier, she at once complied, and although the day was not everything which wished, she came and went through the ceremony (applause). It was a pleasmre foe her to do anything to help Sandown. He then thanked them heartily on her behalf. Mr. L. H. Saumdhrs proposed " Success and Prosperity to the Sandown Pier." He should like to say a few words on the subject, which, as he wad a resident outside Sandown, he hoped would be ac- cepted in all sincerity. The pier so far had been built by a mere handful of men. Fewer men than we** assembled in that room had found the capital necessary to build what was nothing less than an institution — the pier which they had seen so ably opened by Lady Ox lander that day, and he trusted that all those present, who had not yet done so, had decided to become shareholders. The capital re- quired was £6,0 00, in 1,200 shares of £5 each, to build a pier 6o0 feet long, with the object, not only of benefiting the resi ieuts, but of bringing an ad- ditional number of visitors to Sandown. Perceiving the advantages of such a pier a number of the gen- tlemen present had put their hands in their pockets, and mor- than half the capital required had already been subscribed. He thought they ought not to be backward now, for he believed greater profit would accrue uow than at the commencement. The pier as at. pr -sent fiui.-hed was 3-50 feet lonj? and 20 feet wide, and it possessed one advantage which they did not often see. He had been on a great many piers*, and he found seats generally rather scarce, but on the Sandown pier he noticed th-tt *eats ran from end to end, and there was plenty of room for those who could not walk about. He thought that arrange- ment would greatly contribute to the success of the undertaking. All that was wanted now was the means tor providing the remainder of the money re- quired, ami for an outlay of another £2,500 or so they would be able to complete the pier to the length he had mentioned, so that th-y woull always have nine or ten teet of water at the end of the pier, suf- ficient tor steamers to come alongside at all times and take up or put down excursionists. Although they had a ralway to Sandown they wanted some- thing more— accommodation by water, and he hoped to fin'1 no difficulty in doing that. He believed it wasafuctthatallth^prel miuary expensesof thiacom- pany—-getting the Bill in Parliament, <fcc— in f*ct, all their Parliamentary expenst- s, were covered by a cheque for £200 That was sufficient to show that there was no promotion money paid, and he thought such a company, with responsible directors and not overweighted, must be a success. The directors, in addition to the ldige amount of shares they had token, rathe;- than open tho pier with any liability upon it, had given their names and taken a personal liability for £200 each beyond their holding. That showed the sort of opinion the directors had of »ho | undertaking. In proposing rhe to .st he I oped that every Sandown man would take a share. — The toast was received with three times three. The Cii-UKXAX said they were going to carry on the undertaking in an honest, straightforward way and if they only revived support They would nuke the pier oue of the k>t litile properties in the U Qo f Wight. He had upeut a great tkal of tim« and m >ney on the Newport Junction Kail way, and if that

THE EURYDICE. ACROSTIC ON THE WRECK OF THE EURYDICE.

By J. S. Edwards, Sailor on H.M.S. Royal Adelaide.

Each heart was light and hopeful on board that noble ship,  
Unconscious of the danger near before the sundown dip  
Revealing to the light of day, 'midst white sails spread around,  
Youth's gallant form and manhood strong, that now in death are found.  
Dread cloud of woe which overcast their brightest hopes in night,  
Immersing in engulfing death, the brave, the loved, the bright.  
Come England, spread thy gen'rous hand in pity o'er their grave, Endeavouring thus to honour those entombed beneath the wave.

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Lords on Monday,  
Lord Dorchester asked Her Majesty's Government whether any and, if so, what steps had been taken since a first attempt, that failed, to raise H.M. S. Eurydice, sunk off Dunnose on the 24th March last ; whether there had been any consultations relating thereto between the dockyard and other naval authorities, and whether any eminent engineers, civil or military, had been invited to give their opinions ; also whether any firms, such as " The Steamship Salvage Company" or other persons experienced in such matters, had been invited to afford assistance towards or to tender for raiding the vessel ; and whether there was any objection to produce any papers relating thereto. The noble lord said that there were three or four large firms in this country with special appliances for raising ships. One of them had entered into a contract to raise the Vanguard. Within four miles of where the Eurydice was lying a large ship had been raised by one of these firms. He believed that competent authorities denounced the means taken for raising the Eurydice, and it was scarcely creditable to the first maritime Power in the world that the ship should have been lying for ten weeks in ten fathoms of water.

Lord Elphinstone, before answering the question just put to him, wished, in reply to an enquiry made by a noble lord on Friday night, to say that there was to be no naval review off Portsmouth this week. As to the question of the noble lord (Lord Dorchester), he was not surprised at it. Many persons who were interested in the matter were imperfectly acquainted with what was doing and had been done. They were unaware of the difficulties to be overcome, and expressed surprise at the apparent slow progress made in raising the Eurydice. He was very glad the noble lord had given him an opportunity of explaining at somewhat greater length than on previous occasions the difficulties the naval authorities had had to contend against. The question embraced four distinct subjects. With regard to papers, there were really none, except a short daily journal kept by the officer in charge of working parties. This would show better than any words of his the difficulties which had to be encountered. It was made up to the 29th ult., and would show that out of the 67 days since the ship sank the working had only been able to work during portions of 27 days, sometimes for not more than one or two hours out of the 24. During 40 days they had been unable to work at all on account of the weather. The divers had only been able to work 80 hours in all. The lighters had to slip their moorings and run into harbour for shelter no fewer than 11 times, and had to slip again last Saturday. There was no objection to laying that journal on the table. He thought he mentioned on a former occasion that the Admiralty decided from the first that the business of raising the Eurydice should be entrusted to the dockyard authorities at Portsmouth, where there was a most efficient staff of officers, both scientific and practical, who meet in consultation almost daily. They were presided over by the Admiral Superintendent, Admiral FolEy, who was assisted by the Chief Constructor, Mr. Robinson ; Captain Polkinghorne, Master Attendant ; Captain Batt, Master Attendant of Chatham dockyard, who was employed for a considerable time in connection with the operations at the wreck of the Vanguard; Captain Dathan, Captain Moss, and Captain Palmer, Staff Commanders. It would be difficult to get together a stronger or a better Board. They were all agreed in thinking that under the circumstances of the case, and with the appliances at their disposal, no plan could be adopted more likely to ensure success than the one they were at present endeavouring to carry out. They were animated with but one desire, and that was to succeed, and no exertions were being spared in order to attain that result. The Admiralty had not invited the opinion of any civil engineer. The matter was one which the scientific and the pracical skill the Department had at its disposal at Portsmouth dockyard was quite able to deal, and he very much doubted whether there was any civil engineer who had had any experience whatever in raising weights such as that with which the authorities had to deal and under similar circumstances. He need scarcely add that it had not been felt necessary to invite the opinion of any military men. For the same reasons as those which he had already mentioned, they had not invited the assistance of the Steamship Salvage Company or any person experienced in raising vessels, and he was not aware that either the Steamship Salvage Company or, indeed, any other person had any experience in raising vessels under the circumstances of the present case. There were cases of ships having been saved, and, indeed, of having been raised in smooth water and out of a strong tideway, but there was no instance on record of a ship having been raised under circumstances similar to or in any approaching those in which the Eurydice was placed. The only case at all resembling the present was that of H.M.S. Pincher, a schooner of 180 tons, sunk in 14 fathoms of water off the Owers, in 1837, and it was four months before they succeeded in getting her into Portsmouth harbour. The Admiralty had been inundated with offers. Now, as to the steps which were being taken, he would remark that they had to deal with a deadweight of between 400 and 500 tons, lying 12 fathoms below water in a strong tideway, with a current running between four and six knots an hour, and with slack water varying from 30 to 90 minutes. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a spot on the whole coast of Great Britain where greater difficulties existed in regard to such an operation — difficulties not only below water on account of the tide, but also difficulties above water on account of the tide and the weather combined for a nasty sea got up at that spot very quickly with the slightest provocation. The Eurydice sank on the 24th March, and it was not until the 27th April that they were able to make an attempt to move che wreck. They did so by means of two corvettes — the Rinaldo and ihe Pearl — which had been temporarily converted into lighters. That attempt failed on account of the breaking of one of the hawsers, and then, after consultation on the part of the Board to which he had referred, it was determined by the authorities at Portsmouth to adopt what might be called tho over-lift principle, which simply meant that, instead of placing the lighters round the sunken ship as before, they would be placed immediately over her. They would be attached to the wreck by eight steel hawsers toggelled through her main-deck poits, and six jewel hawsers would also be passed round the ship. In addition to that, it was intended to make use of her two bower cables, and also of the Russian air bag, which had a lifting capacity of 40 tons. That would give some idea, of the difficulties which had to be overcome. No fewer than 16 different attachments had to be made, and an equal strain brought to bear upon them all. Should it come on to blow, or any sea get up, those attachments must all be slacked and probably let go, the lighters would have to seek shelter in port, as they had had to do no fewer than 11 times already, and the whole work would have to be begun ever again when the weather settled. But that was not all. It was supposed that the bottom where tho Eurydice sank was hard ground, and so it was. There was a crust of hard ground, but below that was soft, fine sand. It would appear that the ship struck the ground with great force, for her starboard cathead was knocked away and a portion of her keel was sticking out under her stern. The result was that the hard crust was broken, and the ship had been gradually settling in the soft sand. During the late gales she was settling bt the rate of 2in. a day Fortunately she was not settling any more at present. But she was now 11 1/2ft. in the sand, and out of that hole she had to be lifted and placed upon a new bed. That once done the main difficulties would be practically overcome ; and if the weather would only hold up he hoped the work might soon be successfully accomplished, although he was bound to add that he no longer looked upon it as in any way a matter of certainty. But this he would say, that not nil the "eminent engineers," civil or even military, aided by the Steamship Salvage Company or any private firm, could have hastened the raising of the Eurydice by one hour. In conclusion, he had a plan of the manner in which it was sought to raise the ship that he would be happy to show the noble lord.

Lord Dorchester asked whether the attempt to raise her would be more to-morrow.

Lord Elphinstone said that would depend entirely on the weather.

THE EURYDICE.

The gale on Monday night and Tuesday has led to a suspension of the operations at the wreck of the Eurydice. W. H. Smith, rigger diver, and three London divers slept on board the Rinaldo on Monday night, being ordered to commence the work of shackling the toggles immediately the tide answered. The high winds and a rough sea, however, rendered it advisable to return into harbour, and three Government tags were dispatched to bring in the four lighters and the divers' boats. For some time it was impossible to get the tug alongside the Rinaldo for the purpose of taking on board the men employed at the wreck, and one of a tug's crew got overboard and narrowly escaped drowning. After the divers' boats had been taken in tow and were being brought by Bembridge Ledge, where the full force of the gale was felt, one broke adrift, and the three others were considerably damaged, the rigger divers' boat losing its port bow, another most of its after-part, and the other its stern and gunwhale, as well having its diving apparatus disabled. It was not expected that the boats could be floated into harbour, but this difficulty being overcome they were at once put into the dockyard hands for immediate repair, the divers to be supplied with others till they have been rendered serviceable. During the gale, two men were disabled, the engineer of the lighter having his leg broken, and a lighter-keeper sustaining injuries to his face. The Rinaldo being secured to strong moorings was able to ride out the storm. If the weather does not at once abate it will become impossible to take advantage of the high tides of this month. The wreck has already been swept with four 8 inch wire hawsers, and all the toggles intended to be used, numbering about 18, have been introduced into the ports, so that only the toggles have to be shackled, the hawsers jewelled, and the fore and mizen masts removed preparatory to the attempt to float the Eurydice, which, with favourable weather, has been fixed for Sunday or Monday.

THE EURYDICE.

Conettnnom eyries Imo torra—On Wednesday last Mr. Edgar tioble, one of the coroners for Dante, teaclothsl the inquiries into the death of the unfortunate men drowned in the Eurydice. The evhleneo sem confined to that of the survivors, Cuddiford and the boy Sydney Fletcher. There narratives were subetantially the samosa the admitted by them at previous inquiries. Some new facts, however, were Avowed. Clekliferd stated that there was not the slightest ioditation of the spoilt rowing on before the Ship stank, and he did not thiult the wind headed her during the whole time. To the lust the captain mire his orders in a clear and distinct voice, and at the time the ship went down all the ports were open ex c ept tan. They were owned in the forenoon by the acres of the mate of the deck, and the ship at the time she struck was going at about eight knots. From the time the order wax given to ehorten sail to the time she heeled over about six minutes elapsed. From the :hue she heeled over to going down was only a minute, The captain was on deck the whole of the afternoon, and iu witness's opinion everp bite: was done to save the ship. He believed that none of the four guns broke loose. The ship was more lively than usual from the amount of water and provisions but if they had commuted all the water the ship would have been properly ballasted. lie did not believe that Captain Hare was aware that the ports were open. Considering the state of the weather be wane( opinion that the ship was in a wife condition. She was not under too great a prect of trail previous to the storm. Mr. (Afford, a sub-lieutenant, was at the wheel, but there was always a quartermaster there. As a seaman of 21 pars' e xperience, he believed that no blame attached to either officers or men for the loss of the ship. The Coroner, in concluding the inquiry, said the Admiralty did not propose to offer any scientific evidence. It would be for the jury to my whether the captain had caused a proper look-out to kept, because if he had nut it would amount to a neglect of duty, for which he would have had to answer had ho survived. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased came to their deaths by drowning through the foundering of the Eurydice, but that no blame attached to the captain, fficers. or crew. Another body has been recovered from the wreck—that of C. Wilkins, one of the crew, found found in the forechains. In opening the en: quiry, the Coroner (E. Goble, Esq.) observed that the body upon which evidence would be given was supposed to be orte of the crew, of the Eurydice, and his clothes were marked "C. Wilkins." It would be the duty of the jury to ins nine whether the indentity of the deceased' had been proved to their satisfaction, and also to ascertain the cause of death. It was nut his intention at present to go into any further in. quiry. They haul received the verdict of two juries with regard to this catastrophe, and therefore all they need now do was to prove the identity of the body and find the comet of &nth. eiterge foreman of the laborers at the Hospital, said the body was brought to the ads petal thattlay by some laborers of the Dockyard.

During the last few days of fine weather co, .iderable rrogress has been made at the wreck, hoth the wizen and fore masts having been pulled out by the tugs and a spaee cleared for the attachment of the lifting ships.

Many inn varied are the opinions as to the easee of the melaneholy disaster, and it is some satisfaction—mournful it is true—to know that in the opinion of the jury which has enquired into the loss of the Eurydice. the disaster was the result of an accideut and no blame can be attached to the captain or any of the officers or men under him. It was the first thought that the vessel under too great a press of canvas, seeing what the weather was before the squall came on; but the evidence showed that there were two watches, with at least a hundred men in each, that the watch on the deck at the time was plenty to manage the ship, and that had there been more men they would have been in each other's way.

Bow TO Rates VESSELS. — Writing with regard to the unsuccessful attempts to raise the Eq. !pike, a correspondent says :—.% few yours ago, the Workington, a full-rigged ship of 2,000 tons, laden with (vials, andou tire, was scuttled in the roads, and settled into soft mud, that her topsail yards were only visible above the water. She was bought bye French. man. He at once secured all her top-hamper for staging on which to erect purchases (and did not strip her, as the Eurydice was stripped) to discharge her cargo with and work his divers' pumps from. He had strong Pampero winds, and three or four knot currents to contend against ; however, by working both day and night, and in as bad and exposed position as though the ship had been off the lsle of Wight, he discharged all the cargo of coals, then commenced to fill the hold with wine casks, which were stored below by six divers. The casks had an inch hole bored in each head, then tilled with water and a long spigot placed in the holes, then slung in a chain lowered to the divers (the chains helping to sink the cask) and placed into position by them ; when there they had only to take out both plugs, insert the end of the air nozzle into one hole and blow the water out by the other, then pluugg them both up, when the cask would be tilled with air. Upon one calm day they thus placed 250 casks. They stuck to the job for nine weeks, and brought the ship out of her Led in which she had settled 13 feet deep into the harbour. The tremendous force of the united efforts of the casks had burst her upper deek and so strained her deck beams that they had to be taken out and repaired. The ship, under the name of Perteno, is now afloat, and has made many profitable voyages for her owner. Now, the divers told no they experienced no difficulty while working in the hold from current or rough water. but were only troubled by the darkness and the slippery settlements left on all footing by the sand delimits, of which the hold had at least fifty tons, and this had to be lifted with the iron hull of the ship, iron lower masts, bowsprit, lower yards, and all deckgear. lu another case a wooden brig was cut down by a steamer to the water's edge, and was treated in a like manner, only that the immense hole in her aide had to le planked and covered with canvas. She was succeed- Wily brought into harbour, although seven tailed outside when she went down, and in the channel where the whole force of the river is constantly running at tour to fourandsa-half knots, and not three days without a blow more or less severe.

THE EURYDICE.

In the House of Commons on Monday, Mr. David Jenkins said I wish to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty when it is intended to hold a naval inquiry into the loss of her Majesty's ship Eurydice; how it is proposed that the court should be constituted ; and whether he has considered if it would be advantageous to the public service that one or two experts, other than officers in her Majesty's navy, should form part of the oourt : and, whether he inform the House what weight of ballast was put on board when this ship was last commissioned, and of what it consisted; if the water in tanks or any portion of the other stores was relied upon to ensure her stability ; and, if so, what were the nature and weight of such stores.

Mr. W. H. Smith said the court-martial, in accordance with the Navy Discipline Act, has been delayed simply for the purpose of obtaining some valuable evidence as to the condition of the ship before she sank, which it was expected would be forthcoming when the ship was raised. The Board do not permit experts to be placed upon the court, but the court can call any one they choose in order to obtain evidence. The weight of iron ballast the Eurydice carried was 30 tons, the same as she carried previously. As to the last part of the second question, namely, that with reference to water ballast and stores, that will be the subject of inquiry before the court, and it is one to which I cannot give an answer.

Mr. D. Jenkins gave notice that on a future day he should call attention to the subject.

Mr. Baillie Cochrane. M.P. for the Isle of Wight, also asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether, as it seemed impossible to raise the Eurydice, it would not be better to place a buoy over the place where she lies, with some memorial of the gallant men who perished there.

Mr. W. H. Smith : It is not considered to be impossible to raise the ship, and further attempts will he made to do so next spring tides, if the weather permits. To place a buoy over the wreck permanently would be a serious obstruction to navigation. (Hear, hear.)

The salvage operations at the wreck have made considerable progress, favored by a continuance of fine weather, and from Monday till Friday the divers will only be engaged in cutting away such running gear as would be likely to drag on the ground when the ship is raised. The Eurydice has now been swept with four 8-inch steel hawsers, and heavy toggles, with double wire strops, have been introduced into the ports. To these strops 1? inch chain pendants have been shackled on, and when the lift is given the ends of these will be in the mooring lighters. In addition to the 8-inch wire ropes, the bight of an 8-inch wire rope has been dropped before the mainmast into the gangway ports, and the ends poised aft under each quarter have been centred or feilddled under the stern, and will be taken in by the Pearl. In addition to her 8-inch hawsers, the Rinaldo will have the two fore ends of the inch hawser. The Wave and Swan are ready for their work. These two ships will take in as many of the toggle pendants as the ships will ride ever, and all the ships will previously have been sunk three or four feet by allowing that amount of water in them, which will be discharged by powerful steam pumps so soon as the ships have been hove down to the wreck. The Popoff air bag has been placed on the weather side in the gangway and successfully inflated, and the divers have carefully inspected all the toggles and hawsers now they are in position, and report them to be fixed satisfactorily. On Saturday a beautiful inkstand belonging to Captain Hare was recovered by one of the divers, and also a signal log, two white ensigns, and an Italian ensign, all four being unserviceable. On Saturday evening the whole of the divers, riggers and camber men were brought in from the wreck, having succeeded in completing the necessary preliminary arrangements. On Saturday next 400 hands will be taken out to the wreck for the purpose of tightening up the gear and fixing the purchases, and on Monday and Tuesday next, when the tides will have increased upwards of two feet in rise, the first lift will be made. Should the operators succeed in getting the ship out of the hole in which she lies embedded, the lifting vessels, which will be in the first instance placed across the wreck and immersed some two feet, so as to secure an additional rise as the water is pumped out, will then be fastened alongside, and the process repeated until the ports of the Eurydice have been brought above the water level.

The Eurydice.

Mr. Jabiz Hughes has obtained some really remarkable views of the wrecked Eurydice as she lies of St. Helen's. The great defect in all the photos hitherto obtained is that they are taken from so great a distance that the wrecked ship bears but an insignificant part in the general view. Mr. Hughes appears to have taken his picture instantaneously from some boat close to the wreck, the position of the ship being accurately shown, as well as the men on her deck searching for the bodies, &c. The photographs are printed by the permanent process.

THE EURYDICE.

The unexpected delay which has occurred connection with the raising of the has, it is stated, evoked strong expression of dissatisfaction from the Admiralty, and it has been deemed advisable to call in aid the advice and assistance of the constructors' department Portsmouth dockyard. The divers went out to the scene the wreck of the Eurydice yesterday morning, and from the activity shown the Government officials it was thought that the vessel would be moved. About eleven o'clock, however, strong breeze set from the north-west, and the divers came ashore about noon, without attempting descend to the wreck.

The Diving at the Wreck of the Eurydice.

With reference to the amount paid to the divers in connection with the raising of the Eurydice, Messrs. Siebe and Gorman, submarine engineers to the Royal Navy, write that they had four men engaged at the wreck, and not three, as stated, and that it was only their foreman diver who received £1 5s. per tide. During the four months that operations were carried on the men were working day and night, and the pay they received was in the aggregate the same as that of the dockyard divers.

H.M.S. Atalanta.

Two hundred pinds offered by the Admiralty as a reward for any one giving definite information as to the cause or the locality of the loss of the missing training ship will be regarded by the relatives and friends of the poor fellows on hoard as an indication that there is no longer room for the slightest doubt as to the dreadful nature of the catastrophe. Even the official mind, which is slow to admit the occurrence of events prejudicial to itself, by the issue of this notice reluctantly places upon record the fact that the last gleam of hope for the safety of the ship and her precious cargo of human lives has vanished. It is now a melancholy certainty that the ship which was sent to sea by the Admiralty in the place of the Eurydice has met with a precisely similar fate — that she has been blown over and swalowed up by the pitiless waves, and that at one fell swoop has the desolation of death been carried to over three hundred homes. The country from end to end is thrilled with horror by this terrible calamity, and already the demand has gone forth that the Admiralty itself shall be placed upon its trial in order to the prevention of the recurrence of such woful mishaps. Although the reward of £250 has been offered, we much doubt whether we shall ever obtain reliable information as to the exact spot, or the time, or the method of the foundering. There is no doubt but that she went down carrying with her every trace of the accident, and whatever wreckage may be thrown up hereafter will have travelled so far in deep sea currents as to be valueless save as mementoes of the dead, The disaster is so awfully dreadful that it is impossible as yet to think or to write of it with calmness.

THE ATALANTA.

*The Brighton Gazette* of Thursday is responsible for a somewhat extraordinary statement concerning the missing training-ship Atalanta. It says : "We have special information from an authentic source that so long ago as the 4th of May a sailor of the mercantile marine, whose name is known, and who has been sometime in Newhaven and Brighton, communicated direct to the Admiralty full particulars, or at least the means of obtaining full particulars, and giving the reason why he was unable or afraid to come forward in the matter himself. This communication seems to have been ignored, and on the 12th or 13th he wrote again, saying he knew what certain parties were making out of the retention of the facts, and that he thought it wrong they should be longer withheld. This was again ignored, but the next day or so the Admiralty sent a letter for insertion in the daily papers, saying that they thought all hope of the Atalanta must now be abandoned!" The journal suggests that the offer of a reward was probably made with the view of inducing the man to come forward, but the same influence which prevented his coming forward in the first instance will probably have the same effect now. The *Gazette* concludes with a significant remark. It says : "When we add the fact, which is beyond all doubt — that during the present week certain not obscure persons, both in Brighton and London, have had in their hands a chart 'lined ' and marked with minute details of the Atalanta, at a date since any official or other information can be obtained of her, or is ever likely to be, we think we are justified in saying a very great mystery surrounds the whole matter, and that our information is special and extraordinary."

Mr. Edward H. Capper, of Cardiff, in discussing the loss of the Atalanta, calls attention to the suggestion frequently made that she may have capsized like the Eurydice. He points out that the Eurydice did not capsize, but foundered because when lying over heavily under a press of canvas she filled through her lee ports, which were open. He adds that he was never in any ship which would not have done the same.

The Secretary of the Royal Naval School, New Cross, writes : " I have the pleasure to acquaint you that at a meeting of the Council of the Royal Naval School, held at New Cross, on Tuesday, I was directed at once to ascertain the number of children of officers of ward-room rank left fatherless by this sad calamity, with a view to receiving their sons into this school on such terms as the circumstances in each case may render necessary."

In the history of lost vessels probably the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty never took so much trouble to obtain intelligence as in the case of the missing Atalanta. In prosecuting enquiries, letters have been addressed to the following maritime nations, requesting that captains of vessels should be instructed to keep a look-out for ahy trace of the missing ship: France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austro-Hungary, Greece, Chili, and the United States of America. The foregoing Powers are those who have recently combined with England in a new and important system of international ocean signalling. The ready acquiescence manifested by all the maritime governments of the earth makes it evident that there is a world-wide sympathy with England, and an anxiety to aid in ascertaining the fate of those 300 youths whose disappearance is at present involved in mystery. At tbe present time there must be some thousands of vessels on the watch.

THE ATALANTA DISASTER.—

The Plover, gun boat, Commander Steward, as to whose safety there were serious misgivings until intimation of her arrival at Vigo was received, reached Spithead on Wednesday morning with five ordinary seaman who belonged to the Atalanta, but who, happily for themselves, did not take passage in her when she left Bermuda. These and an ordinary seaman named Varling are all who remain of the crew, and they will, it is understood, be examined by the Court appointed to investigate the circumstances connected with the disappearance of the vessel. The men give the Atalanta a very bad character.
