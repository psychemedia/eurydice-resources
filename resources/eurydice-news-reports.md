The major closure of Brading Haven to form what is now known as Bembridge Harbour was started in 1874 and finally finished, after several abortive attempts, in 1880. After this work was completed the ownership of the Harbour passed into the hands of the local railway company. It passed to the Southern Railway after the First World War and then British Railways following nationalisation. It eventually passed back into private hands in 1968.

In 1864, the Bembridge Railway, Tramway and Pier Act was passed by Parliament, authorising the construction of land-reclamation works and the building of a pier. By 1878 over 800 acres of land were reclaimed, and a pier built. Bembridge Harbour Pier was only 250ft long, and quite narrow too. Despite this, it was used by ships such as the 46 tonnes Tynemouth, and after the harbour had been dredged to allow larger ships, such as the 125ft. Island Queen in 1878 and in 1892 the 104 tonnes, 137ft paddle steamer Princess of Wales, which was re-named the Bembridge. This was run by the Southsea and Ventnor Steamship Company. This later merged with the Southsea, Ventnor, Shanklin and Sandown Steamship Company to become the Bembridge and Seaview Steamship Company in 1912. Ships which called at Bembridge regularly on a passenger service included the Sandringham, Prince, Duke of York, Carrier and the 130ft Lord Kitchener. The largest ferry was the Alexandra in 1913, which was a 235-tonne ship and 171ft long.

SHANKLIN RIOTS.

The Electors of Shanklin are requested to read the undermentioned facts: 1. That on the 17th day of March, a meeting of Mr. Cotton's constituents was held in the Assembly Rooms, in Shanklin, and a large number of Mr. Ashley's supporters attended the meeting and prevented Mr. Cotton and other speakers from being heard, by hooting, yelling, and creating a disturbance throughout the whole of the proceedings ; and it was evident that it was the predetermined intention of Mr. Ashley's supporters to prevent Mr. Cotton having a hearing, and not to treat him with the respect which candidates have a right to expect from their audience on such occasions. 2. That a few nights after the meeting the glass in the house and conservatory of Mr. Coster, a gentleman of Conservative principles, were smashed, that gentleman being absent from the Island at the time. 3. A meeting of Mr. Ashley's supporters was held on the 2nd of April, and at which meeting the supporters of Mr. Cotton from Ventnor, Sandown, St. Helen's, and other places were present, the men from St. Helen's being chiefly of the labouring classes ; they arrived at Shanklin two hours previous to the meeting, in the open day ; this fact was well known to Mr. Ashley's committee, and no communication as to the presence of these men or their attendance at the meeting was made to Mr. Cotton's committee. The men behaved themselves respectably and orderly prior to their going to the meeting, and when in the hall had no weapons, nor appeared to be prepared for a disturbance, but, on the contrary, the sup- porters of Mr. Ashley appeared in the hall armed with bludgeons, short lengths of gas pipe, and other dangerous weapons, and evidently intent upon creating a serious riot. 4. That about 7.30, as Mr. Dampier-Child approached the Institute, he met a crowd of disorderly people, and was struck on the head by a missile. He went to Capt. Harvey's house to warn him that a disturbance was likely to take place. Capt. Harvey, not supposing a disturbance was likely to occur, persuaded Mr. Dampier-Child to accompany him and another gentleman to Mr. Cotton s committee rooms. Just prior to arriving there they were surrounded and attacked by a mob of over 1 00 persons, residents of Shanklin, who threatened to take their lives. Mr. Dampier-Child and the other gentleman were knocked down and kicked senseless whilst ou the ground, and Capt. Harvey escaped from the crowd after being severely handled and receiving some heavy blows. It must be distinctly understood this riot took place before the time fixed for Mr. Ashley's meeting, and that this mob of Mr. Ashley's supporters had some time previously assembled, armed as before mentioned, with the intention ot creating a most serious riot. 5. That, in consequence of this not, many supporters of Mr. Ashley advised Col. Atherley, the Chairman, not to hold a meeting that night, for if he did serious consequences would ensue ; but eventually, about 8.30, the doors were opened, and it is certain that by this time the men from St. Helen's had heard of the riot out of doors, and that one of the gentlemen who had been seriously injured in the riot was oue who was much respected amongst them. 6. That as soon as Col. Atherley appeared interruptions took place, by singing. A gentleman, also much respected by the St. Helen's men, got up in a chair and informed Col. Atherley that if he would withdraw he thought he could obtain a quiet bearing for Mr. Ashley, the gentleman's chair was immediately whipped from under him, and he was thrown on the floor by some of Mr. Ashley's supporters. He got up again to carry his intention, the chair was again whipped from under him; and this time a most dangerous wound was inflicted on his head by some supporter of Mr. Ashley striking him from behind. Hereupon a riot ensued, but how long it continued the committee are not aware. The St. Helen's men were met by several persons leaving Shanklin, about 9 o'clock, in an orderly manner, not offending any one, and, so far as Mr. Cotton's committee can learn, no damage was done to the person or property of any one in Shanklin by Mr. Cotton's supporters; whilst on the other hand, four gentle- men were assaulted and three of them seriously injured by cowardly attacks from Mr. Ashley's mob, who continued to do injury to property by breaking windows, &c., until after midnight. The Committee offer these facts to the inhabitants of Shanklin and of the Isle of Wight generally, without any comment. H. HARRIS, Chairman, Mr. Cotton's Committee, Shanklin

ANSWER TO THE CHARGE OF TORY RUFFIANISM IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

A True Account of the late Riot at Shanklin from ihe commencement. It will be remembered that a short time since, Mr. B. T. Cotton held a meeting at Shanklin, and attempted to deliver an address to the electors, but the disturbance in the Hall was so great that he was unable to obtain a hearing, one of the ringleaders of the disturbance being the servant of Col. Atherley. On Friday last, a meeting was announced by the Hon. Evelyn Ashley, to be given at Shanklin, when doubtless bearing in mind the reception given to Mr. Cotton, by the Liberals, some of tne Conservatives, aa private individuals, and not by the instructions of any person, determined to give the would- be Liberal member and the gallant Colonel a similar reception to Mr. Cotton's. Thus far the cause of the Tories assembling is shewn, but the pamphlet which has been extensively circulated purporting to have been written by " One who was there," relates nothing of the rioting which took place before the meeting commenced. The electors shall bo shown how the gentle Shanklin Liberals treated gentle- men as they were quietly walking through the streets. Mr. Latimer Saunders, Captain Harvey, and Mr. Dampier Child were walking through the High-street of Shanklin, about an hour before the Liberal meeting commenced, when they were set upon by a party of Liberal roughs and knocked down. Mr. L. Saunders had two teeth knocked out ; Mr. Dampier Child a rib broken, and all three gentlemen were severely bruised all over their bodies. I shall say nothing about the damage committed on Capt. Harvey's house and property, or the serious assault perpetrated on him, as I saw nothing of the matter, but will give you aa account of the meeting. On the doors of the Hall being opened, the front seats were taken by about twenty respectable youag men belonging to Ryde ; these were followed by a number of Shanklin men, all of them having sticks in their hands, with the exception of one, he evideatly;ieader of the Shanklin party, and well known to the Ryde men, haying formerly been employed in Ryde, was armed with a piece of Iron, it having the appearance of having been cut off a gas pipe. After these had been in the Hall a little while, a tremendous cheering was heard outside, and the so-called " gang of hired ruffians " made their appearance. Of course a scene of considerable confusion ensued for some time, the Liberals cheering Ashley, and the Conservative giving cheers for Cotton, interspersed with cries of " Who sacked the Bobby!''" After this had continued for some time a message was seat from the platform to Mr. R. Seymour, asking him if he could quiet his men, the reply was sent back that if the Chairman would allow him to speak from the platform where he could be seen and heard, he would do his best to quiet the men. This very reasonable request was refused. Mr. Seymour then attempted to gain the men's attention by standing on a chair, when before he could address them the chair was pulled from under him, when of course he fell on the floor. (About this time Mr. Ashley and the Chairman left the Hall.) Mr. Seymour no way daunted by his futile effort to gain a hearing, stood upon another chair and again tried to quiet the men, and again the chair was pulled from under him, this time causing him to fall on his head. This was the signal for the rioting inside the Hall to commence, the person who pulled the chair away being levelled by a chair striking him on the head. A tall dark gentleman then sprang from the platform and commenced striking among the navvies right and left. Of course this was not borne with very long, one of them behind rushing to the front and seizing the striker, forced the stick from him and paid him back in his own coin. A general fight now ensued, the navvies being without any weapons but those with which nature had provided tham, breaking un the chairs in the Hall and thereby obtaining some. I think this will do away with the assertion of '" One who was there," that the navvies were armed with bars of iron and bludgeons, for if they had had these weapons there would have been no need for them to have taken the trouble to break up the chairs to arm themselves with. I left the Hall upon seeing the fight that was going on, and joined a crowd of about five hund-ed people who were assembled outside. I had been there about five minutes when the leader of the Shanklin roughs with his bar of iron in his hand appeared on the steps, wildly waving his arms, and shouting "All Shanklin men inside." As no one responded to this call I suppose all the Shanklin men were inside, or else that there were no men in Shanklin. Of course when the navvies came out of the Hall they presented a somewhat different appearance to what they did when they entered it each one being armed with the leg or some portion of a chair, so I suppose they had left their bars of iron and bludgeons behind them. No doubt they may have had some drink before entering, and also upon leavin- the Hall, but it was in the same way as the writer of this had it, and that was by paying for it from their own pockets; they were perfectly sober. The last I saw of the navvies they were marching on the Sandown-road with a crowd keeping at a respectable distance, pelting them with stones. Of course the heads of the Liberal party will try to make capital out of this affair, but there is not the slightest doubt that if Mr. Seymour had not been assaulted there would have been no riot.

Isle of Wight Railway.

The policy of the directors ahd managers of this undertaking in making Brading harbour their port for the east coast of the Island seems likely to become great success. Although the accommodation and conveniences there are not yet complete, the coasting trade is already beginning to appreciate and avail itself of the advantages which the safe and facile harbour affords over the open roadstead of Ryde. It is said that the masters of the small craft allege that a freight of 8s. 6d. a ton to Brading quay is more profitable than 10s. 6d. to Ryde with the delays and risk of beaching there, and the difference will enable the company to reduce the current prices at Ryde to some extent, a benefit to the town at large and a relief from the unsightly mode at present adopted of carting coals and goods through the water and across our beautiful Esplanade. We learn that last week less than tons of coal, iron pipes, corn, and other heavy goods were landed at the Brading jetty at once from the vessels' holds into the railway trucks and distributed to the various stations on the line. Considering the incomplete state of the line and the novelty of the change this is a great beginning, and the sight of 26 loaded wagons in a single train appeared to astonish the natives. Feeling satisfied that anything which cheapens the carriage to Ryde must be an immense benefit to us, we hail with pleasure this improved communication, and trust that the greater improvements which will undoubtedly follow may further enhance the value of the connection to the public of Ryde, while it must increase the profits of the proprietors of the line.

BRADING.

Brading Harbour is assuming a very animated appearance. The branch line of the Isle of Wight Railway is completed, quite down to the side of the water, so that the trucks can load and unload from and into the vessels without any break. This, no doubt, will be of great advantage, not only to this, but also to other parts of the Island, and will in the course of time be *the* port of the Island. In one commodity already we begin to perceive a difference—viz., coals. Hitherto there has been quite a monopoly in that article, which no doubt now will speedliy be broken up.

Brading court leet

THE “OVEHN VENT ENQUIRY. —The long-expected Government enquiry in connection with the Brading Court Leet has at last been definitely fixed. We need scarcely impress upon the inhabitants of Brading the importance of the Commission which will settle for many-future generations what the form of local government shall be in one of the oldest of English Corporations. That the Court Leet in its present form is doomed, that almost its last "Mayor" has been elected, and its last public dinner eaten, may be taken for granted; and unless some strong and urgent reasons can be shown to the contrary, the town itself and its property will be handed over to the hands of others to govern, who, residing elsewhere, will know nothing of its requirements. All therefore who can should be present and support those who advocate a local government on a reformed basis, and not an alteration that will take from those most interested all rit and power to govern themselves.

H.M.S. Atalanta.

Two hundred pounds offered by the Admiralty as a reward for any one giving definite information as to the cause or the locality of the loss of the missing training ship will be regarded by the relatives and friends of the poor fellows on hoard as an indication that there is no longer room for the slightest doubt as to the dreadful nature of the catastrophe. Even the official mind, which is slow to admit the occurrence of events prejudicial to itself, by the issue of this notice reluctantly places upon record the fact that the last gleam of hope for the safety of the ship and her precious cargo of human lives has vanished. It is now a melancholy certainty that the ship which was sent to sea by the Admiralty in the place of the Eurydice has met with a precisely similar fate — that she has been blown over and swalowed up by the pitiless waves, and that at one fell swoop has the desolation of death been carried to over three hundred homes. The country from end to end is thrilled with horror by this terrible calamity, and already the demand has gone forth that the Admiralty itself shall be placed upon its trial in order to the prevention of the recurrence of such woful mishaps. Although the reward of £250 has been offered, we much doubt whether we shall ever obtain reliable information as to the exact spot, or the time, or the method of the foundering. There is no doubt but that she went down carrying with her every trace of the accident, and whatever wreckage may be thrown up hereafter will have travelled so far in deep sea currents as to be valueless save as mementoes of the dead, The disaster is so awfully dreadful that it is impossible as yet to think or to write of it with calmness.

THE ATALANTA.

*The Brighton Gazette* of Thursday is responsible for a somewhat extraordinary statement concerning the missing training-ship Atalanta. It says : "We have special information from an authentic source that so long ago as the 4th of May a sailor of the mercantile marine, whose name is known, and who has been sometime in Newhaven and Brighton, communicated direct to the Admiralty full particulars, or at least the means of obtaining full particulars, and giving the reason why he was unable or afraid to come forward in the matter himself. This communication seems to have been ignored, and on the 12th or 13th he wrote again, saying he knew what certain parties were making out of the retention of the facts, and that he thought it wrong they should be longer withheld. This was again ignored, but the next day or so the Admiralty sent a letter for insertion in the daily papers, saying that they thought all hope of the Atalanta must now be abandoned!" The journal suggests that the offer of a reward was probably made with the view of inducing the man to come forward, but the same influence which prevented his coming forward in the first instance will probably have the same effect now. The *Gazette* concludes with a significant remark. It says : "When we add the fact, which is beyond all doubt — that during the present week certain not obscure persons, both in Brighton and London, have had in their hands a chart 'lined ' and marked with minute details of the Atalanta, at a date since any official or other information can be obtained of her, or is ever likely to be, we think we are justified in saying a very great mystery surrounds the whole matter, and that our information is special and extraordinary."

Mr. Edward H. Capper, of Cardiff, in discussing the loss of the Atalanta, calls attention to the suggestion frequently made that she may have capsized like the Eurydice. He points out that the Eurydice did not capsize, but foundered because when lying over heavily under a press of canvas she filled through her lee ports, which were open. He adds that he was never in any ship which would not have done the same.

The Secretary of the Royal Naval School, New Cross, writes : " I have the pleasure to acquaint you that at a meeting of the Council of the Royal Naval School, held at New Cross, on Tuesday, I was directed at once to ascertain the number of children of officers of ward-room rank left fatherless by this sad calamity, with a view to receiving their sons into this school on such terms as the circumstances in each case may render necessary."

In the history of lost vessels probably the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty never took so much trouble to obtain intelligence as in the case of the missing Atalanta. In prosecuting enquiries, letters have been addressed to the following maritime nations, requesting that captains of vessels should be instructed to keep a look-out for ahy trace of the missing ship: France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austro-Hungary, Greece, Chili, and the United States of America. The foregoing Powers are those who have recently combined with England in a new and important system of international ocean signalling. The ready acquiescence manifested by all the maritime governments of the earth makes it evident that there is a world-wide sympathy with England, and an anxiety to aid in ascertaining the fate of those 300 youths whose disappearance is at present involved in mystery. At the present time there must be some thousands of vessels on the watch.

THE ATALANTA DISASTER.—

The Plover, gun boat, Commander Steward, as to whose safety there were serious misgivings until intimation of her arrival at Vigo was received, reached Spithead on Wednesday morning with five ordinary seaman who belonged to the Atalanta, but who, happily for themselves, did not take passage in her when she left Bermuda. These and an ordinary seaman named Varling are all who remain of the crew, and they will, it is understood, be examined by the Court appointed to investigate the circumstances connected with the disappearance of the vessel. The men give the Atalanta a very bad character.
