THE CHIEF CONSTRUCTOR ON THE EURYDICE, &c.—

The chief constructor of the Dockyard (Mr. W. B. Robinson), addressing the members of the Literary and Scientific Society, lat week, said that non-attention to science was sure to lead to failure, and sometimes to catastrophe. The capsising of H.H.S. Captain would have been prevented had the officer in command read an article previously written by the present member for Pembroke. That article would have taught him the folly of carrying sail on the ship under the circumstances it was carried when she went down. There was a more recent catastrophe which he would not discuss, but he very much regretted— and it was common enough to regret— that science had not been called in for more than four weeks to devise the best means of raising the Eurydice. It was essential that a man should know enough of ordinary things in a scientific manner, in order to foresee what was likely to happen. The President (Mr. J. Douglas) remarked that it was a disgrace to engineering men that that vessel should remain unraised, and the scandal was the greater that Captain Coppin, of the Steam Salvage Company, offered to raise the Eurydice immediately afer the disaster, but received no reply for nearly a fortnight, when his offer was declined with thanks. As he understood, Captain Coppin had afterwards offered to bring up the bodies from the ship, but this offer was also declined.

OPENING OF THE NEW PIER.

Sandown was en fete on Wednesday, the day fixed for the opening of the new pier, and every one seemed impressed with the fact that the event was one of no ordinary importance in the history of the little town. Lady Oglander very kindly consented to perform the opening ceremony, but so unpropitious was the weather at the beginning of the day that for some time it was doubtful whether a postponement would not be necessary. The rain fell all the morning without ceasing, and of course made the roads in the neighbourhood of the pier dirty and muddy ; but, as the hour fixed for the ceremony approached, the sky commenced clearing, and by 3 o'clock it was tolerably fine. A considerable number of persona then began to flock to the pier, the approaches to which were decorated with banners and flags. Across the street which Lady Oglander would have to pass was stretched a banner, bearing the arms of the Oglander family and the motto "Server Munia Vitae," on each side of which was the word " Welcome." Above the street leading to the pier was a banner bearing the words "Success to the Pier," and over the pier gates another, bidding all " Welcome." There was also plenty of bunting about, a number of poles being placed at regular intervals on both sides of the pier, and each carrying a gay flag. With respect to the pier itself, which next claims our notice, it must not be understood that it is actually finished. Only a portion of the structure — half the total length contemplated — is finished, but of course this is sufficient to give a good idea of its general effect, and makes a very nice promenade. Unlike the piers we have seen elsewhere, the seats run down the whole length. From the pierhead can be obtained capital views, not only seaward but of the cliffs, sands, and general scenery of the interior of the Island. The pier looks a very light structure — uncomfortably so, in fact. The iron piles on which it rests are so slight, and their distance one from the other is so great, as to lead one to doubt whether it will be found sufficiently strong to withstand the winter waves which roll into the bay. This uncomfortable feeling was intensified by the appearance of a wreck close at hand — the John Douse— highly suggestive of the stormy waters which the structure will have to withstand ; while further out to sea, and almost in line with the head of the pier, was another dismal sight — the masts of the wreck of the Eurydice, still beneath the waters, and still holding many a score of the bodies of brave young tars. These were two things highly suggestive of what the winds and waves can do about here. We suppose, however, that the lightness of the pier just at the parts which are finished does not matter, and doubtless the structure will be made more substantial as it reaches that portion of the shore where the full fury of the waves will be encountered. However, a pier seems to be a necessity for Sandown, and we congratulate the inhabitants of the little town upon their energy and evident determination to improve the place.

THE OPENING CEREMONY.

Shortly after 4 o'clock the townspeople began to flock to the pier. A number of the members of the Nunwell Volunteers were drawn up on each side of the pier gates, as a sort of guard of honour, under the command of their popular young captain (A. Brook Leeds, Esq.) and Lieut Pound, while the band was stationed at the end of the pier to add harmony to the proceedings. Amongst those assembled at the pier gates to welcome Lady Oglander on her arrival were F. Pittis, Esq. (Mayor of Newport), Col. Currie (chairman of the Ventnor Local Board), Mr. Walter Mew (chairman of the Sandown Local Board), W. H. Wooldridge, Esq (clerk to the Local Board), Mr. Eldridge (town clerk of Newport), the Rev. W. M. Harrison, Dampier Child, Esq , and the following members of the Sandown Local Board : Dr. Bulbeck, Messrs. Linfield, Love, J. K. Hollis, Warne, Pelley, and Box. Lady Oglander arrived punctually at the time fixed, accompanied by Major Leeds, and on alighting from her carriage was received by Mr. Wooldridge, who introduced the Chairman and members of the Sandown Local Board to her ladyship. Mr. Walter Mew (chairman) then stepped forward and presented her ladyship with an address from the Board. In doing so he expressed the great pleasure he felt in seeing her ladyship present, and thanked her for the interest she had always taken in Sandown, at the same time expressing the hope that she would long be spared to them. Mr. Wooldridge then read the address, which was handsomely engrossed on vellum, and signed by 155 ratepayers and inhabitants of the district. It was as follows :

To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Park, Isle of Wight.  
Madam, — We, the Local Board of the district of Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, and the undersigned ratepayers and inhabitants of the district, beg respectfully to express the great pleasure and gratification which it gives us to see your ladyship taking part in, and inaugurating the opening of a Pier in Sandown. We are well assured that your ladyship at all times takes an interest in all ,atters connected with the public welfare of Sandown and its inhabitants ; knowing, as we do, the readiness and liberality with which you have always contributed and assisted all charitable, and other local undertakings, we trust that your ladyship may long be spared and be able to assist, and participate in all public enterprises which may conduce to the prosperity of the town of Sandown, in which, as Lady of the Manor, we feel sure you will always have a deep and sincere interest. With every expression of respect and esteem,  
We are, your ladyship's faithful servants,  
Walter Mew, Chairman.

The Common Seal of the Local Board of Sandown was affixed, this 27th day of May, 1873, in pursuance of a resolution unanimously passed at a special meeting, held on the 24th day of May, 1878, in the presence of Mr. H. Wooldridge, clerk to the Board.

Leaning on the arm of Major Leeds, her ladyship then walked to the end of the pier, which had been carpeted for the occasion. Here she was introduced to the chairman and directors of the Pier Company. Her ladyship having briefly declared the pier open, Mr. Jonathan Jolliffe, the chairman of the company, stepped forward and presented her ladyship with another address. He explained that the company had a hard struggle to get the pier completed so far, but they hoped to be able to make the structure double its present length, and to place a lifeboat at the end. It would then be very useful for yachts and steamers, which would be able to land passengers here. He then presented the address, which was also engrossed on vellum, and read as follows :

To Lady Oglander, Nunwell Ptrk. Isle of Wight.  
Madam, — The chairman and directors of the Sandown Pier Company beg to welcome your ladyship on this, to them, important occasion, and at the same time express their sincere thanks for your kindness in consenting to preside at the opening of the pier. It is only after having overcome many difficulties, and even local opposition, that the directors have at length succeeded im completiing the first section of the pier, so as to permit the same to be opened for the use of the public. However, they hope to receive such pecuniary assistance from residents, owners of property, and others interested in the welfare of Sandown, as may enable them to complete the original design, and carry out the pier to its full lengih of 650 feet, being nearly double the length of the portion already constructed, and so kindly opened by your ladyship. — The directors are sure that the pier will atford a pleasant and agreeable promenade, and prove a source of attraction to the town of Sandowm and its visitors; and they venture also to hope that it may ultimately prove useful, not only for purposes of recreation, but also a station from which a lifeboat may bo launched. Recent sad events that have taken place in the bay deepen the conviction that Sandown will prove a most important station for a lifeboat. For the carrying out so laudable an object the directors can only trust to the liberality and sympathy of the public generally.— Again thanking your ladyship tor the kind interest you have shown in the work the directors have in hand by your presence here to-day, and with every good wish for your welfare and happiness,  
We beg to remain,  
Your ladyship's obedient and faithful servants  
Jonathan Joliffe,  
Richard Dampier Child,  
George Pelley,  
James Kennington.

The seal of the Sandown Pier Company (Limited) was affixed this 28th day of May, 1878, in pursuance of a resolution duly passed at a meeting of the directors im the presence of W. H. Wooldridge, secretary.

This portion of the ceremony concluded, Miss Brandt stepped forward, and, on behalf of the directors presented her ladyship with a very handsome bouquet. Her ladyship briefly replied as follows; "Mr , Chairman and gentleman of the Sandown Local Board and gentlemen of the Sandown Pier Company -I thank you very much for the kind and gratifying reception you have given me. It affords me at all times siccere pleasure to assist im any way in promoting the prosperity of Sandown, and I trust the undertakimg you have so successfully curried out and inaugurated this day may prove one of the many means of adding to the attractions of the place, and an additional source of health and enjoyment to visitors and inhabitants alike. " Hearty cheers were then given for hey ladyship, and a number of the gemtlement present having been introduced to her, the procession again went up the pier; her ladyship and Major Leeds re-entered their carringe, and drove off amidst the loud cheers of the assembled spectators. This concluded the ceremony, which was followed by

A BANQUET,

which took place at half-past 5, in the Town Hall, where about 70 gnntlemen sat down to the excellent repast provided. The chair was taken by Mr. Jon. Jolliffe, and the vice-chair by Mr. Walter Mew; : there being also present Capt. Brook Leeds, Lieut. Pound, Col. Currie, Rev. W. M. Harrison, Mr. W. H. Wooldridge, Col. Brandt, Mr. F. Pittis, Mr. F. Pittis, jun., Mr. T. H. Urry, Mr. W. H. Barton, Mr. C. G. Vincent, Dr. Meeres, Mr. Binns (engineer), Mr. D. Mitchell, Mr. Linfield, Mr. J. K. Hollis, Mr. L. H. Saunders, Mr. Theodore Saunders, &c. After the removal of the cloth,

Mr. Wooldridge read letters of apology from Mr. Baillie Cochrane, M.P. (who was unable to attend owing to the state of his health), the Mayors of Ryde, Yarmouth (I.W.) and Andover, Mr. F. White Popham, Col. Calthorpe, and others.

The Chairman briefly proposed the usual loyal toasts, which were heartily responded to. He then, proposed "The Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces," coupling with the toast the names of Col. Currie, Col. Brandt, and Capt. Brooke Leeds.

Col Currie congratulated those present upon adding a pier to the attractions of Sandown ; and then, speaking to the toast, said he had seen a great deal of war, and what he had aeen of its horrors led him to hope that peace would be maintained, and if it was maintained with honour to the country it would be the brightest star in the escutcheon of the noble lord who now presided over the destinies of the country (applause).

Col. Brandt, who also responded, was sure that in the present unfortunate discussion England would do her best to be on the right side, and should it end in war the Army, who had never yet been backward when called on, would do its best (applause). God forbid it should end in bloodshed, for he was sure no Englishman wished to see that ; all they wished was to see justice and right done (applause). If we did have a peace he hoped it would not be a patched-up peace, but that the question would now be so settled that there could be no chance of its being brought forward again (applause).

Capf. Brook* Leeds, in responding for the Volunteers, said that the corps he commanded owed a great deal to Sandown, and the numbers who had  joined them from that town enabled them to muster more strongly in proportion than the corps belonging to large and important towns. They would not be able to keep the corps up to this position without the help of Sandown. They had just drafted 15 Sandown men into the corps, and their band was composed five-tenths of Sandown men. Their corps then was virtually, except in name, a Sandown corps. The Volunteers as a body had no politics, and were always ready to do their duty if called on ; but they could not forget that, in spite of the many matters of importance which our present Government had to attend to, they had remembered the Volunteers. A Volunteer commission had been appointed to take into consideration the wants and requirements of the force. Although the Volunteers had their grant there were many other things required, which would no doubt be supplied (applause).

Mr. Dampier Child proposed "The Bishop and Clergy of the Diocese and the Ministers of all Denominations." In spite of certain difference* he thought the Church had the hearty good wishes of all true Englishmen. After regretting the absence of the Vicar, he coupled with the toast the names of the Rev. W. M. Harrison to respond for the Bishop and clergy, and the Rev. Mr. King for the ministers of other denominations.

The Rev. W. M. Harrison said he was extremely pleased to be present on such an auspicious day for Sandown, and he wished their new institution every success. Mr. Dampier Child had alluded to differences of opinion in the Church, but he asked where they did not find differences of opinion. It was so when he was a boy, and he supposed always would be so ; but he believed that, in spite of differences of opinion, his brethren of the Church and those amongst the Nonconformists were coming more into accord, and beginning to see that there was not such a great gulf between them but what they could shake hands ever it. He hoped they would give them credit for that, and would see that though they were parsons on Sunday they had their hearty sympathy on all occasions.

The Rev. Mr. King said he trusted that ministers of all denominations were beginning to see that they were building on one great foundation, and all endeavouring to inculcate one noble principle — good will towards men. He was very pleased to be present on such an occasion. Having been intimately associated with Sandown for a great number of years in greatly rejoiced him to see its increasing prosperity. He believed the construction of the new pier wonld prove a great thing for Sandown, and he hoped that, when completed, it would be crowned with success.

Mr. Pelley in eulogistic terms proposed the health of Lady Oglander, who always took such interest in the town, and had given £10 towards the expenses of the day (loud applause and cheers).

Capt. Leeds responded, and said he wished to tell them what Mr. Wooldridge evidently forgot, that his father, Major Leeds, was unable to be present, and had only been able to attend that afternoon at some risk to himself, for he was very far from well. He thanked them for the hearty way in which the toast was proposed and received. It was unnecessary for him to dilate on the kindness of Lady Oglander. One could not praise one's own relations very well, but he thought they would remember that it was a very difficult matter for any lady to take part in public matters. When, however, Lady Oglander was asked to open the pier, she at once complied, and although the day was not everything which wished, she came and went through the ceremony (applause). It was a pleasmre foe her to do anything to help Sandown. He then thanked them heartily on her behalf.

Mr. L. H. Saunders proposed " Success and Prosperity to the Sandown Pier." He should like to say a few words on the subject, which, as he wad a resident outside Sandown, he hoped would be accepted in all sincerity. The pier so far had been built by a mere handful of men. Fewer men than were assembled in that room had found the capital necessary to build what was nothing less than an institution — the pier which they had seen so ably opened by Lady Oglander that day, and he trusted that all those present, who had not yet done so, had decided to become shareholders. The capital required was £6,000, in 1,200 shares of £5 each, to build a pier 650 feet long, with the object, not only of benefiting the residents, but of bringing an additional number of visitors to Sandown. Perceiving the advantages of such a pier a number of the gentlemen present had put their hands in their pockets, and more than half the capital required had already been subscribed. He thought they ought not to be backward now, for he believed greater profit would accrue now than at the commencement. The pier as at present finished was 350 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it possessed one advantage which they did not often see. He had been on a great many piers, and he found seats generally rather scarce, but on the Sandown pier he noticed that seats ran from end to end, and there was plenty of room for those who could not walk about. He thought that arrangement would greatly contribute to the success of the undertaking. All that was wanted now was the means tor providing the remainder of the money required, ami for an outlay of another £2,500 or so they would be able to complete the pier to the length he had mentioned, so that they would always have nine or ten teet of water at the end of the pier, sufficient for steamers to come alongside at all times and take up or put down excursionists. Although they had a railway to Sandown they wanted something more— accommodation by water, and he hoped to find no difficulty in doing that. He believed it was a fact that all the preliminary expenses of this company—-getting the Bill in Parliament,&c.— in fact, all their Parliamentary expenses, were covered by a cheque for £200. That was sufficient to show that there was no promotion money paid, and he thought such a company, with responsible directors and not overweighted, must be a success. The directors, in addition to the large amount of shares they had taken, rather than open tho pier with any liability upon it, had given their names and taken a personal liability for £200 each beyond their holding. That showed the sort of opinion the directors had of the undertaking. In proposing the toast he hoped that every Sandown man would take a share. — The toast was received with three times three.

The Chairman said they were going to carry on the undertaking in an honest, straightforward way and if they only revived support They would make the pier oue of the best litile properties in the Isle of Wight. He had spent a great deal of time and money on the Newport Junction Railway, and if that had only been carried out as he said it ought to have been it would now be paying cent. per cent. A very small sum, only £2,000 more, was required to have the pier 650 ft. long, and not a penny of the money subscribed should be spent except on the pier (cheers).

The Mayor of Newport briefly responded to the toast of his health, and expressed the interest which was taken by the inhabitants of the capital of the Island in the progress and prosperity of Sandown. The easy distance of Sandown from Newport, and its many attractions would make it especially interesting to the inhabitants of the centre of the Island. With respect to the pier he considered it one of the most promising business investments in the Island.

The toast of "The Chairman and Directors", coupled with the name of Mr Binns, followed.

Mr. Binns said it was now some years since he attended the first meeting of the promoters of a scheme for the erection of a pier in their beautiful bay, and being of opinion that something of the sort would be a great acquisition to Sandown he most willingly advocated and supported the movement. A committee was formed and very quietly worked its way, and some three or four years after the plans of the proposed pier— a wooden structure with girders 7ft. deep and 40ft. span, supported on two 12in. cast-iron columns — were sent to him, with the request that he would undertake to superintend its creation, which he declined on the grounds that such a structure was not only out of date, but inelegant. He therefore suggested and got out a design for the structure, which they had this day had the pleasure of opening. The pier, so far as it extends, consists of seven bays of 50ft, span ; in each bay they are three girders 48ft. 9in. in the clear, and 3ft. deep, supported by three cast-iron columns firmly embedded in the gault or "blue slipper," than which nothing could make a firmer foundation. The principal novelty in the structure consists in the dolphin brackets and seat standards. The former are firmly bolted to vertical channel irons forming part of the lattice girder, and on the top of each bracket is bolted an ornamented seat standard ; consequently the two rows of seats, which are continuous throughout the entire length of the pier, are quite independent of the deck planking, which can at any time be taken up for repair, turned over, or renewed without interfering or in any way disturbing the seats.

Col. Brandt proposed the toast, of " The Sandown Local Board," and took a general review of the duties connected with the office of a member of the Local Board, and the difficulties standing in the way of a conscientious discharge of those duties.

Mr. W. Mew, in replying to the toast, assured them that he fully intended, as long as he had the honour of holding his present position at the Board, to faithfully and conscientiously carry out the duties entrusted in his hands.

The toast of "The Visitors " was ably proposed by Mr. W. H. Wooldridge, and responded to by Mr. Linfield, of Ventnor.

Mr. Pittis proposed in deservedly eulogistic terms. "The health of the secretary of the Pier Company," Mr. W. H. Wooldridge.

Mr. Wooldridge, in acknowledging the warm manner in which the toast had been received, very grotesquely described the difficulties of the day, and trusted he had been successful in surmounting those and other general difficulties connected with his office as well as it could reasonably be expected a man could do.

The toasts of "The Ladies" and "The Press" brought the proceedings to a close.

The Eurydice.

Mr. Jabiz Hughes has obtained some really remarkable views of the wrecked Eurydice as she lies of St. Helen's. The great defect in all the photos hitherto obtained is that they are taken from so great a distance that the wrecked ship bears but an insignificant part in the general view. Mr. Hughes appears to have taken his picture instantaneously from some boat close to the wreck, the position of the ship being accurately shown, as well as the men on her deck searching for the bodies, &c. The photographs are printed by the permanent process.

PORTSMOUTH, WEDNESDAY. SEPTEMBER 4.

We shall soon have heard the last of the ill-fated Eurydice. The finding of the Court-martial was generally anticipated by the public, and it is understood that the bringing of the vessel into harbour will be quickly followed by her breaking up. The catastrophe of the 24th of March last was one of the darkest in the annals of the British Navy, and yet it is apparently destined to leave only the shadow of a sad memory behind. It has been said that the first impulse of our countrymen after any great disaster is to " hang somebody." This temper has been a good deal satirised, and yet it has to a large extent a strictly logical foundation. The scientific mind is slow to ascribe anything to pure accident. A catastrophe may have been unforeseen, but it is generally discovered on investigation that its cause is perfectly intelligible, and such as extreme vigilance might have detected, and consequently avoided. When the sad intelligence of the foundering of the Eurydice was first made known, we expressed the opinion that fearful as were all the circumstances surrounding the loss of the vessel, it would be still more terrible were the conclusion to be reached, after mature deliberation, that the cause of the disaster was a complete mystery. The verdict of the first Coroner's Jury, which exonerated everybody from blame, was clearly not entitled to serious attention. No scientific or technical evidence was taken, and a single sitting sufficed for the inquiry. This cannot be said of the recent Court-martial, which, arriving at the same conclusion, has spent a working week in its attempt to elucidate the mystery. The finding of the Court may be divided into two parts-first, that which relates to the stability of the ship ; and secondly, that which concerns her handling at the time she went down. On the first point there appears to be no ground for any difference of opinion. Admitting the incompetence of all but experts to deal with the technicalities of the subject, it cannot be said to require any special knowledge to judge of the value of the evidence bearing upon this branch of the inquiry which was laid before the Court-martial. The Eurydice had always the reputation of being a good sailor, and it must now be regarded as beyond dispute that her conversion from a frigate into a training-ship in no degree diminished her stability. It is true the question of her stability was not specially considered when the plans for her conversion were originally under discussion, but this was only because the proposed changes were obviously such as to require no examination on this point. Since his attention has been particularly directed to this subject, Mr. Barnaby has come to the conclusion that the Euryjdice rather gained than lost in stability by her conversion, and Mr. W. B. Robinson is of the same opinion. Whatever, then, was the cause of the catastrophe it cannot be attributed to any positive or even comparative defects in the ship herself.

This should lead us to examine the other branch of the subject all the more closely. If the Eurydice foundered from no inherent fault of her own, was there anything in her handling on the fatal Sunday afternoon which caused the terrible result? The Court-martial declares that there was not, and yet the very language of the finding raises doubts which cannot, and honestly speaking, ought not to be suppressed. The immediate cause of the catastrophe was, of course, the sudden storm which for a few minutes raged with cyclonic fury, but as other vessels rode it out in safety some further explanation is obviously required. This is, in effect, acknowledged by the Court, which proceeds to say that " some of the upper ports on the main deck were open at the time, which materially conduced to the catastrophe," though the important addition is made that this step " was justifiable and usual under the state of the wind and weather up to the time of the actual occurrence of the storm." Here we reach the very root of the whole inquiry. Did the state of the weather really permit of such confidence as was displayed on board the Eurydice? The barometer had been falling for a couple of days or more, while the indications of a coming storm, though it may be " partially hidden," as the verdict recites, " by the proximity of the ship to high land," was so far apparent that the order to shorten sail had already been given and was actually in process of being obeyed. Is it wrong or uncharitable, under these circumstances, to surmise that the course pursued amounted to an error of judgment? It was impossible to anticipate the altogether exceptional fury of the gale, but would not the exercise of a little caution have made all the difference between entire safety and utter destruction? "It must be understood," observes the Times, in dealing with this part of the case, " that in the naval service a creeping servitude to caution would be intolerable." This principle is no doubt admirable in the exigencies of actual warfare, but it cannot be said to have any application to a vessel when simply making for port and within sight of "home." To suppose otherwise would be to infer that the commander of the Eurydice and his gallant companions knew the risk they were running, and were determined to brave it at all hazards. Fortunately no such foolhardy intention can be attributed to them. That each man did his duty according to his lights will be admitted by the most exacting of critics. What is not so certain is that the soundness of judgment exhibited on this occasion was of apiece with that courage and indomitable resolution which the British sailor evinces in every emergency.

The Diving at the Wreck of the Eurydice.

With reference to the amount paid to the divers in connection with the raising of the Eurydice, Messrs. Siebe and Gorman, submarine engineers to the Royal Navy, write that they had four men engaged at the wreck, and not three, as stated, and that it was only their foreman diver who received £1 5s. per tide. During the four months that operations were carried on the men were working day and night, and the pay they received was in the aggregate the same as that of the dockyard divers.

H.M.S. Atalanta.

Two hundred pinds offered by the Admiralty as a reward for any one giving definite information as to the cause or the locality of the loss of the missing training ship will be regarded by the relatives and friends of the poor fellows on hoard as an indication that there is no longer room for the slightest doubt as to the dreadful nature of the catastrophe. Even the official mind, which is slow to admit the occurrence of events prejudicial to itself, by the issue of this notice reluctantly places upon record the fact that the last gleam of hope for the safety of the ship and her precious cargo of human lives has vanished. It is now a melancholy certainty that the ship which was sent to sea by the Admiralty in the place of the Eurydice has met with a precisely similar fate — that she has been blown over and swalowed up by the pitiless waves, and that at one fell swoop has the desolation of death been carried to over three hundred homes. The country from end to end is thrilled with horror by this terrible calamity, and already the demand has gone forth that the Admiralty itself shall be placed upon its trial in order to the prevention of the recurrence of such woful mishaps. Although the reward of £250 has been offered, we much doubt whether we shall ever obtain reliable information as to the exact spot, or the time, or the method of the foundering. There is no doubt but that she went down carrying with her every trace of the accident, and whatever wreckage may be thrown up hereafter will have travelled so far in deep sea currents as to be valueless save as mementoes of the dead, The disaster is so awfully dreadful that it is impossible as yet to think or to write of it with calmness.

THE ATALANTA.

*The Brighton Gazette* of Thursday is responsible for a somewhat extraordinary statement concerning the missing training-ship Atalanta. It says : "We have special information from an authentic source that so long ago as the 4th of May a sailor of the mercantile marine, whose name is known, and who has been sometime in Newhaven and Brighton, communicated direct to the Admiralty full particulars, or at least the means of obtaining full particulars, and giving the reason why he was unable or afraid to come forward in the matter himself. This communication seems to have been ignored, and on the 12th or 13th he wrote again, saying he knew what certain parties were making out of the retention of the facts, and that he thought it wrong they should be longer withheld. This was again ignored, but the next day or so the Admiralty sent a letter for insertion in the daily papers, saying that they thought all hope of the Atalanta must now be abandoned!" The journal suggests that the offer of a reward was probably made with the view of inducing the man to come forward, but the same influence which prevented his coming forward in the first instance will probably have the same effect now. The *Gazette* concludes with a significant remark. It says : "When we add the fact, which is beyond all doubt — that during the present week certain not obscure persons, both in Brighton and London, have had in their hands a chart 'lined ' and marked with minute details of the Atalanta, at a date since any official or other information can be obtained of her, or is ever likely to be, we think we are justified in saying a very great mystery surrounds the whole matter, and that our information is special and extraordinary."

Mr. Edward H. Capper, of Cardiff, in discussing the loss of the Atalanta, calls attention to the suggestion frequently made that she may have capsized like the Eurydice. He points out that the Eurydice did not capsize, but foundered because when lying over heavily under a press of canvas she filled through her lee ports, which were open. He adds that he was never in any ship which would not have done the same.

The Secretary of the Royal Naval School, New Cross, writes : " I have the pleasure to acquaint you that at a meeting of the Council of the Royal Naval School, held at New Cross, on Tuesday, I was directed at once to ascertain the number of children of officers of ward-room rank left fatherless by this sad calamity, with a view to receiving their sons into this school on such terms as the circumstances in each case may render necessary."

In the history of lost vessels probably the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty never took so much trouble to obtain intelligence as in the case of the missing Atalanta. In prosecuting enquiries, letters have been addressed to the following maritime nations, requesting that captains of vessels should be instructed to keep a look-out for ahy trace of the missing ship: France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austro-Hungary, Greece, Chili, and the United States of America. The foregoing Powers are those who have recently combined with England in a new and important system of international ocean signalling. The ready acquiescence manifested by all the maritime governments of the earth makes it evident that there is a world-wide sympathy with England, and an anxiety to aid in ascertaining the fate of those 300 youths whose disappearance is at present involved in mystery. At tbe present time there must be some thousands of vessels on the watch.

THE ATALANTA DISASTER.—

The Plover, gun boat, Commander Steward, as to whose safety there were serious misgivings until intimation of her arrival at Vigo was received, reached Spithead on Wednesday morning with five ordinary seaman who belonged to the Atalanta, but who, happily for themselves, did not take passage in her when she left Bermuda. These and an ordinary seaman named Varling are all who remain of the crew, and they will, it is understood, be examined by the Court appointed to investigate the circumstances connected with the disappearance of the vessel. The men give the Atalanta a very bad character.
