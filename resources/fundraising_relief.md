# Fundraising and Relief

Almost immediately following reports of the tragedy, fundraising relief activities sprang into action to raise funds to support the "wives, orphans and relatives" of the lost seamen. The committee so convened had in part been involved with another relief effort from another fatal incident at Portsmouth Harbour several years earlier.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

A meeting of naval officers and influential inhabitants of Portsmouth was held on Wednesday at the College in the Dockyard for the purpose of organizing a Eurydice Relief Committee. The sad occasion drew together a number of gentlemen who were formerly associated for the relief of the sufferers by the Thunderer explosion and whose offer of services for a similar purpose were heartily welcomed. Among the gentlemen present were Admiral Fanshawe, Rear-Admiral Foley, Admiral Raby, Captains Wilson, Herbert, Singer, Arthur, Kelly, Peile, and Henderson, the Mayor and ex-Mayor of Portsmouth,the Vicar of Portsmouth, Colonel Burnaby,Colonel Richards, Inspector-General Domville, Canon Doyle, Commanders Otley, Wilson, and Swinson, and Mr. Griffin, J.P. The chair was taken by Admiral Fanshawe, Commander-in-Chief.

The Chairman said he did not think it necessary to make many remarks in introducing the business of the meeeting, as absolutely all that was known with respect to the calamity which had befallen the *Eurydice* had been published in the pablic prints. They had met to give practical effect to the sympathy they felt for the famiies and relatives of the sufferers in their great distress.

Captain WILSON said that on Monday evening himself and a few other officers met together and formed a provisional committee. The names of these gentlemen were telegraphed up to Lord Charles Beresford, the commander of the Thunder, and were published in the *Mail*. By means of this provisional committee they were enabled to give the matter a start. The names of the committee were the Commander-in-Chief, Admral Foley, Captain Herbert, Captain Jones, Mr. Wise, Mr. Richards and himself. Invitations were then issued to all the ships and clubs, and one was sent to the Generals commanding, and notices were given in all the newspapers. The objects of the meeting were to take into connsideration the best mode of raising a relief fund, and, moreover to relieve the provisional committee of any further responsibility. The cashier and seeretary who had manage the affairs of the Thunderer's fund so ably came forward and aided the committee in this preliminary work, and Mr. Richards was now acting as hon. treaseurer and Mr. Wise as hon. secretary. As the latter would have to work morning and night to carry on the business, they could not expect him to perform his duties quite gratuitously. After describing the progress of the business, Captain Wilson said the provisional committee had received subscriptions which had been placeg in the hands of the treasurer to the amount of—speaking roughly—about £270, which included a donation from the Commander-in-Chief of £25. They had been promised altogether about £390 more, which included £50 from the First Lord of Admiralty, £25 from Sir Massey Lopes, and £25 from Hon. Mr. Egerton. In addition to this they had already received about £11O from subscriptions on board the Thunderer, and from other ships £200 had been received, the *Excellent* giving the sum of £155. Thus there had been raised the large sum of £850 which, considering that hardly 72 hours had elapsed since the unfortunate catastophe had occurred, must be regarded as very handsome and satisfactory, and very much larger than had been raised when the meeting assembled there some ten days after the accident on board the Thunderer occurred. The services of Mr. Wise and of Mr. Richards had been secured, and the committee had the advantage of their great knowledge in the management of these matters. In the case of the Thunderer they were not able to strike the iron while it was hot, and in consequence a great deal of money that might have been obtained was lost. But now the gentlemen mentioned had taken this thing in hand, they knew how to pull all the wires; and, no doubt, if the meeting gave them authority they would within 48 hours have circulars and appeals all over England, and all the machinery at work for obtaining a satisfactory result. As far was at present known, there were but three officers and 28 men of the Eurydice who had wives and families, and there were 69 men who were the support of relatives, mothers or sisters. But, of course, that could not represent all the married petty officers and men. It was quite probable that a large number of them did not "allot" to their wives, and hence the committee had not yet received information as to all the cases. There were a captain of the Royal Engineers and six sappers and miners, and as these were all time expired, they were probably married. There was also a sergeant of Marines and 12 men from Bermuda, a large number of whom married. That was all he could tell the meeting.

The first resolution, which was moved by the CHAIRMAN and seconded by Captain Arthur was as follows:—

"The appalling accident to Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, whereby numerous families are rendered comparatively destitute through loss of the bread-winner, calls for the sympathy of all who hold that England should ever maintain her supremacy on the ocean, and this meeting pledges itself to use every endeavour to alleviate, as far as possible, the grievous loss sustained by the widows, orphans and relatives of those who, within sight of their homes, perished in the execution of their duty to their country."

Admiral Foley moved and Mr. James Griffin seconded:—

"That a certain number of gentlemen be elected to form a standing committee with power to add to their number, and to select a sub or managing committee."

This having been carried, a powerful committee was formed consisting of the Admirals, Caaptain Wilson, the Mayor, and the principal gentelment present, together with Lord Charles Beresford, Mr. Sebastian Gassiot and others who were not abale to attend.

On the motion of Captain Kelly, seconded by Staff Commander Braddon, Mr. Richards, of the Dockyard, and Mr. Wise, both of whom belonged to the Thunderer Relief Fund Committee, were appointed treasurer and secretary, and the National and Provincial Bank, Portsea, was selected as the banker of the fund.

Mr. Pink, the ex-Mayor of Portsmouth, moved that a deputation wait upn the Lord Mayor of London and the City Companies to ask their assistance and co-operation. The resolution was seconded by the Vicar of Portsmouth, who, as a civilian, was anxious to state that the loss of the Eurydice was felt as much by the general public as by the Navy itself.

Inspector-General Domville moved, and Mr, Penfold, R.N., seconded, that the clergy and ministers of all denominations and the various clubs be appealed to for subscriptions; it was also agreed, on the motion of Commander Otely, seconded by Lieutenant Ackland, that circular letters be sent to all Her Majesty's ships, marine divisions, regiment dockyards, and naval hospitals.

A vote of thanks having been accorded to Admiral Fanshawe for presiding, on the motion of the Mayorof Portsmouth and Liietenant-Colonel Galt, the proceedings terminated. In addition to the sums mentioned by Captain Wilson, over £30 was subscribed in the room, and in proof of the interest which is taken in the charitable movement by the seamen of the port, it may be stated that the sum contributed by the crew of the Thunderer amounts to an average of 4s. per man. A meeting of the general committee is appointed to meet at this dockyard this afternoon.

...

The Lord Mayor has intimated to the naval authorities at Portsmouth his willingness to receive subscriptions at the Mission House in aid of the fund now being raised for the relief of the widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of the men lost.

Of that were 177l. 16s. 1d. was the result of a spontaneous collection made on the previous day by the Rev. Canon Fleming, at St. Michael's, Chester-square. Messrs. Roberts, Lubbock and Co., contributed 25l.; Messrs. Coutts and Co. 25l.; Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smiths, 251.; Mr. Ernest Hankey, 25l. ; some clerks in the London Joint-Stock Bank, 6l. 11s. 6d.; and at Messrs. Prescott's, 5l. 5s.; and Mr. Lewis Lloyd, 20l. The sum of 23l. 19s. 10d. was dropped into the box outside the Mansion House by passers-by during the day. Including the sum collected on the Stock Exchange, the Mansion House Fund now amounts to about 1000l.

[Correspondence from Ventnor]

Writing from Ventnor our correspondent says that the subscriptions to the Eurydice Relief Fund are flowing in rapidly, and a handsome sum will be sent to the Portsmouth Committee. The large amount of 70l. was collected in a few hours by the Chief Officer of the Coastguard in the little village of St. Lawrence, and a very influential committee has been appointed. Mr. J. G. Livesay (honorary secretary) is, working very earnestly in the matter, and his efforts are rewarded with success, the list being headed by two subscriptions of 20 guineas each from Miss Bligh, of Torwood, and J. Snowden-Henry, Esq., respectively. On Sunday special collections were made in the various places of worship in the town in aid of the Fund, which were all crowded by attentive congregations. The sermons generally contained some special reference to the recent catastrophe, and very earnest and eloquent appeals were made for the widows and relatives of the crew. Especially was this the case at the Congregational Church, which was crowded both morning and evening, the Rev. Mr. Davies, the pastor, being the minister who the visited the survivors, Cuddiford and Fletcher, after the capsizing of the frigate. On Sunday a large number of persons visited the neighbourhood of the wreck from all parts of the Island. Two boys on Sunday afternoon picked up a sailor's straw hat bearing the Eurydice's name on the ribbon, and marked inside "G. Field," and this seems to be the only thing which has been picked up on the shore since the disaster, belonging to the vessel. The name of Field, however, does not appear, we believe, in the published list of the crew.

Mr. J. G. Livesay, the Hon. Secretary to the Ventnor Committee, writes to the *Times*:-Will you allow me to make a proposal through the ubiquitous columns of the Times, which, if adopted, will bring a large accession to the fund now being raised for the widows, orphans, and other dependent relatives of the brave men whom the nation has so grievously lost? It is that a simultaneous collection be made on Saturday next by employers throughout the country in their offices, shops, factories, farmyards, workshops, etc. The builders in this town have promised me that they will make such an appeal to their hands, and I am sure that it will meet with a hearty response. I believe there are few working men in the British Isles who would not on such an occasion cheerfully give a quarter or half of a day's pay, according as the circumstances of their own families might permit. The head of every household should ask each of his servants for a trifle, and even our children may give their penny and upwards. A very erroneous impression is abroad, even here on the scene of the catastrophe, as to the probable number of persons who will require relief. Because the Eurydice was a training ship it has been assumed that nearly all her crew would be very young and unmarried. But she was a training ship for ordinary seamen, not boys, and I have just been informed on good authority that a much larger proportion of the crew were married than had been supposed. Let no one be afraid of giving too much. Even if there should be a surplus after providing for the present sufferers, it might form a valuable reserve fund for similar cases in the future, just as the large surplus of the Hartley Colliery Explosion Fund has proved so useful for other contingencies of its kind.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

The Lord Mayor of London has received the following telegram from Captain Wilson (H.M.S. Thunderer), Portsea:— "Your telegram has been laid before the general committee of this (Eurydice) fund, and I desired to convey to your lordship the expression of their deep sense of your lordship's consideration in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Eurydice, and gratefully accept your offer." Accordingly the Lord Mayor will receive subscriptions at the Mansion House. It is not intended to appoint a committee, his lordship promising to forward all the subscriptions which may entrusted to him to the Portsmouth Committee. The box which was placed outside the Mansion House during the Indian Famine Fund, and proved such a prolific source of income to that fund, is again placed in the same position for the Eurydice relief.

THE LOSS OF THE "EURYDICE."

...

On Friday the Lord Mayor received from Captain J. C. Wilson, A.D.C. of the Thunderer, a communication conveying to him, on behalf of the Portsmouth Committee, an expression of their deep sense of his kindness in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Eurydice, and gratefully accepting his offer. In the afternoon, also, Lord Charles Beresford, M.P , waited upon the Lord Mayor, and personally tendered him the thanks of the naval authorities at Portsmouth for the promptness of his assistance, which was much appreciated. The following appeal has been issued from the Mansion House on the subject: " The Lord Mayor, at the desire of the naval authorities at Portsmouth, will most gladly receive at the Mansion House donations for the support of the widows, orphans, dependents, and relatives of the crew of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, which sank off the Isle of Wight with nearly all hands on Sunday last. The loss of a gallant crew of over 300 young British sailors, within sight of home and in such distressing and appalling circumstances, has created a deep feeling of sorrow throughout the country. It has been thought that the sympathy of the public in this disaster cannot be better or more practically shown than by affording aid to those bereaved relatives whose only means of support has been cut off so suddenly and sadly. The Portsmouth Committee are obtaining details of the number of widows, children, aged parents, and others rendered destitute by the calamity. The Lord Mayor meanwhile appeals to his fellow citizens and the public at large for donations for the relief of these sufferers, and he hopes that the response may be such as to enable him to remit a very handsome sum to the local committee at Portsmouth, with whom he is in direct communication."

THE FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE."

A meeting of the Portsmouth General Committee of the Eurydice Relief Fund was held at the College on Monday afternoon. The Commander-in-Chief (Admiral Fanshawe, C.B.) who presided, moved, the ex-Mayor (Mr W. Pink) seconded, and it was resolved : "That this committee, while recognising the expediency of collecting funds for those rendered destitute by the foundering of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice through several agencies as likely to enrol the largest number of subscribers, are of one opinion, that it is desirable, with a view to the efficient administration of the funds collected, that the whole should be distributed through one agency ; and that the machinery of the Patriotic Fund, so enlarged in 1875, for such objects by a Royal Commission, offer the best means for the purpose. That this committee accordingly intends to apply to the Royal Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund to receive the sums collected to be administered by the Royal Commissioners, uuder the schema adopted for the Captain Fund, excepting such sum, as they might find absolutely necessary to give for urgent and immediate relief." It was further determined : "That the Secretary be deputed to place himself in communication with the London Eurydice Relief Committee presided over by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, with a view to the joint intentions of the two committees being carried out."

[The extent of relief required...]

...

Lord Henry Lennox writes to say, regarding the Eurydice fund, that, as far as is at present known, there are between 40 and 50 widows, 170 parents, and from 60 to 70 other relatives who were partly, and in many cases mainly, dependent upon those who have perished, and have therefore claims on the fund. It is calculated that £20,000 will be required in order to administer a minimum relief to all the sufferers. Of this sum about one half has been collected by the committee presided over by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, by the Lord Mayor's committee, and by Admiral Fanshawe's committee at Portsmouth. In order to obtain the amount still necessary, Lord Henry makes a further earnest appeal to the public. The Commissioners of the Royal Patriotic Fund have undertaken the distribution of the money, in accordance with chthea powers conferred upon them by a Royal Commission in 1875.

Sir.— I think it would have been but bare justice to Mr. Wiltshire, who was deputed to collect money for the Eurydice Fund, had his name appeared, as having been selected for that office, in the paragraph heading the list of subscriptions published in your last issue. It appears to me that this was the least recognition that could be made of his untiring exertions in this charitable work ; a recognition which the public would certainly not have grudged him. Trusting to your courtesy to allow these few lines to appear in your widely circulated journal, and enclosing my card,

I am, Sir, yours faithfully,

Ventnor. Concert at Ventnor in aid of the Eurydice Distress Fund.

A very excellent entertainment was given last Friday afternoon in the fine coffee room of the Royal Hotel, kindly lent by Mr. Mason, in aid of the Eurydice Distress Fund. We regret to have to say that the attendance was somewhat limited. The names of those who with the greatest good nature came from Ryde and who did so much to make the concert a success, should have provoked a hearty reception from the dwellers in Ventnor. The programme appended will indicate the character of the entertainment ; and as to the several performers, we do not know that we can say more than that each achieved a perfect success. Miss Wallace, daughter of Col. Wallace, of Ryde, who won the unqualified praise of musical critics by her singing at a concert in the Albert Hall, sang as well as we remember to have heard her, and despite the rule to the contrary, was obliged to submit to an encore. Miss Jessie Browne was suffering from a slight cold, yet fully sustained her reputation, and won rounds of applause. Miss Abbott, who is the daughter of a gentleman visiting Ventnor, is a performer of great finish, and was vehemently encored. Master Denton sang very sweetly and added very greatly to the pleasure of the afternoon, winning loud applause and a decided encore when he sang "The little tin soldier." Mr. Perkins, also a visitor, is a thorough musician, and a violinist of the highest order. Thanks cannot be too heartily given given to Miss M. Fowles, who most efficiently discharged the part of accompanist throughout. We should not omit to mention that Mr. Bourne, Manager of the Isle of Wight Railway, readily sent passes for those ladies and gentleman of Ryde who so kindly gave their help. The programme was as foliows : Pianoforte Solo, Ballade (Opus 23rd), Miss H. D. Abbot. Song, "Che faro senza Eurydice," Miss Wallace. Song, "The Token," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Violin Solo, D. Perkin, Esq. song " Non é Ver," Miss Jessie Browne. Song, "O fond dove, O fair dove," Master Willie Denton. Pianoforte Solo, " Introduzione and Rondo " from Sonata (Opus 53) Miss H. D. Abbott.

The Eurydice Fund.

The executive committee of the Eurydice Relief Fund have reported that they have received from Mr. Finlaison, the actuary to the National Debt Office, an estimate of the amount necessary to provide the annuities for the widows and children of the officers and men lost in the Eurydice and having investigated the claims proffered by the other relatives of the officers and men, they now place before the general committee a scheme for the distribution of the fund. The amount received by the treasurer is £12,792 ; expended in immediate relief, £126; advertising £794; office expenses, £14B—total, £558; leaving an available balance of £12,223. Collected by the Lord Mayor, £5,496 ; ditto London Committee, £4 436—total, £22,156. There are two commissioned officers' widows, one commissioned officer's sister, and three warrant officers' widows. It is proposed to appropriate for the widows a capital sum sufficient to provide annuities according to the rank of their late husbands, as by the scale devised by the Patriotic Fund, and the sister of the commissioned officer's to receive half the allowance granted to a widow ; this will require £2,790. Children of commissioned officers, three ; warrant officers, five, In like manner it is proposed to appropriate a sum of money, estimated by Mr. Finlaison as sufficient to provide allowances for these children—namely, £78O Thus, for widows, orphans, and other relatives of the officers it is proposed to allocate £3570. There are thirty-four widows of seamen and Marines and forty eight children ; three widows of Royal Engineers and four children. Of these one widow, being in a lunatic asylum, will not come upon the fund, and another has, on account of improper conduct, been struck off the list. Three of the children have been provided for in homes; three other of the above children will have to be granted allowances of larger amounts as having lost both parents. Thus there are in all thiriy-five widows and forty-nine children provide for, for whom Mr. Finlaison estimates that it will be necessary to set aside £10, 400. The other relatives to be assisted are mothers and fathers, forty-two ; other relatives, thirteen ; total, 167. Each case having been carefully considered, it is submitted that sums equal in amount to annuities at the rate of 5s. per week, varying in duration from one to four years, should be paid in respect to these relatives. In dealing with those in receipt of the grant from the Admiralty (equal to a year’s pay of the lost relative) the sum thus granted has been deducted from the amount which it has been considered should be paid to the relatives from this fund ; thus mothers of seamen, whose annuity wou'd be 5s. week, or £13 a year, equal for four years to £52, having received £22 from the Admiralty will be paid the difference between the two sums —viz., £30 —by payments at the rate of 5s. a week. In the case of the captain the grants were paid over to the fund, and the arrangements were made for the distribution of these and the grants from the fund as whole. In the present case the Admiralty have paid the sums direct to the relatives. It appears therefore to the executive committee that the weekly allowance of 5s. should commerce on the 1st April, 1879, in the case of those to whom grants from the Admiralty have been made, and on the 1st October, 1878, in cases where no such grants have been made. For the mothers £2387 will be required ; for fathers, £585; other relatives, £19O ; total, £3162. There remains to he added the capital sum required to pay the charges of the Patriotic Fund for distributing the several annuities during the whole time of their respective duration. This, calculated at the rate shown in the report of the commissioners as paid in regard to the Captain's Fund for the year 1876, is £1257, being 7 1-3 per cent, on the total amount of the capital sums representing such annuities. It follows therefore that if this scheme be approved the following amount will be required: —Commissioned officers' widows, £1660 ; warrant officers widows, £1140; commissioned officers' children, £320; warrant officers' children, £460 ; widows and children of seamen and Marines and men of Royal Engineers, £10,400 ; other relatives of men, £3162 ; total £17,132 ; to meet expenses attendant upon distribution (7 1-3 per cent, on £17,132), £1257; to meet unforeseen requirements of the fund, £611 ; total, £19 OOO. The latter sum being the approximate amount required to meet the wants for which the fund was started, the executive committee submit that any balance remaining at the final closing of the fund should be handed over to the Royal Patriotic Commissioners for distriburion under the conditions of the Royal Naval Relief Fund for the widows and orphans of men who have lost their lives through accidents when belonging to H.M.'s ships, the committee believing that the generous donors to the fund, whilst desiring that the sufferers through the loss of the Eurydice should be fairly and libetally relieved, would feel equally desirous that the widow and orphan of the man who, falling from aloft any other accident, may lose his life on duty should far as possible be alleviated in their distress. It was with this object that the Queen issued the commission in 1875 which established the Royal Naval Relief Fund, and to this fund should be added any balance which may be left at the termination of the trust. A meeting was held on October 21 at Portsmouth Dockyard of the central committee of the fund, with Admiral Fanshawe in the chair. The executive committee having handed in the foregoing report and balance of distribution, the report was adopted, and officers were appointed to superintend the transfer of the fund.

The Executive Committee of the Eurydice Relief Fund has prepared, for presentation to the General Committee, a scheme, based upon a report of Mr. Finlaison, the actuary, for the distribution of the fund among the widows, children, and other relatives of the officers and seamen lost in that ill fated vessel. The fund somewhat exceeds twenty-two thousand pounds; and the scheme, and the expenses of carrying it out, will absorb all but three thousand. It is proposed that any balance remaining should be handed to the Royal Naval Relief Fund.

"EURYDICE" FUND.

At the meeting of the general committee of the Eurydice Relief Fund, held in the Dockyard last week, the 4th of November was fixed as the date of the final meeting. The following announcement has, however, been made since by Mr. F. Penfold, the honorary secretary :—In consequence of the absence of the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War from England, it is not possible to complete the deed of transfer of the funds to the Royal Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund. It will, therefore, be necessary to postpone the final committee meeting ordered for the 4th proximo to a date shortly after the return of the two trustees, of which due notice will be given. I may, however, say that arrangements have been made for the the payments ordered to be made from the 1st October to be carried out, and sufficient funds have been placed to the credit of the Patriotic Fuund.

FINAL MEETING OF THE EURYDICE COMMITTEE.

The final meeting of the Eurydice Relief Committee was held yesterday afternoon at the College in the Dockyard, Admiral E. G. Fanshawe, C.B., Naval Commander-in-Chief and President of the Committee, in the chair. There was a good attendance of members. The following report was presented by the Executive Commttee, and was unanimously adopted:—

The Executive Committee present the final report of their proceedings, which have extended over eight months. In doing so they have acknowledge the very liberal subscriptions from the public generally, amounting to £23,040 2s 6d. Of this sum it is most gratifying abke to state that £4,208 15s. 2d. has been subscribed by the officers and men of the fleet. At a general meeting, held on 10th April, 1878, it was "resolved that the monies collected for the relief of the widows, orphans, and relatives of the officars, seamen, and marines left destitute by the loss of H.M.S. Eurydice should be transferred to the Royal Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund, for distribution, and this was confirmed subsequent meeting held on 24th August, 1878. In accordance with this resolution a deed of transfer has been drawn up, specifying the amount voted to the different classes of recipients, the mode of distribution, and the arrangement for the disposal of the balance. The transfer has been completed, and the deed signed by the Official Trustees. The following are the sources of the amount subscribed : Lord Mayor's Fund, £5,490 16s. 7d. ; London Committee (Lord Henry Lennox, secretary), £4,436 8s. 1d. ; Portsmouth Committee, £12,964 17s. 7d. interest, £142 3s. 3d. ; total £23,040 2s. 6d., which has baen dealt with as shewn in the accompanying balance sheet.

The sad calamity left to be provided for :—Two widows of commissioned officers, one sister of commissioned officer, three widows of warrant officers, three children of commissioned officers, five children of warrant officers, 34 widows of seamen and marines, three widows of Royal Engineers, 48 children of seamen and marines, four children of Royal Engineers, 112 mothers of seamen, and marines, 42 fathers seamen and marines, 13 other relatives. To pay the annuities the sum of £19,000 has been appropriated and transferred to the Commissioners of the Royal Patriotic Fund. The subscriptions having exceeded the requirements for which this fund was opened, the surplus (after paying the amounts required for immediate relief and necessary expenses) wiil form a nucleus of "The Royal Naval Relief Fund," accordance with the resolution passed at the last general meeting, and the sum of £3,150 has been handed to the Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund for this purpose, the balance that may remain after paying and advertising the final proceedings of the Committee will be handed to the Commissioners for the same object. It is, however, right to add that the Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund have power under the deed of transfer, in case the sum of £19,000 should hereafter be found insufficient to meet all the payments to the widows and orphans of the officers and men lost in the Eurydice, to take such amount as may be required from the sum of £3,150.

The Committee desire to report that the mode of disposal set forth in the deed of transfer, and that the rate of payments established is as follows :—
