THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

A meeting of naval officers and influential inhabitants of Portsmouth was held on Wednesday at the College in the Dockyard for the purpose of organizing a Eurydice Relief Committee. The sad occasion drew together a number of gentlemen who were formerly associated for the relief of the sufferers by the Thunderer explosion and whose offer of services for a similar purpose were heartily welcomed. Among the gentlemen present were Admiral Fanshawe, Rear-Admiral Foley, Admiral Raby, Captains Wilson, Herbert, Singer, Arthur, Kelly, Peile, and Henderson, the Mayor and ex-Mayor of Portsmouth,the Vicar of Portsmouth, Colonel Burnaby,Colonel Richards, Inspector-General Domville, Canon Doyle, Commanders Otley, Wilson, and Swinson, and Mr. Griffin, J.P. The chair was taken by Admiral Fanshawe, Commander-in-Chief.

The Chairman said he did not think it necessary to make many remarks in introducing the business of the meeeting, as absolutely all that was known with respect to the calamity which had befallen the *Eurydice* had been published in the pablic prints. They had met to give practical effect to the sympathy they felt for the famiies and relatives of the sufferers in their great distress.

Captain WILSON said that on Monday evening himself and a few other officers met together and formed a provisional committee. The names of these gentlemen were telegraphed up to Lord Charles Beresford, the commander of the Thunder, and were published in the *Mail*. By means of this provisional committee they were enabled to give the matter a start. The names of the committee were the Commander-in-Chief, Admral Foley, Captain Herbert, Captain Jones, Mr. Wise, Mr. Richards and himself. Invitations were then issued to all the ships and clubs, and one was sent to the Generals commanding, and notices were given in all the newspapers. The objects of the meeting were to take into connsideration the best mode of raising a relief fund, and, moreover to relieve the provisional committee of any further responsibility. The cashier and seeretary who had manage the affairs of the Thunderer's fund so ably came forward and aided the cdturuittee in this preliminary work, and Mr. Richarda was now acting as hon. treaseurer and Mr. Wise as hon. secretary. As the latter would have to work morning and night to carry on the business, they could not expect him to perform his duties quite gratuitously. After describing the progress of the business, Captain Wilson said the provisional committee had received subscriptions which had been placeg in the hands of the treasurer to the amount of—speaking roughly—about £270, which included a donation from the Commander-in-Chief of £25. They had been promised altogether about £390 more, which included £50 from the First Lord of Admiralty, £25 from Sir Massey Lopes, and £25 from Hon. Mr. Egerton. In addition to this they had already received about £11O from subscriptions on board the Thunderer, and from other ships £200 had been received, the *Exellent* giving the sum of £155. Thus there had been raised the large sum of £850 which, considering that hardly 72 hours had elapsed since the unfortunate catastophe had occurred, must be regarded as very handsome and satisfactory, and very much larger than had been raised when the meeting assembled there some ten days after the accident on board the Thunderer occurred. The services of Mr. Wise and of Mr. Richards had been secured, and the committee had the advantage of their great knowledge in the management of these matters. In the case of the Thunderer they were not able to strike the iron while it was hot, and in consequence a great deal of money that might have been obtained was lost. But now the gentlemen mentioned had taken this thing in hand, they knew how to pull all the wires; and, no doubt, if the meeting gave them authority they would within 48 hours have circulars and appeals all over England, and all the machinery at work for obtaining a satisfactory result. As far was at present known, there were but three officers and 28 men of the Eurydice who had wives and families, and there were 69 men who were the support of relatives, mothers or sisters. But, of course, that could not represent all the married petty officers and men. It was quite probable that a large number of thrm did not "allot" to their wives, and hence the committee had not yet received information as to all the cases. There were a captain of the Royal Engineers and six sappers and miners, and as these were all time expired, they were probably married. There was also a sergeant of Marines and 12 men from Bermuda, a large number of whom married. That was all he could tell the meeting.

The first resolution, which was moved by the CHAIRMAN and seconded by Captain Arthur was as follows:—

"The appalling accident to Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, whereby numerous families are rendered comparatively destitute through loss of the bread-winner, calls for the sympathy of all who hold that England should ever maintain her supremacy on the ocean, and this meeting pledges itself to use every endeavour to alleviate, as far as possible, the grievous loss sustained by the widows, orphans and relatives of those who, within sight of their homes, perished in the execution of their duty to their country."

Admiral Foley moved and Mr. James Griffin seconded:—

"That a certain number of gentlemen be elected to form a standing committee with power to add to their number, and to select a sub or managing committee."

This having been carried, a powerful committee was formed consisting of the Admirals, Caaptain Wilson, the Mayor, and the principal gentelment present, together with Lord Charles Beresford, Mr. Sebastian Gassiot and others who were not abale to attend.

On the motion of Captain Kelly, seconded by Staff Commander Braddon, Mr. Richards, of the Dockyard, and Mr. Wise, both of whom belonged to the Thunderer Relief Fund Committee, were appointed treasurer and secretary, and the National and Provincial Bank, Portsea, was selected as the banker of the fund.

Mr. Pink, the ex-Mayor of Portsmouth, moved that a deputation wait upn the Lord Mayor of London and the City Companies to ask their assistance and co-operation. The resolution was seconded by the Vicar of Portsmouth, who, as a civilian, was anxious to state that the loss of the Eurydice was felt as much by the general public as by the Navy itself.

Inspector-General Domville moved, and Mr, Penfold, R.N., seconded, that the clergy and ministers of all denominations and the various clubs be appealed to for subscriptions; it was also agreed, on the motion of Commander Otely, seconded by Lieutenant Ackland, that circular letters be sent to all Her Majesty's ships, marine divisions, regiment dockyards, and naval hospitals.

A vote of thanks having been accorded to Admiral Fanshawe for presiding, on the motion of the Mayorof Portsmouth and Liietenant-Colonel Galt, the proceedings terminated. In addition to the sums mentioned by Captain Wilson, over £30 was subscribed in the room, and in proof of the interest which is taken in the charitable movement by the seamen of the port, it may be stated that the sum contributed by the crew of the Thunderer amounts to an average of 4s. per man. A meeting of the general committee is appointed to meet at this dockyard this afternoon.

...

The Lord Mayor has intimated to the naval authorities at Portsmouth his willingness to receive subscriptions at the Mission House in aid of the fund now being raised for the relief of the widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of the men lost.

THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

The Lord Mayor of London has received the following telegram from Captain Wilaon (H.M.S. Thunderer), Portsea:— "Your telegram has been laid before the general committee of this (Enrydice) fund, and I desired to convey to your lordship the expression of their deep sense of your lordship s consideration in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Enrydiee, and gratefully accept your offer." Accordingly the Lord Mayor will receive subscriptions at the Mansion House. It is not intended to appoint a committee, his lordship promising to forward all the subscriptions which may entrusted to him to the Portsmouth Committee. The box which was placed outside the Mansion House during the Indian Famine Fund, and proved such a prolific source of income to that fund, is again placed in the same position for the Eurydice relief.

THE LOSS OF THE "EURYDICE."

...

On Friday the Lord Mayor received from Captain J. C. Wilson, A.D.C. of the Thunderer, a communication conveying to him, on behalf of the Portsmouth Committee, an expression of their deep sense of his kindness in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Eurydice, and gratefully accepting his offer. In the afternoon, also, Lord Charles Beresford, M.P , waited upon the Lord Mayor, and personally tendered him the thanks of the naval authorities at Portsmouth for the promptness of his assistance, which was much appreciated. The following appeal has been issued from the Mansion House on the subject: " The Lord Mayor, at the desire of the naval authorities at Portsmouth, will most gladly receive at the Mansion House donations for the support of the widows, orphans, dependents, and relatives of the crew of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, which sank off the Isle of Wight with nearly all hands on Sunday last. The loss of a gallant crew of over 300 young British sailors, within sight of home and in such distressing and appalling circumstances, has created a deep feeling of sorrow throughout the country. It has been thought that the sympathy of the public in this disaster cannot be better or more practically shown than by affording aid to those bereaved relatives whose only means of support has been cut off so suddenly and sadly. Tne Portsmouth Committee are obtaining details of the number of widows, children, aged parents, and others rendered destitute by the calamity. The Lord Mayor meanwhile appeals to his fellow citizens and the public at large for donations for the relief of these sufferers, and he hopes that the response may be such as to enable him to remit a very handsome sum to the local committee at Portsmouth, with whom he is in direct communication."

Lord Henry Lennox writes to say, regarding the Eurydice fund, that, as far as is at present known, there are between 40 and 50 widows, 170 parents, and from 60 to 70 other relatives who were partly, and in many cases mainly, dependent upon those who have perished, and have therefore claims on the fund. It is calculated that £20,000 will be required in order to administer a minimum relief to all the sufferers. Of this sum about one half has been collected by the committee presided over by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, by the Lord Mayor's committee, and by Admiral Fanshawe's committee at Portsmouth. In order to obtain the amount still necessary, Lord Henry makes a further earnest appeal to the public. The Commissioners of the Royal Patriotic Fund have undertaken the distribution of the money, in accordance with chthea powers conferred upon them by a Royal Commission in 1875.

To the Editor of the hie of Wight Observer.

Sir.— I think it would have been but bare justice to Mr. Wiltshire, who was deputed to collect money for the Eurydice Fund, had his name appeared, as having been selected for that office, in the paragraph heading the list of subscriptions published in your last issue. It appears to me that this was the least recognition that could be made of his untiring exertions in this charitable work ; a recognition which the public would certainly not have grudged him. Trusting to your courtesy to allow these few lines to appear in your widely circulated journal, and enclosing my card,

I am, Sir, yours faithfully,  
FIAT JUSTITIA, RUAT COELUM.

Ventnor. Concert at Ventnor in aid of the Eurydice Distres Fund.

A very excellent entertainment was given last Friday afternoon in the fine coffee room of the Royal Hotel, kindly lent by Mr. Mason, in aid of the Eurydice Distress Fund. We regret to have to say that the attendance was somewhat limited. The names of those who with the greatest good nature came from Ryde and who did so much to make the concert a success, should have provoked a hearty reception from the dwellers in Ventnor. The programme appended will indicate the character of the entertainment ; and as to the several performers, we do not know that we can say more than that each achieved a perfect success. Miss Wallace, daughter of Col. Wallace, of Ryde, who won the unqualified praise of musical critics by her singing at a concert in the Albert Hall, sang as well as we remember to have heard her, and dispite the rule to the contrary, was obliged to submit to an encore. Miss Jessie Browne was suffering from a slight cold, yet fully sustained her reputation, and won rounds of applause. Miss Abbott, who is the daughter of a gentleman visiting Ventnor, is a performer of great finish, and was vehemently encored. Master Denton sang very sweetly and added very greatly to the pleasure of the afternoon, winning loud applause and a decided encore when he sang "The little tin soldier." Mr. Perkins, also a visitor, is a thorough musician, and a violinist of the highest order. Thanks cannot be too heartily given given to Miss M. Fowles, who most efficiently discharged the part of accompanist throughout. We should not omit to mention that Mr. Bourne, Manager of the Isle of Wight Railway, readily sent passes for those ladies and gentleman of Ryde who so kindly gave their help. The programme was as foliows : Pianoforte Solo, Ballade (Opus 23rd), Miss H. D. Abbot. Song, "Che faro senza Eurydice," Miss Wallace. Song, "The Token," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Vioiiu Soio i\ D. Perkin, Esq. song " Non é Ver," Miss Jessie Browne. Song, "O fond dove, O fair dove," Master Willie Denton. Pianoforte Solo, " Introduzione and Rondo " from Sonata (Opus 53) Miss H. D. Abbott. Song, "Martin the man-at-arms," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Violin Solo, T. D. Perkins, Esq. Song "Waiting," Miss Jessie Browne. Pianoforte Solo, " Soiree de Vienne valse Caprice," Miss H. D. Abbott. Song, "It was a dream," Miss Wallace. Song, Dudley Watkins, Esq. Song, "The Little Tin Soldier," Master W. Denton.
