THE LOSS OF THE EURYDICE.

The Lord Mayor of London has received the following telegram from Captain Wilaon (H.M.S. Thunderer), Portsea:— "Your telegram has been laid before the general committee of this (Enrydice) fund, and I desired to convey to your lordship the expression of their deep sense of your lordship s consideration in proposing to open a fund for the relief of the distressed relatives of those lost in the Enrydiee, and gratefully accept your offer." Accordingly the Lord Mayor will receive subscriptions at the Mansion House. It is not intended to appoint a committee, his lordship promising to forward all the subscriptions which may entrusted to him to the Portsmouth Committee. The box which was placed outside the Mansion House during the Indian Famine Fund, and proved such a prolific source of income to that fund, is again placed in the same position for the Eurydice relief.

Ventnor. Concert at Ventnor in aid of the Eurydice Distres Fund.

A very excellent entertainment was given last Friday afternoon in the fine coffee room of the Royal Hotel, kindly lent by Mr. Mason, in aid of the Eurydice Distress Fund. We regret to have to say that the attendance was somewhat limited. The names of those who with the greatest good nature came from Ryde and who did so much to make the concert a success, should have provoked a hearty reception from the dwellers in Ventnor. The programme appended will indicate the character of the entertainment ; and as to the several performers, we do not know that we can say more than that each achieved a perfect success. Miss Wallace, daughter of Col. Wallace, of Ryde, who won the unqualified praise of musical critics by her singing at a concert in the Albert Hall, sang as well as we remember to have heard her, and dispite the rule to the contrary, was obliged to submit to an encore. Miss Jessie Browne was suffering from a slight cold, yet fully sustained her reputation, and won rounds of applause. Miss Abbott, who is the daughter of a gentleman visiting Ventnor, is a performer of great finish, and was vehemently encored. Master Denton sang very sweetly and added very greatly to the pleasure of the afternoon, winning loud applause and a decided encore when he sang "The little tin soldier." Mr. Perkins, also a visitor, is a thorough musician, and a violinist of the highest order. Thanks cannot be too heartily given given to Miss M. Fowles, who most efficiently discharged the part of accompanist throughout. We should not omit to mention that Mr. Bourne, Manager of the Isle of Wight Railway, readily sent passes for those ladies and gentleman of Ryde who so kindly gave their help. The programme was as foliows : Pianoforte Solo, Ballade (Opus 23rd), Miss H. D. Abbot. Song, "Che faro senza Eurydice," Miss Wallace. Song, "The Token," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Vioiiu Soio i\ D. Perkin, Esq. song " Non é Ver," Miss Jessie Browne. Song, "O fond dove, O fair dove," Master Willie Denton. Pianoforte Solo, " Introduzione and Rondo " from Sonata (Opus 53) Miss H. D. Abbott. Song, "Martin the man-at-arms," Dudley Watkins, Esq. Violin Solo, T. D. Perkins, Esq. Song "Waiting," Miss Jessie Browne. Pianoforte Solo, " Soiree de Vienne valse Caprice," Miss H. D. Abbott.
