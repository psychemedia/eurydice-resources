At present a boy having served a certain time on board a training-ship is transferred to a flagship, where he becomes an ordinary seaman. He is then draughted to a sea-going ship, and may, under favourable conditions, become an expert and efficient seaman, knowing the name and use of every rope on board, and capable of turning his hands to anything that may be required in the severest weather. It may happen, however, that he is sent to a ram of Rupert type, or a mastless ship like the Devastation where he can learn little or nothing of his profession; and as vessels of these classes are increasing, and likely to increase, it is necessary that special measures should be taken to bestow a thorough sea training upon young seamen, so that they may find themselves at home, no matter what the character of the ship may be to which they are despatched. A step in the right direction has been taken by the fitting out of the Eurydice, a sixth-rate wooden fripate of the old class as a sea-going training-ship for ordinary seamen. The Eurydice is 140ft. in length between perpendiculars. 78ft. in extreme breadth, and 921 tons burthen, old measurement. When ready for commission she will furnish accommodation for 280 young seamen, in addition to her commander and staff of officers. She will carry six 64-pounder 71cwt. guns, mounted on rear truck carriages, three on each side of the main deck. She will be ship rigged, and will probably have an independent commander's commission. Before being draughted for service in sea-going ships young ordinary seamen will undergo a six months' practical training at sea on board the Eurydice, which is totally guiltless of machinery of any kind and it cannot be doubted that the professional schooling which they will thereby receive will go far to improve the efficiency of our seamen as sailors.\\n\\n\\n[This article seems to have been syndicated widely.]\",\n",

      "The Reclamation of Brading Haven.— After many ominous shakes of the head from people residing in the locality of St. Helen's, there can be no doubt that Mr. Seymour has successfully completed the task of keeping back the water from the extensive mud flats which for years have furnished such capital spots for the \" winkler \" and the fowler. The idea of reclaiming the extensive tract of submerged land called Brading Haven, originated with Mr. R J. H. Saunders, C.E., who succeeded in forming a company to provide the requisite capital. No trifling amount was required, for already the amount expended has reached the formidable sum of £80, 000. For this investment the company have some 700 acres of land, and although at present this does not look very promising, there can be little doubt that, in a few years time, there will be a good return from it. At the top of the harbour are what are known as the marshes, a tract of low land which has evidently been at some period reclaimed from the sea by an embankment, and this is stated to be one of tho best pieces of grazing land in the Wight. The farmers say that it fattens beasts extremely well, and some consider this is owing to the salt which still remains in the land. There is every hope, therefore, that in a few years' time the land now reclaimed will be equally good. But the reclamation of the harbour was by no means the whole of the company's scheme. They are now constructing a railway to St. Helen's and Bembridge, and a large portion of the embarking work will also serve to carry the railway. Bembridge is at present a locality very little visited, owing to the difficulty and trouble of reaching it. Horses and carriages have had to go a long way round to get to it. and the pedestrian from Ryde could only shorten the route by crossing a ferry at St. Helen's. Nevertheless, Bembridge is one of the prettiest little places in the Island, and very healthy. Already a number of gentry have settled there, and when it is connected with the other parts of the Island by rail, it will probably soon arrive at the dignity of a town, and the company, who have shown so much enterprise, will reap a rich reward.\n",

      "Could old Sir Hugh Middleton re-visit this earth and again cast his eyes over the watery expanse that lays beyond \"ye ancient borough of Bradinge,\" he would find the desire of his heart accomplished. For two years the navvy has been toiling away St. Helens and Bembridge ; and strong and able workmen under the able direction of Mr. Frederick Seymour have devoted their minds and bodies to one object—to reclaim Brading Haven from the sea. On Thursday last that work was accomplished and over eight hundred acres of what will in the course of a few years be probably fine pasture land were reclaimed from the sea. This land will be the property of the Brading Haven Reclamation Company ; and imagine that its value will more than equal the cost the reclamation. We cordially congratulate Mr Frederick Seymour in having brought so arduous an undertaking to successful termination. The name this gentleman will be handed down to posterity as the one who carried out the mightiest engineering work ever done in this island. Not merely has this gentleman reclaimed 800 acres of land, but the inhabitants of Bembridge and St. Helens have been greatly benefitted by his enterprise in other matters; and we hope that he will meet with substantial recompense for the great work he has accomplished. The Isle Wight is larger by over 800 acres than it was when we went to press last week.— *Ryde Newspaper.* [Mr. F. Seymour has many friends in Jersey].\n",

      "\n",
      "Bembridge and its Prospects. —Our correspondent writes as follows :— I paid a visit to this little village on Tuesday on the occasion of the annual regatta, and was surprised at the change which a few years had made in the locality. Situated at the extreme eastern end of the Island, and cut off from communication with Ryde by the harbour, it has hitherto been so difficult of access as to be quite out of the way of the general tourist and traveller . All this is being altered, and in a few months Bembridge will be as accessible as any other watering place in the Island. Desirous of examining the effects of the new reclamation works which keep back the water from what used to be \" Brading Harbour,\" I walked from Brading to Bembridge along the old shore. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen's side, just above the Mill, and terminating on the Bembridge aide near the Point. The sea is effectually kept out, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, the \"harbour\" now appears to be a brown and barren waste. As the mud banks have dried they I have cracked, and are covered with large fissures. Thousands of oookles, winkles, and sea weeds have come to a dry death in consequenoe of the reclamation, and their dried shells, which smell rather offensively, can be found by hundreds by scraping the surface of the banks. It will not be many years, however, before smiling green fields will make the inhabitants forget that this extensive tract was once covered with water. Here and there a blade of grass, hardier than its fellows, can already be seen sprouting. The new railway runs from the Brading Station by the side of what was the Harbour to St. Helen's Mill, and will cross to Bembridge on the embankment. I noticed that there was still a good deal of water behind the embankment. This is fresh water, brought down by the River Yar, and flows through large flood gates up to the sea. On entering the village I saw a great change even within the last two years. A speculative gentleman, who had great faith in the place, many years ago built a large hotel and a number ot houses, but, no doubt owing to the difficulty of getting to the place, these remained empty for a number of years. I noticed, however, that all the houses were now let, and that a number of visitors were walking about. With a railway brought close to it, I have not the slightest doubt that before many years are past Bembridge will rival Sandown and Shanklin. The arboreal beauties of the place are most striking. Avenues of trees shelter the roads, and the pathway to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of Shanklin Chine. The beach is as good as that of Sandown, and protected by a reef of rocks. Altogether there seems some justification for the inhabitants waking up to a sense of the long-neglected beauties of the locality, and indulging in the confident hope that their prosperous days are at hand.\n",

      "BEMBRIDGE AND ITS REGATTA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the guide books acknowledge the picturesque beauties of the \"little village of Bembridge,\" they also complain of the difficulty of access to it. There have been hitherto no better means of reaching it from Ryde than taking a carriage or walking along the road to St. Helen's, and then crossing the mouth of the harbour at the ferry. This is so very awkward a route, and so extremely hilly, that Bembridge has remained till within the last year or so one of the most out-of-the-way places in the Island. On paying the place a visit on Tuesday, however, we were astonished at the change which about two years had made in the appearance of the locality. This change was almost entirely due to the new reclamation and railway works, which are still incomplete. Arriving at Brading by train, we took the opportunity of getting from thence to Bembridge by skirting along the shores of what used to be Brading Harbour. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen's side just above the water mill, and terminating on the Bembridge side near the Point. This effectually keeps out the sea, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, Brading \"Harbour\" has now the appearance of a desert. The mud-flats are all dried — at least as far as the surface is concerned, — but, remembering certain awful warnings of people who had sunk into treacherous mud up to their knees, we did not venture far. The banks as they have dried have cracked, and are covered with extensive fissures that do not add to their beauty. It has been a sad time for the winkles, cockles, and sea plants. In some sandy places, on scraping the surface, scores of cockles which had been dried up in their shells were found, while there were numerous winkles and sea weed which had met a like sad fate. Through the centre of the reclaimed banks flows a rather large stream called the Yar. It is a curious fact that there are two streams in the Island which go by this name, and this causes some confusion in the minds of the tourists. The stream has been the principal difficulty in carrying out the work, and an exit had to be provided for it by means of flood gates. In a few years time the appearance of the reclaimed land will be as pleasing as it is now the reverse. Nature soon throws her green mantle over the most desolate-looking spots, if there is plenty of water, and doubtless in a few years the inhabitants, viewing the green meadows here, will almost forget that they were once covered by the sea. Even now in some places a blade or two of grass may be seen shooting up. There is little doubt that centuries ago this harbour consisted of smiling fields, upon which the sea burst, either suddenly or by degrees, till 700 acres were covered. In the interesting account of the unsuccessful reclamation by Sir Hugh Middleton, it is stated that in the centre of the harbour a well was found, proving the truth of our statement. The new railway runs by the side of the harbour as far as the mill, and will then cross the embankment to Bembridge, where a station is in course of erection. On entering the village we were struck with the alteration in the appearance of the place, which seemed waking up to a sense of its own importance. The shops had been enlarged and the once desolate looking hotel was occupied. Bembridge happened to have been visited some 30 years ago by one of those unfortunate individuals who \" live before their time.\" Charmed with the beauty of the place, he thought that nothing more was necessary to attract visitors here than to provide accommodation for them. He built a large hotel, and speculated in building, but empty house property soon showed him that something more than natural beauty was required to induce people to reside here. We noticed, however, that all the houses now appeared full, and unmistakable visitors were walking about. A stroll through the place convinced us that it would not be many years before Bembridge would rival Shanklin and Sandown. It has a beach hardly inferior to the latter, and the approach to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of the celebrated chine of the former. Its arboreal beauty is the chief cha- racteristic of tne village, which nas some of the most lovely avenues we have ever seen. No doubt we saw the village at its best on Tuesday, that being the second day of the regatta.\n",

The high tides a few days ago made a breach in the embankment, which has been gradually getting larger and larger, and now the sea has resumed its sway over the whole extent of mud flats which had been dry for some months, and vessels actually go up to the quay at Brading again for chalk. The railway which runs by the side of the harbour is also covered at high tide, and on taking a walk over it on Sunday we noticed that the rails were covered with seaweed, and that sand and shingle were banking up round it in some places. The extent of embankment washed away, in spite of every exertion, is said to be over 70 feet. The work of restoration was put in hand immediately after the breach, and the work is being prosecuted most vigorously, but we understand the embankment will take a different course, so as to avoid the heavy sea wbich runs, in here occasionally.\n",

      "We last Monday paid a visit to the reclamation works at Brading Harbour, and found that the damage which had been done there was quite as great as had been reported. There was one part of the embankment, near the Bembridge side, which had to bear the brunt of the heavy sea which rolls in here. The embankment was sound enough, but nothing had been placed on its sides to keep the sand down in its place. The result was that the extraordinary high tide of a fortnight since washed over it, wetted the sand, which flowed away from the embankment like so much water. In a very short time a breach was made, and the sea had such a hold that it was impossible to stop it. The breach has since reached some 70 yards in width, and the sea has covered the whole of the harbour just the same as it did before the embankment was made. Vessels now come up and down the harbour to Brading Quay for chalk as if nothing had ever happened to check them. On walking down the side of the harbour we noticed that in several places the sea had covered the railway, and that the seaweed had washed over the rails, while the sand and shingle had silted up round them. It is, of course, of the utmost importance that the work should be put right, and a number of men are now at work re-making the embankment, which, we believe, will cross the harbour at a different point than it did before. Mr. Seymour has entered into a fresh contract to complete the work, and it is rumoured that his estimate of the cost of the new work required is £10,000. Mr. R. J. H. Saunders, the engineer of the company, writing to a contemporary, thus explains the cause of the accident : \" You will, no doubt, have heard that the extraordinary tide of last Friday night passed over the unfinished work at Bembridge, and within a very few hours a breach was made in the embankment so that the sea now flows again over the land reclaimed in June last. This is, of course, very disappointing, as the work was nearly completed along the whole length, and was everywhere considerably higher than the previous extraordinary tide. There was, therefore, no apprehension or thought of danger, and consequently no precautions were taken. This will, however, be a warning in the future to make assurance doubly sure, and to leave no point undefended. You will be pleased to learn that the work of restoration has already been put in hand. The directors were over the works yesterday with Mr. Grantham, the consulting engineer of the company, when, after very careful consideration of the whole question, it was unhesitatingly decided to prosecute the work vigorously, and an agreement was entered into for carrying it out at once with Mr. F. Seymour, the contractor, and I have every reason to believe I shall within two or three months have the satisfaction of informing you that the sea has been effectually shut out.\"\n",

Indeed he might say that he was one of its originators, and had the honour of being the first Chairman of the line. For a great numberof years he was a director, and, although circumstances compelled him to give up that post for a time, he was glad when he was able to join the directorate again. He had pleasure in knowing that the Company was exceedingly well served, their manager being a most excellent judge of character, and having surrounded himself with a number of most trustworthy officials.

Wooldridge gave the \"Engineer and Manager, Mr. Joseph Bourne,\" whose name was very warmly received, and on whose behalf Mr. Shaw, an old servant of the Company, responded.—Mr. Shaw next gave \"The Companies in connection,\" and referred to the great works which the joint Railway Companies were now carrying out at Ryde. These works were now in a very forward state, and it would not be long before they would be able to run a train to the Pier gates, and a very little longer before they could take them to the end of the Pier. The overland companies had gone to enormous expense in carrying out these works, and he believed it was also intended to improve the communication by water. He was sure that all these improvements could not fail to be beneficial to the inhabitants of the Island. There was another small railway in connection with theirs—the Brading Harbour Company, which, like the rest, could, not fail to feed the main line.—Capt. Seymour responded, and said that he had been connected with the Company last mentioned, who had spent over 100,000l. in the endeavour to shut out the sea from Brading Harbour. The undertaking, it was thought, was successfully accomplished,  his contract was at an end, and it was thought there remained nothing more to do, when unfortunately the sea again proved the master, The Company then came to him once more, and, with the pluck of Englishmen, resolved to try again, but whether they would succeed he was not yet able to say.—Mr. J. S. Elgee responded for the \" London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company,\" and Mr. Frederick Fowles for the \"South-Wesern.\" The remaining toasts were: \"The Chairman,\" \"Vice-Chairman\", \" The Visitors,\" (humurously responded to by Mr. Dudley Watkins), \"The Secretary of the Entertainment, Mr. Geo. Henley,\" \"The Press,\" and \"The Ladies.\" The meeting did not break up till a late,.\n",

      "RECLAIMING LAND FROM THE SEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Engraving represents a view of the entrance to Brading Haven, Isle of Wight, at low water, and a portion the new embankment recently constructed to reclaim the Haven from the sea. It was until recently a large tract marshy ground, with a bold inlet of the sea, at high water, covering all the low lands between Bembridge and St. Helen’s, about eight to nine hundred acres being overflowed by the sea every tide. Originally this marshy ground was greater extent; but a portion was reclaimed in the reign Edward I. by Sir William Bessel, then warden the island. In 1594 German Richards, Esq., made an acquisition mill, marsh, and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge. In the reign of James I. an attempt on a grand scale was made by Sir Hugh Myddleton to inclose, and recover the haven from the sea; but after an expenditure of £7000 it was discovered that much of the recovered land was a light, running sand; and, finally, after various experiments, the project came to disastrous issue. In April, 1877, the “Brading Haven Reclamation Company accepted a tender of Mr. Frederick Seymour, of Bembridge (who had previously constructed the railway from Brading to St. Helen’s), for the construction of an embankment to reclaim the land contained in the Haven; which arduous work was successfully completed on Feb. 22 last, thus adding 800 acres of valuable land to the Isle of Wight. It is intended to continue the railway on the new embankment (which is one mile in length) from St. Helen’s to Bembridge. As, doubtless, many of our readers know, Bembridge is a village of great beauty, clothed in leaf and shade, nestling at the foot of Bembridge Down. It is an extremely picturesque spot, but, having previously been out of the ordinary track, has attracted but little notice. It is, however, well worthy of a visit, and its many retired nooks afford capital accommodation for picnics. Its sands, too, are firm and smooth, and offer good opportunities for sea-bathing. The view from the summit of Bembridge Down is the finest in the island. To the north the eye looks over the gently swelling grounds of St. Helen’s and sea view to Ryde; and, when glancing over the Solent, with fits majestic ships, commands the harbour of Portsmouth, Hayling Island, and the line of the Hampshire and Sussex coasts, where the slender spire of Chichester Cathedral may be seen pointing heavenwards —while the coast terminates in the blue haze which marks the position of Beachy Head. To the south is beheld Sandown Bay, with its loamy cliffs alternately rising and sinking, until they tower in the gigantic mass of Dunmore and Shanklin Down. To the west the eye commands a wide view of the inland hills and valleys ; immediately below, the Yar winds its sinuous way through the green pastures of Brading Haven. Now that the land has been reclaimed and the facilities for reaching Bembridge are improved, in all probability this will become one of the favourite watering places in the Isle of Wight.\n",

      "\n",
      "On Monday afternoon an old-fashioned but at the same time very pleasing custom was celebrated at the Priory, where the tenants of tbe Manor of \" St. Hellenes, otherwise Eddington,\" attended a Court Baron called by the Lard of tbe Manor, Mr. Henry Grose-Smith. Mr. J. Binfield Bird having read the annual proclamation, the following were sworn as the \" homage\" : — William Dash (foreman), Benjamin Dash, Emanuel Wade, C. Midlane, James Nash, and William Joseph Nash. — A number of alterations which had occurred since the last court was held were noted, and the representatives of several persons deceased \" took up their admissions.\" Mr. Midlane was noted as having encroached on land belonging to Mr. Smith, which, however, he did not admit, and the Court determined to view the spot in dispute. The construction of a road along tbe south-west side of St. Helen's Green by the Brading Harbour Railway Company was reported, and Mr. Bird reoommended that the company be \" amersed\" in the annual sum of 5s.— The Lord of the Manor observed that he thought they had better fix the amount at a nominal sum, inasmuch as the road was a great public convenience.— Mr. Allen asked who would receive the money ?— Mr. Bird said the Lord of the Manor, of course. — Mr. Allen : By what right does he receive it ? — Mr. Grose-Smith said he was owner of the soil of the Green as Lord of the Manor, and it was his duty, in conjunction with that court, to see that the wastes of the manor were not infringed upon. All such infringements were to be presented to the Court Baron of the Homage, who could deal with them as they liked — inflict a penalty, or even order auch infringement to be put back. In this case it was a great advantage to have the road as an approach to the Railway Station, but he thought they ought to inflict a fine just to get an acknowledgment that the company had encroached on the waste. On the suggestion of Mr Midlane it was eventually decided to \" amerse\" the Railway Company in the sum of 1s.\n",

      "The Haven.— In 1781, Sir Richard Worsley, in his famous History of the Island, considered it, worthy to chronicle the Haven \" us a large tract of marshy ground, containing 856 acres, covered every tide by the sea.\" The recovery of so large a piece of land from the sea had been long an object in contemplation, and Sir John Oglander had preserved accounts of several undertakings for this purpose. A part of Brading Haven was taken in by Sir William Russell, Lord of Yaverland (Warder of the Isle of Wight, in the reign of Edward I.), at the time when Yarbridge was erected. In the year 1562, another parcel of land was walled in from the sea by Mr George Oglander and Mr German Richards, when the North-marsh and some adjoining lands qere gained, and in 1594 a third acquisition was made of Mill-marsh and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge by Mr Edward Richards. The next attempt was of a more extensive nature ; a grant ot the Haven was obtained from King James the 1st, by Gibbs, a groom of the bed chamber. The owners of the adjoining lands contested this grant, which the King was very earnest in supporting. After a verdict obtained in the exchequer against the gentlemen of the Island, Gibbs sold his share for £2000 to Sir Bevis Thelwwall, a page of the King's bed chamber, who admitted the famous sir Hugh Miiddletou to a share from the sea. The first taking of it in cost £4000, and £1000 more were expended in building a dwelling house, barn, a watermill, trenching, quick setting, and other necessary works, so that, including the original purchase, the total expenditure amounted to £7000. But after all, the nature of the ground did not answer the expectations of the undertakers, for though that part of it adjoining Brading proved tolerably good, nearly one half of it was found to be a light running sand. Nevertheless as incontestible evidence appeared, by the discovery of a well cased with stone near the middle of the Haven, that it had formerly been good ground Sir Hugh Middleton tried a variety of experiments on the land which had been taken in before he sold his share, sowing it with wheat, barley, oats, cabbage, and finally with rape seed, which last was most successful. But the greatest discouragement was that the sea brought up so much ooze, weeds and sand, which choked up the passage for the discharge of the fresh water. At length, in a wet season, When the inner part of the Haven was full of water, and a high spring tide, the water met under the bank and made a breach. Thus ended this expensive project, and though Sir John Oglander, who lived in the neighbourhood confessed himself a friend to the undertaking, he declared it as his opinion that the scheme could never be resumed to any profitable purpose, and the following estimate in 1699 of the expenses necessary to recover it shews that the enclosing was again in contemplation :\n",

We however, hope the Brading Harbour Reclamation Company have followed the wise advice of the old surveyor and made some difference in the range and valuation of the line of the wall, from the unfortunate lines of Sir Hugh Middleton and his partner. and that they have mingled with the clay used in their wall some other proper material, and may it prove the estimated profit or recompense of the old surveyor will be far exceeded.— Communicated.\n",

      "THE HARBOUR AND RAILWAY.—An extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Brading Harbour Improvement and Railway Company was held at 19, Walbrook, E.C., on Monday, for the purpose of approving the Bill now before Parliament. The meeting was of a purely formal character, and lasted only a few minutes. Under the Bill it is proposed to revive the powers granted under the Act of 1874, particularly with reference to the construction of the railway between St. Helens and Bembridge, commencing near the St. Helens Quay, on the of Wight Company's branch line, and ending at Bembridge Railway Station, which is now in a forward state of completion. The railway will run immediately inside the concrete embankment. The Bill will confer on the Southwestern and Brighton and the I.W. Railway Companies power to construct, maintain, and work this new railway, and will authorise the Brading Company to sell or lease their railway to either of these Companies. The Bill also gives power to the Brading Company to purchase or lease steam or sailing vessels for the conveyance of passengers and goods between Brading Harbour and Hayling Island. Portsmouth, and Southampton. The Company likewise seeks power to form roads and grant building and other leases on the reclaimed land. We understand that the new railway will he complete and open for traffic this summer, and it will be the means of opening out to visitors and tourists oue of the prettiest parts of the Island, which has hitherto been neglected on account of its difficulty of sccess. Immediately opposite the Bembridge Railway Station, and facing the entrance of the Brading Harbour, a large hotel is being built, and will be finished and opened before the summer.\n",

      "\n",
      "Brading Harbour Improvement Works (Additional Powers) Bill.— The Chairman said that the meeting had been called to consider the new Bill of the Brading Harbour Company, whereby they sought to obtain additional powers. The only clause in their Bill which affected that Board was that whereby the company sought powers to stop up certain easements. This would apply to the watercourse, by which the water on the sewage farm at St Helen's escaped. If this easement were stopped the Board would have to go to the expense of constructing a sewer to divert it outside the company's works. He considered that by the Railway Act the company ought to make this diversion.— The Clerk said he found that the sanction of the Local Government Board to carry out the sewage works at St Helen's was obtained in 1873, and that in the following year Mr Allen carried out the work. The Companies' Act was passed in 1874, so there was nothing he thought to exempt the company from the provisions of the Railway Act.— The Chairman said that the sewage of their farm, after it had been used, went down this waterway into the harbour. The company had turned this harbour into dry land, and the company now said they intended to contest their right to carry the water into the harbour. By the Railway Act, if the company interfered with any drains or water courses, they were bound to provide others as good.— Mr Moody said he understood that the company said they did not come into the Local Board district at all.— The Clerk said there was the station. —— Mr Moody: That is empty now.— The Clerk : They must pay rates for it as soon as it is occupied.— Mr Moody said it did not look as if the harbour was dry land that morning. There was as much water there as ever there was.— The Chairman : Fresh water, I suppose. — Mr Moody : Yes. — The Chairman said there was a difference between a fresh water lake and the sea. If the harbour had been a fresh water lake they could not have discharged sewage into it, but as the harbour was an arm of the sea when they first discharged sewage water into it, there was nothing to prevent them doing so, and the company having interfered with them was bound to reinstate their \"easement\" if they stopped it up.— Mr Glynn said they must recollect that the harbour was private property. The company bought it off the Oglander family, and they would not have done so if the Oglander family had not the right to sell. Then again, the Board did not discharge sewage into the harbour. — The Chairman : No, but the water is highly impregnated with sewage. The question was, would the company come to any arrangement with the Board as to diverting it ? — Mr Moody : It would be an immense amount of work.— The Chairman : No, I think not very great. — The Surveyor was called in and questioned— He said that to make a sewer to divert the watercourse would cost about £200. They would have to carry it about 300 yards to get it past the oyster beds. They would have to take it right to the Duver.— Mr Glynn : That wouldn't do.— The Chairman said the question was whether they could come to some arrangement to avoid the necessity of opposing the company. The General Act did not say a word about sewers.— Mr Bell asked if any communication had been made to the company in order to see whether they would come to terms. — The Clerk said they wrote to the company's solicitors telling them about this easement or overflow of water from this sewage farm, and telling them they must provide for it. In reply, they said they must oppose. — After some further discussion, on the motion of Mr Glynn, it was resolved to take all necessary steps for opposing the Bill, and to pay the necessary expenses of such opposition out of the general district rate.— The Clerk (Mr Vincent) was also instructed to get a petition prepared and lodged if necessary.— It was also resolved to take counsel's opinion on the matter.\n",

      "\n",
      "A public meeting of the ratepayers of St Helen's district was held at St Peter's school room on Saturday last, to consider whether they should support the Local Board in opposing the above Bill now before ParUament. The Chairman of the Local Board (Mr H. Stone) occupied the chair, and amongst those present were the Rev J. T. Almy, Messrs Moody, S. Caws, N. Caws, Calloway, Matthews, Allen, and Capt Fendall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chairman said the meeting was called to obtain their sanction to oppose the Bill, the Local Board having agreed to it at their last meeting. The Board had no wish to recklessly spend the money of the ratepayers, for if they did that they would be spending their own money individuaUy, as some of the members of the Board were large ratepayers. The clause in the new Bill which they wished to oppose was the 21st, which was to the effect that all rights, interests, easements, and privileges of and kind whatsoever existing in respect of the whole or any part of the lands acquired by the company other than the rights, easements, and privileges of the company, and any person, corporation, company, or association claiming them or under them, in, over, or in respect of such land or any part thereof, shall henceforth absolutely cease, and be for ever extinguished. If that clause passed in that form, he need scarcely tell them that the whole of their surface drainage might be stopped, and there would be no means of opposing the action taken by the company. It was declared by the section that all the Board's rights in respect to the existing easements shall cease, and this was against the spirit of general legislation. What they wanted at present was to guard against the action that might be taken by the company to prevent them using the easements for their surface drainage without substituting another. If they could obtain an undertaking from the company to substitute another easement, they would not proceed any further in the matter. The present Bill had been sprung upon them uuawares, and it had passed standing orders, and the ParUamentary agents said that th«y must file a petition by next Thursday to be in time for opposing. He had written to Mr Freeman, the chairman of the company, to obtain an interview on the subject, to endeavour to come to an amicable arrangement, but that gentleman was away, and he expected to have seen him that morning. He would see him at the earliest opportunity, but it was necessary to obtain the sanction of the public meeting at once.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Chairman replied that he could not give any idea as to the costs, but he believed that the Oglander trustees and the Commissioners would be opposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rev J. T. Almy said that the fact of their lodging the petition would not necessitate their fighting the battle. He thought that if they could make a joint movement it would save expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chairman said that the Oglander trustees thought it better to take separate action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Matthews remarked that the company hadn't defined the boundary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chairman replied that if they had known that before the company sent up their Bill, they might have prevented its passing the standing orders. On their plans the boundary line was wrong. A desultory conversation ensued, and it was ultimately decided to support the action of the Board.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the Portsmouth County Court, on Thursday in last week, the Brading Harbour Improvement Company sued ab arge owner, named Thompson, for £16 5s. cost of repairs for damage done to harbour improvements by alleged careless management of a barge, of which tbe defendant was owner, in the early part of December.— Mr. G. H. King defended.— It appears that at the time stated the barge Jane, in charge of one man, went into Brading Harbour on a strong tide. Some of the men in the employ of the company, seeing tbe danger of the barge running into some of the posts and woodwork, called to the man to let go his anchor, which he did. The anchor, however, dragged for a long distance, and, when a hold was obtained, the ring fastening the anohor to tbe chain broke, and the barge drifted down on to the piles, breaking several and doing other damage to the amount claimed. There had been a danger buoy placed at the mouth of the harbour; but the witnesses for plaintiffs could not say whether there was a danger board on it at the time of the accident. One was placed there afterwards, when the engineer also had a chain placed across the harbour. — His Honour gave judgment for the plaintiffs for £10.\n",

Thompson. — This action was heard at the Portsmouth County Court on Thursday, in which it was sought to recover £16 5s., the costs of repairs of damage done through negligent navigation of the barge Jane, of which defendant is the owner. From the evidence it appeared that at the end of December the barge entered Brading harbour with a strong tide, and having only one man on board, who seemed unable to manage it, the vessel drifted helplessly towards the piles erected in the improvement of the harbour. The man employed on the works shouted to the bargeman to throw a line and let go the anchor, but it was stated the man \" lost his head\" through fear, with the consequence that the anchor chain broke and the vessel, colliding with the piles, caused the damage to the amount of the claim. — Mr. Ring appeared for the defendants, and argued that it was purely an accident. — His Honour gave judgment for £10.\n",

There was a meeting on Monday, the 9th, at which complainant attended, and defendant's books were gone through by Mr. R. Seymour, the time keeper. It was then found that defendant had not accounted for several sums which had been paid to him by the cashier for the past nine months. On Friday, the 11th, the complainant, in company with another, went to defendant and demanded an account of the the sums which had been paid in by the cashier, a list of which was handed to defendant. Defendant became very abusive and assaulted him in a very violent manner.— Complainant stated that when he went to defendant under the circumstances detailed, defendant struck him with his fist on the temple and almost rendered him insensible. — The other evidence given was rather contradictory, a witness called by defendant asserting that very high words passed between the two parties in the course of which complainant put his fist in defendant's face.\n",

      "At the County Petty Sessions on Tuesday, John Cook, of St. Helen's, time keeper on the Brading Harbour Improvement Works, was charged with falsifying certain accounts, with the intention of emhezzling various sums of money. It appeared that it was the prisoner's duty to go round the works and ascertain each day how long the men had worked, entering the particulars on printed pay sheets, together with the total amounuts due to each man. The money was paid on Saturday morning, and if any of the men did not call for it, it was left at the canteen. In this instance prisoner entered the names of three men, who it was proved had not been on the works, in the pay sheet, and credited them with various sums, amounting altogether to between two and three pounds. The resident engineer (Mr. Walker) discovered the fraud and taxed the prisoner with putting dummy men on the pay sheet. Prisoner did uot deny it and asked to be forgiven.—He was committed for trial at the Sessions.\n"
