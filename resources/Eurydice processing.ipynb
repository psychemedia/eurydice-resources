At present a boy having served a certain time on board a training-ship is transferred to a flagship, where he becomes an ordinary seaman. He is then draughted to a sea-going ship, and may, under favourable conditions, become an expert and efficient seaman, knowing the name and use of every rope on board, and capable of turning his hands to anything that may be required in the severest weather. It may happen, however, that he is sent to a ram of Rupert type, or a mastless ship like the Devastation where he can learn little or nothing of his profession; and as vessels of these classes are increasing, and likely to increase, it is necessary that special measures should be taken to bestow a thorough sea training upon young seamen, so that they may find themselves at home, no matter what the character of the ship may be to which they are despatched. A step in the right direction has been taken by the fitting out of the Eurydice, a sixth-rate wooden fripate of the old class as a sea-going training-ship for ordinary seamen.

When ready for commission she will furnish accommodation for 280 young seamen, in addition to her commander and staff of officers. She will carry six 64-pounder 71cwt. guns, mounted on rear truck carriages, three on each side of the main deck. She will be ship rigged, and will probably have an independent commander's commission. Before being draughted for service in sea-going ships young ordinary seamen will undergo a six months' practical training at sea on board the Eurydice, which is totally guiltless of machinery of any kind and it cannot be doubted that the professional schooling which they will thereby receive will go far to improve the efficiency of our seamen as sailors.\\n\\n\\n[This article seems to have been syndicated widely.]\",\n",

For many years, the fleet had been moving over to armoured steamships and rigged sailing ships were no longer appropriate for modern naval warfare. However, it was still felt that sailors should still be able to handle traditionally rigged vessels and that training ratings on them would be to their benefit as seamen.\\n\\n![](../images/ILN_1878_loss_of_euridyce_apr_06_011.jpg)\\nIllustrated London News â€” H.M.S. Eurydice as she lay in Portsmouth harbour before her last voyage - from a photograph, April 6, 1878\\n\\n## On the Training of Sailors\\n\\nThe Eurydice was thus converted over to a training ship in the Spring of 1877, before embarking on a voyage to the West Indies in Autumn 1877.'),\n",

At present a boy having served a certain time on board a training-ship is transferred to a flagship, where he becomes an ordinary seaman. He is then draughted to a sea-going ship, and may, under favourable conditions, become an expert and efficient seaman, knowing the name and use of every rope on board, and capable of turning his hands to anything that may be required in the severest weather. It may happen, however, that he is sent to a ram of Rupert type, or a mastless ship like the Devastation where he can learn little or nothing of his profession; and as vessels of these classes are increasing, and likely to increase, it is necessary that special measures should be taken to bestow a thorough sea training upon young seamen, so that they may find themselves at home, no matter what the character of the ship may be to which they are despatched. A step in the right direction has been taken by the fitting out of the Eurydice, a sixth-rate wooden fripate of the old class as a sea-going training-ship for ordinary seamen. The Eurydice is 140ft. in length between perpendiculars. 78ft. in extreme breadth, and 921 tons burthen, old measurement. When ready for commission she will furnish accommodation for 280 young seamen, in addition to her commander and staff of officers. She will carry six 64-pounder 71cwt. guns, mounted on rear truck carriages, three on each side of the main deck. She will be ship rigged, and will probably have an independent commander's commission. Before being draughted for service in sea-going ships young ordinary seamen will undergo a six months' practical training at sea on board the Eurydice, which is totally guiltless of machinery of any kind and it cannot be doubted that the professional schooling which they will thereby receive will go far to improve the efficiency of our seamen as sailors.\\n\\n\\n[This article seems to have been syndicated widely.]\"),\n",

A little bit of digging turns up the following history of the cable that presumably carried the telegram signal.\\n\\n```{admonition} Great Western Telegraph Company\\n:class: seealso dropdown\\n\\nTelegraph Cables (1899)\\nby C.

He experimented with rubber insulation for electric cables and eventually found a way of insulating cables in a continuous process.\\nc.1857 or later: The Indian Government placed Hooper\\'s first order, followed by another order for cable to link India and Ceylon.
