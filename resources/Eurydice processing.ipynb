At present a boy having served a certain time on board a training-ship is transferred to a flagship, where he becomes an ordinary seaman. He is then draughted to a sea-going ship, and may, under favourable conditions, become an expert and efficient seaman, knowing the name and use of every rope on board, and capable of turning his hands to anything that may be required in the severest weather. It may happen, however, that he is sent to a ram of Rupert type, or a mastless ship like the Devastation where he can learn little or nothing of his profession; and as vessels of these classes are increasing, and likely to increase, it is necessary that special measures should be taken to bestow a thorough sea training upon young seamen, so that they may find themselves at home, no matter what the character of the ship may be to which they are despatched. A step in the right direction has been taken by the fitting out of the Eurydice, a sixth-rate wooden fripate of the old class as a sea-going training-ship for ordinary seamen. The Eurydice is 140ft. in length between perpendiculars. 78ft. in extreme breadth, and 921 tons burthen, old measurement. When ready for commission she will furnish accommodation for 280 young seamen, in addition to her commander and staff of officers. She will carry six 64-pounder 71cwt. guns, mounted on rear truck carriages, three on each side of the main deck. She will be ship rigged, and will probably have an independent commander's commission. Before being draughted for service in sea-going ships young ordinary seamen will undergo a six months' practical training at sea on board the Eurydice, which is totally guiltless of machinery of any kind and it cannot be doubted that the professional schooling which they will thereby receive will go far to improve the efficiency of our seamen as sailors.\\n\\n\\n[This article seems to have been syndicated widely.]\",\n",

      "\n",
      "BRADING HARBOUR\n",
      "\n",
      "In accordance with a requisition, a public meeting wan convened by the Rev. John Le Mesurier (vicar), and churchwardens, in the girls' school-room, Bembridge, to consider the best means of preserving rights and privileges of the inhabitants of Bembridge in respect to Brading Harbour. The Rev. J. le Mesurier occupied the chair, and the meeting was well-represented by all classes more or less interested ia the harbour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first called upon Capt. John Douglas McDonald, R.N., who was the means of gettiag the requisition signed for convening the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain MCDONALD commenced by raying theta did not wish to put himself prominently forward on this question, but by pure accident it came to his knowledge that they were being defrauded out of their rights and privileges in the Brading Harbour. They were specially indebttd to a friend in London to whom he wrote for information. All the replies in  answer to letters were to the effect that they were too late. He did not wish to be done, however, so he started a letter off at once to the authorities, which he would read later on. In the first place all this had arisen from the negligence of that parish in not attending to what was in print prior to 1874. He thought everyone was taken in by the heading \"to get an Act of Parliament for the improvment of Brading Harbour and works attached.' Not to start under any wrong impression, he did not think there was anyone present who did not wish to see a railway or good road—(hear, hear),—or an improvment to the harbour, and would not mind paying a little toll, but they would all like to have some part of the beach left to them as a public right of way. This the company had obtained, and it was now actual law, and, as far as he could understand, they could not move anywhere on the beach without paying a toll. He, for one, wished to live in Bembridge for some years to come, and would not put up with that without a struggle, and he hoped they would all join in using lawful means to avert such a thing. The the tolls they would have to pay, if the Act was allowed to proceed, would be more than the public taxes in any part of the Kingdom. Feeling this very deeply he wrote officially to the Board of Trade and to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. He had been in correspondence with a friend in town for some time before that. The letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty was to the following effect :—\n",
      "\n",
      "I beg to call the attention of their Lordships to he above-named Act, which has given full power to a company to enclose the harbour now existing at Bembridge, or, at least, to reduce its proportions as to render it of little service. When I state from the best authority that over 655 vessels of the usual coasting craft, carrying coals, timber, &c., entered the harbour during the year 1876, of which number about 600 discharged their cargo at the quay at Brading, the rest either at St. Helen's or here, you can form some estimate of the value of Brading Harbour as it now exists. Moreover, it is the resort of all the pilot vessels, fishing craft, small yachts, &c., in this locality, most of whom have moorings laid down in the bight of the harbour. Also numerous yachts are in the habit of being laid up here for the winter. Under the above state of the case I trust their Lordships will hesitate to give their sanction to clause 38 contained in the said Act, without a full and complete inquiry into the merits of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar letter was sent to the Board of Trade, and the following was their reply :—\n",
      "\n",
      "I am directed by the Board of trade to acknoledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ult., on the subject of tho works which the Brading Harbour Improvement and Pier Company propose to construct inn Brading Haven, in pursuance of the authority conferred upon them by the above Act. In reply. I am to point out, as indeed your letter admits, that Parliament has authorised the construction of the embankment to which you object. It has further, by the 38th section at the Act to which you call attention, conferred on the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the duty of approving of the working drawings, and I am to observe that is it obvious that the Board of Trade have no power to repeal or alter an Act of Parliament.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not got a reply from the Admiralty, but they would hear that that was going on all right, and that it was their sheet anchor. With reference to the reply from the Board of Trade, he would say they ought not to have signed away the  public right of water. The speaker then quoted from \"Phear\" on the rights of water. This harbour, fortunately for them, happened to be under the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and was enclosed in the plan furnished to the authorities at Portsmouth. No shingle could be taken away without their permissionm and their rights extended up to Brading. HE wanted them now to select a committee to act in the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain John Macdonald, R.N., then explained the differnce between the original and amended plan, and it was clearly shown that if carried out Brading Harbout would be a harbout of refuge no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different sections of the Act were then read, including schedule of charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr de Pass next addressed the meeting, and on one or two points he differed from the previous speaker. He argued that it would be of no use for them to endeavour to upset the whole Act of Parliament, but they should bring all their forces to bear to keep the company to their first plan. The difference between the first and second plan was in having a harbour for vessels or having no harbour. (Hear, hear.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain McDonald said he quite agreed with regard to the old plen, but there was one one thing they had forgotten—that was about the tolls which could be levied even when the old plans were completed. It had been an open place in the harbour from time immemorial, and as long as he could stir a hand in the matter a toll should not be paid unless the people had a place to land their boats. (Hear, hear.) If they had a harbour they wanted a free one. (Appllause.) If the choice was between a harbour and a railway he would rather have the harbour. If the harbour was shut up where were the fishermen, &c., to get their bait. (Hear, hear.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. de Pass: Two plans had been deposited. The first plan might hare been opposed successfully and there would have been an end to it. Now the company had deposited a second, which meant to shut up the harbour entirely, which would be great oppression. The original Act was named the \"Bembridge Improvement Act\". The people of Bembridge went to sleep—(laughter)—and did not go to Brading to see the Act. The Act was passed for the improvement of Bembridge, and they believed it to be an improvement till their eyes were opened, and saw that this little part of their rights was being taken away. Bembridge Harbour was free, and if the people of Brading liked to allow their harbor to be shut up, it was their affair, but he did not think they would allow it. He did not think it could be closed up by the signature of any party unless it was proved that no real good could accrue to Bembridge without destroying the harbour. He afterwards referred to the tolls, and argued that they would be obliged to come down as the public would not patronise the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain McDonlaod said that according to the plans they were not allowed the smallest portion as being free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Clayton advocated forming a committee at once, which wasaccordingly done, consisting of the following:— Captain McDonald, Captain Clayton, Messrs. T. E. Osborn, Searl, W. W. Osborne, Mursell, Weaver, Damp and Jones.\n",

      "\n",
      "Brading Harbour, although a pretty sheet of water at high tide, presents nothing but a vast expanse of mud flats when tbe water is out, and the channel, which runs between them to Brading quay, is very intricate. Nowhere does the water flow over the mud flats more than two or three feet, and nothing is easier tban for a vessel to get aground in making her way up the harbour. The celebrated Hugh Middleton, the engineer who did so much for the water supply of London, as long ago as the 17th century, is said to have conceived the idea of reclaiming these mud flats, and converting them into arable land, but owing to tbe defective engineering appliances of those days, he did net succeed, and old inhabitants of St. Helen's say that wood work aid other relics of his attempt existed till quite recently. A company has been formed with much the same object in view as Hugh Middleton, with the addition of a railway. They are now actively at work, and have already reclaimed a plot of land at Bembridge, which will be converted into a railway station. An embankment is now being constructed across tbe harbour to shut out the sea, and thus reclaim about 800 acres of land. A large quay will be made at St. Helen's Mill, where goods will be landed and carried by railway to Brading. instead of being taken by boats. The entrance to the harbour will also be improved, so that vessels of larger burden can enter. A railway is now in course of construction for the conveyance of passengers to Bembridge and St. Helen's. As both these are pretty places, and possess a good beach, there seems every probability that they will, ere long, become watering places of importance.\n",

      "THE RECLAMATION OF BRADING HAVEN.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may not be uninteresting to many of our Isle of Wight readers, now that the reclamation of Brading Harbour is a work in progress, to know that such a work was attempted so far back as 1616, by Sir Hugh Myddleton, whose successful enterprise in connection with the New River Company has given him enduring fame. Smiles, in his \" Lives of Engineers,\" refers to this work, and says that it is probable \" that, at some early period, neither swamp nor lake existed at Brading Haven, but a green and fertile valley, for in the course of tbe works undertaken by Sir Hugh for its recovery from the sea, a well, strongly cased with stone, was discovered near the middle of the Haven, indicating tbe existence of a former settled pppulation on the soil. The sea must, however, have burst in and destroyed the settlement, layiug the whole valley under water. In King James's reign, when the recovering of drowned lands began to receive an unusual degree of attention, the project of reclaiming Brading Haven was again revived; and in the year 1616 a grant was made of the drowned lands to one John Gibb, the King reserving to himself a rental of £20 per annum •• • It appears that Gibb sold his right to one Sir Bevis Thelwall, who at once invited Sir Hugh Myddleton to join him in undertaking the work. • • • A satisfactory arrangement having been made with the King, Myddleton began tne work of reclaiming the Haven in the course of tbe same year (1620). He sent to Holland for Dutch workmen, familiar with such undertakings, and it is obvious that be mainly followed the Dutch method of reclamation, although it would also appear that be also employed some invention of his own. No description is given of the paiticular method a opted by Sir Hugh in forming his embankment, but it would appear that he proceeded by driving piles into the bottom oi the Haven, near Bembridge Point, where it is about the narrowest, and thus formed a strong embankment at its junction with the sea, but, as would appear, without making adequate provision for the egress of the inland waters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A very curious contemporary manuscript by Sir John Oglander, is still preserved amongst the archives of the Oglander family, who hold a great part of the ueighbounng land, from which it would appear that after the ground was recovered, it was not of much value. The best portion was that nearest Brading ; 200 acres were worth about 6s 8d the acre, and all the rest about 2s 6d the acre (!). Wheat, barley, cabbage, and oats, all failed to grow on it ; but rape succeeded best ; all the others came to nothing. At last, on the 8th of May, 1630, there came a very high spring tide, when the sea made a breach, and, not being attended to soon euougb, got worse and worse, till at last it was all covered again with the sea. The total amount lost in the attempt is said to be about £7000. The manuscript referred to further says that though the country people were much against the reclamation of the harbour, yet it \" caused a great deal more health in tbese parts than was ever known before.\" The gates whioh served for a sluice were dug up some years ago near the boatbouse on St. Helen's, \" Duvver.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "On Saturday last the men engaged on these works were entertained at dinner by employer, Mr. F. Seymour, as a token of his good feeling towards them for the assistance they have given him in carrying out his contract. A large iron house was erected for the occasion on Bembridge point, and most tastefully decorated. Flags of all aatioas were gracefully draped around the walls, running from end to end of the building, while handsome mottoes, expressing welcome and good will to the men, were plentiful. At intervals, showing out between the flags, were stars formed of new shovels and pick-axes, and from the ceiliug hung a battered old navvy's barrow, a true emblem of hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chair was occupied by Mr. Frederick Seymour, with the Rev. Le Mesurier on the right, and the vice-chair by Mr. Pinchbeck. Three hundred of the *employes* and men sat down to an excellent dinner, beautifully served up, and entirely cooked by the men. The scene was most imposing, the tables admirably laid, and everything of the best provided, while choice flowers ornamented the dessert. More surprising was the manner in which the several dishes were served up and cooked owing to the difficulty of finding cooking accommodation. — Grace having been said by the Rev. J. Le Mesurier, Mr. Seymour proposed the health of the Queen, the Royal Family, and the Army and Navy, which toast he felt sure would be heartily responded to, especially as owing to the unsettled state of affairs in the East nobody could tell when the service ot the latter might be required, and he felt sure that with men of the physique those present, her Majesty's &dominions were in safe keeping.—The toast was received with hearty cheers, showing that everyone present believed in maintaining the prestige of the mother country.—In the absence of any military or naval guest, Mr. Le Mesurier kindly returned thanks, and then addressed the men, complimenting them on their excellent conduct hitherto, and saying he should always he happy to assist any individual of their number with his advice. Order re-established, and the men's glasses having been filled with wine, Mr. Seymour mild: Brother working men, I wish to propose a toast which I feel sure you will receive with hearty good-will, and that is the health of the Bradiiig Harbour Company, and their Chairman, Mr. Spencer Balfour, for you must not forget it is owing to them that we are met today in this friendly way ; you must also recollect that although every week you look to me for your wages, I have to look to them for the necessary funds to carry out this great undertaking, which have always been forthomniug. In all our undertakings through life we dependent on each other, and it is union which gives strength. In your case you depend on the contractor, the contractor on his company, who find the money, and when that fails we are the same as a without its main spring. I also take this opportunity of thanking you sincerely for the assistence you have given, and to one and all I am greatly obliged. I compliment you on your good behaviour during the time you have been is my employ; you have had to work under the most trying circumstances. and have had great difficulties to contend against, as must naturally be expected when dealing with the elements, but I must say you have done your duty like men, and if, by God's will, I am enabled to bring this undertaking to a satiafacitory result, I hope you will do me the honour of dining with me again ; and I must also thank my worthy friend at the emd of the table, Mr. Pinchbeck, for the able assistance he has given me, and rest assured, men, he is your best friend. I must also thank the members of the committee for the great trouble they have taken in choosing these pretty decorations, and for the great skill they have shown in providing the good dinner they have enabled me to put before you; and now, my men, I know you want to get to Portsmouth, so I will not detain you, I wish you all a very merry Christmas, and many happy new years. and I trust that many of them will be spent in my employ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pinchbeck then proposed \"The health of Mr. Seymour,\" in appropriate terms, which was received with tremendous cheering, a salute of guns outside, and the chorus, joined in by all with great gusto, of \"He's a jolly good fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An excellent song having been given by one of the men, the pleasant meeting broke up. A steam launch was in readiness to convey the men to Portsmouth, where the majority go every Saturday.\n",

      "\n",
      "Captain J. W. D. McDonald, retired captain, R.N., has addressed the following letter to the Shipping and Mercantila Gazette :—\" I forward herewith copies of letters, &., referring to works now being carried out in Brading Harbour, and feel assured that, after a careful study of the metier, you will agree with me that it is quite time there should be some understanding as to what department has the power of controlling or preventing injury to the public rights, as involved in the conservancy of harbours, as well as the preservation of foreshores, &c. At present the result of my experience in the matter leads me to believe that the authorities do not quite understaud what power they have, or where it begins and ends. I may possibly be wrong in the conclusion arrived at, but, to my judgment of the case, it seems a matter of surprise that, although I have been (as you will see by the correspondence) in constant communication with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, as well as the Board of Trade, yet the fact remains, that the Brading Harbour Company may do what they like, without any step being taken by the authorities to put a stop to their encroachments. Surely there should be some sort of supervision over works of this nature. There should be a public functionary to visit and report from time to time as to how the works are progressing, and that they do not exceed the powers granted by the original Act. It most at ought not to be left to a private individual to have to keep up a constant attack on the parties who are paid for and invested with the duties of this particular department. If a coastguardsman sees a fisherman or other person take up a piece of plank or spar washed up on the beach, and carry it away, the individual is informed that he has no right to it, but that it must be deposited in the keeping of the coastguard, and he will be eutitled to a certain amount for the salvage. If he objects to leave his piece of plank or spar, and takes it off, he is liable to a fine or term of imprisonment. If the Coastguiud are invested with this power as regard wreckage or drift wood, what is to prevent their having the power to stop any parties removing shingle or sand from the sea-shore? In one case a person can be stopped for taking away a piece of timber, perhaps worth only 5s., and the other may take away thousands of tons of shingle and sand, and there is no authority to stop him from doing so. It is surely time the public should know who are the real guardians of the public rights in navigable waters, as well as those of foreshores, &c. With respect to the granting of powers to a company, as in the case of the Brading Harbour Act, I venture to submit that, in future, notice of any attempt to interfere with tidal waters and navigable channels should be posted up at the Custom-houses and Coastguard Stations within a radius of 30 or 40 miles of the proposed alterations, so that the coasting and seafaring population may know what is proposed; also that the Coastguard officers be instructed to make inquiries as to the feeling of the inhabitants of the district, as well as to receive any remonstrance from pilots or fishermen resident in the district, such reports to be forwarded to the authorities. It is also essential that an inquiry should be instituted by qualified officers into the bearing or effect the alterations would have on Government works and national requirements. These observatious are made with the view of obtaining some certain, sure, and definite means of redress, as well as the prevention of injustice in trampling under foot the public right as involved in the question of conservancy of harbours, free navigation, and foreshores. At present, any inquisitive traveller will find our Coastguard Stations decorated with public notices about the numbering of fishing boats, concealment of wreckage, inducements to enter the Royal Navy, a long list of penalties for the infringment of Board of Trade Regulations, protection of seagulls (with penalties), treatment of the apparently drowned, and others *ad infinitum*. I should much like to see notices in some protecting the rights of the coasting and seafaring as well as the fishing communities.\" Our contemporary, in a leading article, says :\"The 'Piers and Harbours Act' does not, it is generally admitted, confer sufficient power on the Board of Trade, in the public interest, for the prevention of local abuses. Rivers and harbours should be under the control of a Government Department responsible to Parliament. To a certain extent the Board of Trade stands in an intermediary position, but its officers are not armed with the requisite authority for the defence of national rights; for we take it that navigable channels should not be arbitrarily and independently assuaged by any self-imposed body of Commissioners, however honourable they may be.\"\n",

      "BRADING OYSTER FISHERY.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a proof of the value of an oyster fishery when properly managed the award which has just been made in this case will, we imagine, interest not only proprietors, but the oyster-loving public. It appears that the Brading Harbour Improvement Commissioners wished to take an oyster fishery in this harbour which Major Boyle had purchased and worked since 1871. To this, of course, the Major, who has devoted nearly the whole of his time to the cultivation of the oyster at these ponds since he purchased them, objected, unless he received what he considered a fair compensation. This was a matter on which there was a very great difference of opinion, and to decide the point it was agreed to refer it to arbitration. Mr. J. H. Chatton was agreed on as the umpire, with Mr. Gann as his asseoser, the arbitrators being Mr. H. D. Martin Ind Mr. R. C. Driver. Major Boyle had obtained the assistance of Mr. J. Binfield Bird. surveyor, of Cowes, who has for many years practically studied the question of oyster culture, and on whose valuation the case was opened. He had also the valuation of Capt. Johnson, the manager of the Medina and Newtown River Oyster Fishery Company.—The case was opened by Mr. J. W. Fardell, solicitor, of Ryde, who gave an account of the fishery from its commencement, after which Major Boyle was examined. He said that seven years ago he became interested in the Company, and eventually he bought them out, as they had paid no dividend. He then investigated the afiairs, and found that the labourers had never been paid, and that no stock of oysters had been kept on the ground. Eventually they sold the lease to him for £300, and he took it on and began to breed oysters. He bred them every year but one till the last. In 1872 they took out 450,000 oysters, and the average of deaths was about five per cent, during five years. The Major then handed in a statement of what he had purchased in each year. Last year they had had a most wonderful spat ; the wire netting, the cultch, and the bottom of the pond were covered with it. Some of it, casually picked from the pond, was here produced, and it was covered with young oysters about the size of a sixpence. If no notice bad been given him he should have kept on selling and also purchasing brood. —Edward Mursell was then examined by Mr. Fardell. He stated that he had lived on the place all his life and had to do with oysters ever since be was twelve years old. He was now 38; he dredged oysters for his father: he was in the employ of the first manager, Captain Calbach, and then Major Boyle engaged him as foreman. The old system under which he had worked did not do; but he was sure the one Major Boyle had carried out would be a success. He should think there was now about fifteen millions of young oysters in the pond, out of which they could save quite fourteen millions. In the channel all the large oysters were placed, and he should think there were quite 450,000 at the present time. It was an out-and-out growing ground. His wagns was £6O per year. Captain E. Johnson, manager of the Medina River and Newtown River Oyster Fishery, said he had been extensively engaged in the breeding of oysters. He had inspected this Oyster Fishery, and he believed there were over fifteen millions or about 280 to a square foot. He obtained from Major Boyle the number purchased and those sold, and the number stated left 485,000 in all. He believed there were quite 450,000 in the river.—Mr. Wright, on the part of the defendants, opened his case by stating that the Company were not compelled to take the oysters and they declined to do so, they not being marketable. The lease was worth nothing, the clauses being bad, and the spat was worth nothing, and the stock was overdone. He could not admit the amount for goodwill, and for a forced sale too much money was asked.—Mr. Brazier, oyster merchant from Southwick and Brightlingsea, was then called. He said he surveyed the harbour and breeding ponds. There was a large quantity of spat. He selected those he could fish up by the rake: there were only ten on a shell, on an average 250,000 might be put on the hurdles. The total amount of spat he put at 1,850,000, which at 5s. per 1,000 would be £412 10s. No. 2 pond was unfinished. He also examined the ground in the Harbour, which was 200 yards long by 120 wide. The oysters were very thin on the bottom. He took up 100 oysters and he estimated that there could not be more than 200,000, which at 50s. per 1,000 gave £500. He thought there was nothing in the business and no chance of success. Had never heard of a claim for the profit rental; 40 spat could grow on a shell. He valued the spat at £912 10s. The Fishery would never be a profitable one. His value for making ponds and all would be £1,564 5s. He counted a dozen or fourteen on an oyster shell. He was paying 7s. for channel oysters, and he had purchased 11,000 tubs at 2s. per 100. He got for them 9s., and for small channel 6s. 7d. and 8s. per 100; the spat was a splendid one.— Mr. Collard, of the Herne Bay Company, of which he is a director, said he went over the Fishery and he came to the conclusion that the value of the spat channel oysters laid down, construction of ponds, at a compulsory sale was £2,976. He had failed in artificial breeding himself. He had a sea fishery at Southdeep, and the fresh water had come down with snow water, which had killed them. It really was a very heavy spat. The laying ground was clean, and the very best he had ever seen, and he would not part with it on any account. —Cross-examined : He made out the profit, and then the goodwill. There was a market for the spat. He never saw so many oysters and so few clocks[?] on any ground. The valuations were :—For Major Boyle—Captain Johanson, £9,761 10s. ; Mr. J. Binfield Bird, £9,525. For the Company—Mr. Collard, £2,976; Mr. Brazier, £1,564. The umpires' award is £8,000 showing that Mr. J. Bird's valuation is taken as not far off the mark, Mr. Bird, in his report, stating that on or about the 17th of June and the 2nd of July a wonderful fall of spat had appeared, prior to which the pond had been most carefully prepared, and 12,000 parent oysters placed in it: 800 yards of wire netting was arranged, and 800,000 oyster shells placed on the top. Fascines, hurdles, tiles, slates, and clean shingle were also provided, and the result is thet the whole is literally covered with spat, many single oyster-shells having 50 on each, and although from the immense number it is impossible to form a correct idea of the quantity, yet he considedered 15 millions would be a low estimate. Major Boyle may congratulate himself on the success in breeding the oyster, and Mr. Bird on his so successfully and admirably valuing an exceedingly difficult property.\n",

      "English Oyster Breeding.— Mr. Howard Martin, Surveyor to the Brading Harbour Improvement and Railway Company, writes as follows from 145, High-street, Croydon ; — \" In the present condition of the oyster trade and the breeding of oysters in Great Britain it may interest your readers to hear that for the second year in succession a ' fall of spat ' of a very remarkable character has taken place in the oyster-breeding ponds in Brading Harbour, Isle of Wisrht. In one of the ponds, about 3 1/4 acres in extent, the collectors placed to receive the spat throughout the pond are covered with the minute oysters, and an adjoining pond, about 2 acres in area, contains nearly as many in proportion. It is impossible to estimate the number with any accuracy, but there must be many millions in the two ponds. The fall of last year in a third pond (when the fishery was in the hands of Major Boyle, the then lessee) was nearly as large in proportion, as this greater success following it gives ground for the hope that, in places as favourably situated as the Brading Harbour fisheries, the breeding of oysters in enclosed ponds on the English coast will become, in the hands of those who follow right methods, a business with at least no more than that ordinary business risk of failure which every breeder of any kind of live stock must incur. The importance to the food supply of the nation of a solution of the problems involved in breeding oysters in England in enclosed ponds is sufficient, I think, to be my apology for this communication. I shall be pleased to allow any of your readers who take an interest in the matter to see the spat.\"\n",

      "OYSTER BREEDING.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Martin, after a few preliminary explanations, said—The great scarcity and consequent hight price of oysters during the last feew years, has strongly attracted the public notice to the causes of the scarcity, and the the various means by which some of these causes might be remedied. One such cause, no doubt, has been the comparative failure, in many places for several years in succession, of oyster breeding, and there is reason to believe that the deficiency of the natural breeding placesmay be, to a great extent, supplied by artificially enclosed ponds prepared for the purpose, in which the parent oysters may breed, and the \"spat\", or young oysters may be exposed from some of the dangers which prove fatal to them elsewhere. Some authorities on the subject believe the source of supply cannot be calculated upon with certainty in this country, but there are grounds for a more hopeful opinion. No created being probably appears to the unscientific eye more plain and straightforwards and less complicated than an oyster, and probably there is no living thing more a matter of controversy. It is said that whilst oysters have the most extraordinary powers of reproduction— one oyster emitting at one spatting nearly two millions of the embryo oysters— a very high temperature is essential to raise the development of the \"spat,\" and owing to our summers having been, for many successive years, decidedly cooler than the summers of the good old days when oysters were cheap and plentifiul, the annual crop of young oysters has failed us, and will not be resotred until we get once more a succession of old-fashioned summers. The balance of evidence does not appear to me to support so gloomy a view. There is no dount that a combination of favourable conditions is necessary to secure the life and development of oyster spat, and that unusually low temperatures, while it is floating or near the time of its attachment, will probably kill it; but it is by no means proved, on the other hand, that a very high temperature will ensure the life of the spat, or that it may not be emitted and thrive at a very moderate temperature. (After quoting authorities Mr. Martin continued)— It appears, therefore, that our summers are still hot enough for oyster breeding if we can secure other necessary conditions, either by the protection of the parent oysters in the spat in enclosed ponds, or by giving the parents a fair chance of breeding in their natural beds— a chance which, in many cases, has been denied them. There have been many inatances of natural beds having been to greedily dredged to be actually destroyed entirely; and many where the removal, for sale, of oysters of all ages and at all seasons has so diminshed the beds as to render them worthless. It is said, too, that when no \" close time\" was enforced on the public oyster beds, oysters were frequently dredged for sale when about to spat, and emitted their spat in great quantities on the decks of the boats in which they were removed, thus wasting what might have developed into many millions of oysters. It to such causes as these—to short-sighted selfishness which \"kills the goose that lays the golden eggs\" all the world over, and does not rest until it renders extinct every valuable animal on which it to allowed to work its wicked will, that it seems to me, we must look for the causes of the scarcity of the oyster, and not to any unconrrollable alterate in the temperature of our planet or our country, even if such alteration really exists. The breeding places of the oyster are divided into four classes, namely:—(1.) Entirely natural beds, situated generally more or less in the open sea, such as those in the Bristol and British Channels, or in the North Sea, where work to done to protect or assist the reproduction the oysters. (2.) Natural beds, (such as those in the various creeks and bays the coast of Essex and Kent,) where breeding is associated by what is called \"cultivating,.\" i.e. the clearing of the ground from mud, weeds, and the living enemies of the oyster, and the laying down of sheds (or cultch it to called) and other suitable collectors to which the spat can attach itself. (3.) Foreshores on which collectors various kinds are placed to receive spat washed to them by the tides, from natural or partly natural beds in the vicinity, such those at Ré Oléron, Archacon, and other places in France. (4.) Enclosed ponds, in which the parent oysters are placed to spat, and in which the spat is allowed to remain until it is large enough for removal to the ordinary laying grounds, such those at Brading, Cowes, Hayling Island, and elsewhere. As has been remarked before, the supply from the natural and partly natural breeding places has diminished considerably during the last few years, and the use of artificial breeding places has been too recently introduced, and not sufficiently successful, (in this country, at any rate) to affect the supply; but there is good reason to hope that in the future it may come to be a very valuable addition to the natural sources. Oysters are hermaphrodites, and it is now pretty well established by microscopic observations, that they are self-impregnating. Indeed, apart from the evidence of the microscope, the probabilities of the case incline decidedly to that view. Oyster-beds are, in most cases, exposed to the action of the wind and of strong tidal currents ; and it is difficult to believe that spermatozoa could be carried by the action of the water (and they must necessarily be so carried if oysters be not self-impregnating) from one oyster into the other, with sufficient certainty to secure the regular and certain impregnation which undoubtedly occurs. Oysters are said to have been known to spat when between one or two years old, and there is no doubt that they frequently do so between the ages of two and three years. The time of spatting varies, according to the season and situation of the oyster beds, from May to September; but June and July are probably the months in which spatting most usually takes place. After describing the development of the spat, and its preference for certain kinds of \"collectors\", Mr. Martin said he had been unable form any idea as to how long the spat floated in freedom. During the time the spat is floating, great quantities are eaten by shrimps and small fish, and carried by the currents or the action of the wind to places where, finding suitable surfaces to which to attach itself, it perishes, or where its attachment is of no benefit to the owners of the bed from which it started ; sudden and considerable fall of temperature may oftenkill nearly the whole of it while it is floating. When the young oyster is securely anchored, however, its dangers are not all passed. The human preference for oysters, as an article of food, is shared by crabs, starfish, and whelks. In addition to their living enemies oysters are, in some fisheries, frequently killed by sand or mud accumulating above them, or the chilling the water in which they lie by the passage of melted snow over the beds in times of thaw. It is not astonishing, therefore, that the natural productiveness of the oyster—great as it undoubtedly is—is not sufficient to meet the enormous demand made upon it for the supply of the markets, unless in the first instance the reproductive powers of the parents are allowed fair play by the enforcing of proper restrictions on their removal from breeding places, and in the second, great care be bestowed on the protection of the growing oysters when the parents have produced them. Having referred to the fishing grounds Hayling Island, and Brading Harbour, Mr. Martin said that when ponds were first laid out for breeding oysters, it appears to have been almost universally believed that the great essential to success was to obtain \" heat end tranquility\" in the ponds, and jealously close every aperture by which water could escape from them, lest the floating spat should escape with it. The ponds were, in some instances, made shallow to secure the raising of the water in them to higher temperature, and in various ways much trouble and money were expended in endeavouring to secure these supposed necessary conditions of success. But success was not often the result. In some cases the parent oysters spatted prematurely, and the spat never appeared to live at all. In some cases, it lived a short time, but failed to attach itself to the collectors, and success appeared to be the exception rather than the rule. Mr. Martin concluded interesting paper by minutely describing the plan of operations carried on at Brading Harbour from his own observation.\n",

At the last meeting of the Board it was agreed to write a letter to the company, pointing out that the company, by constructing their works, were interfering with the sewage matter which came from the sewage farm at St. Helen's, and claiming as good an outlet for it as they had before the works were constructed.

      "The Chairman said that the company seemed to misapprehend the question. They had previously allowed their sewage to drain into what was virtually a tidal harbour, and the company would convert this into an inland lake or fresh-water stream, into which the Board could not carry the sewage. Perhaps what flowed from the sewage farm could not, strictly speaking, be called sewage ; still there could be no doubt it was highly impregnated with sewage matter. The company said they were prepared to allow them to connect the Board sewers with theirs, but this they could only do provided the outfall was unobjectionable, but they were not told where this was to go to. They might drain into the stream for land drainage, but not for sewage. They must know where their outfall was to be before they could go to the Local Government Board. They had a common law right to drain into the harbour ; that had been turned into fresh water, and as the company had altered it he contended they must put things right.

      "THE BRADING RECLAMATION WORKS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of Estcourt v. The Brading Harbour Company was heard before Mr. Justice Wills, on Friday, without a jury.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was an action to restrain the defendants from maintaining a dam or other obstruction across the river Yar, near Brading, in the Isle of Wight, which the plaintiffs, the Commissioners of Sewers for the Isle of Wight, contended was wrongfully constructed, and was an obstruction to the river Yar, so as to obstruct its natural flow of water from the Sandown level. The defendants denied that the dam was wrongfully constructed, and pleaded that they were justified in erecting tbe said dam owing to the plaintiffs having so altered the flow of the river Yar as to be injurious to their works, and also that the court had no jurisdiction in the matter. The facts of the case are shortly as follows :— The Brading Harbour Company, which was incorporated under a special Act in 1874, had reclaimed a large tract of land at the mouth of the river Yar, which they said was liable to be flooded, owing to the plaintiffs having lowered a sluice in a sea wall which was erected to keep out the sea from certain lands at the mouth of the river. The defendants, to protect themselves against inundation, had erected a dam in the river below the sluice so as to interfere with the flow of the river. And the action was for an injunction to restrain them from so obstructing the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Richard Webster, for the plaintiffs, contended that the defendants had no right to interfere with the natural flow of the river, and that, under section 10 of their private Act, the defendant company shall at all times maintain to the satisfaction of the Commissioners the free discharge of all waters draining into Brading Harbour, and under section 29 that company before commencing any works shall submit them and have them approved by the Commissioners of Sewers, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction in respect of the dam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Graham, for the defendants, called attention to section 41 of the Companies' Act, 1874, which provides that questions touching the companies' works shall be referred to an engineer from the Board of Trade. The Commissioners of Sewers had no right to interfere with private property, and the sluice from time immemorial had been at the same level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Justice Wills.— Your difficulty is section 10. The stream is prima facie within the jurisdiction of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Graham.— They have only jurisdiction if they acquire the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Justice Wills referred to section 39. The following cases were cited for the defendants :— \" Duke of Newcastle v. Clark \"(8 Tamp., p. 612), \" Cross- man v. Bristol and South Wales Railway Company\" (1 Hemming and M., 531), and\" Stacy v. Nelson\" (12 M .and W., 535.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Chester followed on the same side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Justice Wills, in giving judgment, said :— At the time of the passing of the Act of 1874, the Commissioners of Sewers had a right to maintain a sluice that would induce to the better draining of the land. The Act of Parliament seems to take the view that the draining of the upper land should not be interfered with by works on the land below. (The learned Judge then referred to section 10 of the company's private Act 1874.) I see nothing to prevent the Commissioners from exercising what was up to that time their prerogative, to alter works if that would discharge fresh water from their level, and to alter the works at the expense of the company. Section 39 says the Company before commencing any works shall submit such works and have them approved by the Commissioners of Sewers. This interferes with the rights of the company, and the real meaning is that no works interfering with rights of drainage shall be commenced without the Commissioners having the power to veto them. Section 41 says that certain works shall be referred to an engineer from the Board of Trade. This is not such a work. Section 39 refers to one class of works, section 41 refers to another. It is said that there is no jurisdiction to grant this injunction, and that the Commissioners cannot maintain an action for damages, and therefore cannot maintain an action for an injunction. It may be that they cannot maintain an action for damages. The court has power to grant an injunction, I therefore give judgment for the plaintiffs with costs.\n",

      "A HOLIDAY RAMBLE.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the Editor of the Isle cf Wight Observer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir,— When any one who has been absent from a locality for some time returns he notes the slowly-made changes which have taken place during his absence with a keener eye yhan those living near the place, who hardly understand wht time has done. So it was with me. ... From Priory Bay I made my way round by the shore to the St. Helen's point. When I first visited the Island, some 20 years ago, the woods used to stretch luxuriantly at this point right down to the waters' edge ; the force of the sea breakers was stayed by a tremendous reef of rocks. Mr. Smith, on obtaining the estate here, thought it would be a good speculation to use the rocks for building. Unfortunate design ! No sooner were they rooted up than the encroachments of the sea on the now unprotected shore caused a succession of landslips, till, in one or two cases, the fringe of woods on the shore seems to have been washed entirely away, and the shore is almost impassable at some places for the blue slipper, into which the foot sinks. At all events, I am told it cost the imprudent Mr. Smith as many thousands to protect his fast-decreasing property by a sea wall as he gained hundreds by the sale of nature's protectors — the rocks. In my waltc, or rather scramble, on the shore, I noticed that this wall had again been washed down in many places, and some parts evidently during the past winter, for fine pine trees had partially fallen with the slip of the earth, and were drooping their tail tops over the shore, as if lamenting the change. Several were fallen down on the shore, and had been cut off. Altogether it seemed to me at this part of my ramble that the beauty of the shore just beyond Priory Bay had, to a certain extent, departed. A dilapidated wall looks so much worse than a wood gently sloping to the sea. This wall extends right round to the remains of old St. Helen's church, which still stand as a landmark to passing vessels This, too, did not seem to look so nice as in bygone days. There used to be a pretty little wood behind it, full of flowers and wild strawberries. This seems to have partly gone too, and the wall and a fence made it inaccessible. A fence surrounded the old church ground, which was at one time open, and much used by the villagers for tea parties, &c. I suppose this is done because the land was at one time consecrated and no doubt contains many remains of poor mortality. Some of the villagers could remnember when the headstones were there. A walk across the Duver soon brought me in sight of what I had greatly desired to see— Brading Harbour Improvements. The old Duver was just the same as ever ; but looking over the miilpond I could see that a number of houses had sprung up since my last visit. I passed by the Brading Harbour Oyster Fishery Company's beds, and noticed they were not quite denuded of oysters, although a staring notice as to trespassers, and a reward of £5 for information leading to the apprehension of any one taking the oysters, caused me to \" sheer off \". I could not help thinking that the gallant Major who got so large a sum awarded him for the fishery was a very lucky individual. As I passed by the mills, for the first time I had a good view of the much-talked-of harbour improvements, and I must confess to some little disappointment. The work did not look nearly so forward as I had been led to understand, and I believe it will be a long time yet before all the sea is kept out of the harbour and fat kine graze upon the mud flats. Up to the present they have made a railway running down by the side of the harbour nearly as far as the mill, and have heaped up quite a quay nearly opposite. A bank of stones, sand, &c., runs from Bembridge, on the opposite side, and bears some rails, but still there is the deepest anu most difficult part of th© channel to be overcome- before the two lines will meet and passengers conveyed to Bembridge, or the sea be dammed out from the mud flats. There seems to be a considerable amount of work to be done before this is arrived at. St. Helen's Green seems to be gradually awaking to a sennse ot its merits, and the population is increasing at a great rate, to judge by the number of new houses which have sprung up. My walk home was rather a hurrid one in consequence of a wet eveing, but I found time to notice with regret that some one, with hideous taste, had substituted a stone wall for the green hedge that at one time used to encircle the parish church uf St. Helen's, and that the pretty little tollhouse at St John's had been pulled down, to be removed further on I suppose.\n",

The labourers were paid only once a week, on Saturday. The contractor's office was at Bembridge. Most of the labourers lived at St. Helen's. It was the practice for the company to issue tickets to the men for small sums. A sum of money was placed in the hands of witness and he cashed the tickets, which were in his own handwriting. He handed them to the timekeeper, who issued them to the men who required them. On the 21st inst. prisoner came to the canteen with the ticket now produced, and witness handed him 2s for it. Noticed soon after prisoner had left that the ticket was not in due form.— Cecil Raymonf Seymour, timekeeper on the works, living at St. Helen's, explained the issue of the tickets, being deducted from the men's pay at the end of the week. On Wednesday last, when there was 5s due to the prisoner, the witness Pike brought him the ticket in question.He did not issue this ticket to prisoner. Issue of the tickets was a matter of convenience for paying money in advance to save him as timekeeper from carrying about a large amount in silver. The men could purchase anything at the canteen when they received the money for the tickets. Police-constable Goerge, onthe morning of the 22nd inst. apprehended prisoner on the works at St. Helen's, when prisoner said he got a ticket from the timekeeper on the 21st, and the timekeeper, in prisoner's presence, denied it. The Chairman, in dismissing the case, said the magistrates thought that, however convenient the system of tickets for payment of advances, it was a pity the tickets were payable only at the canteen in which the contractor for the work had an interest.\n",

By the Chairman : What do you sell at the canteen, and do the workmen make purchaeas there when they receive their money ?- Witnesss: They sell groceries at the canteen, and the men do not make purchases at the time they are paid, but afterwards return and make purchases.— The Chairman : Has the contractor an interest in the profits of the canteen?-Witness; Yes; the contractor has an interest in what is sold at the canteen.—Cecil Reynolds Seymour said he had been timekeeper at the Brading Harbour Works for about a month, and on every Monday he received 35l. worth of order tickets, and sent the same amount in cash to the last witness at the canteen. Each ticker was for 2s. On Monday last the prisoner came to the office and received an order and another on Tuesday, but he did not give him the order on Wednesday. The ticket produced, which he received from the last witness, was a forged order. After giving the prisoner 4s., there was still 5s. due to him.— The Chairman put the same questions to this witness as he did to the last as to the canteen.— The Chairman, in discharging the prisoner, strongly condemned the way in which the men were paid.\n",

      "John Jacobs v. The Isle of Wight Railway Company. —The plaintiff in this case, who is a working fore-man to the Executors of Col. Hargreaves, coal merchants, at Brading, claimed £50 from the Isle of Wight Railway for injuries sustained by him in consequence of the alleged negligence of the company's servants. Mr. Feltham, solicitor, of Portsmouth, appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, and Mr. John W. Fardell, of Ryde, for the defendants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr, Feltham having briefly opened the case, called The plaintiff, who deposed that he was working foreman in the employ of the Executors of Col. Hargreaves. On the 30th of July last he was on land belonging to defendant company at the quay at Brading. He was expecting three barges in with coal from Southampton. He saw one barge coming to the quay and, thinking that it was for his company, he went to see what it was. It was part of his business to go to the barges as they arrived, examine the coal, and to make arrangements for its discharge. The barges had not arrived, but they came directly afterwards and he was waiting, as he saw them coming up the harbour, till they arrived. At that time there were some trucks upon the harbour works. The works were being carried out by the Brading Harbour Improvement Company and the lines of Isle of Wight RaUway Company were connected by a bridge, but at that time the bridge was not strong enough to bear the weight of an engine, so that the trucks were shunted or pushed on the bridge by an engine, and allowed to run over the bridge and down to the quay. He was with a Mr. Dawes at the time, who as they were standing by the side of the line saw the trucks coming down. Mr. Dawes asked what they should do, and witness said the ouly course open to them was to step on one side, for the trucks were coming with such rapidity that there was no time to run. If they had attempted to run they would have come over them. The width of the siding was about 4ft. There were several skips (iron buckets used to unload gravel) at the side, and the trucks would have cleared witness and the skips too if the clap of the trucks had been properly fastened up. The clap of the fourth truck as well (as several others) was down, and the consequence was that the clap came in collision with the skip, the skip knocked against witness, and knocked him down the quay into the water. Mr. Dawe was standing beside him and they both went over into the water together. The water was out of his depth. He heard no one shout to him to get out of the way, and assuming that they did there was no time for him to do so. He should have been obliged to run a hundred yards to have done so. He therefore thought it best to stop where he was. The trucks were not in charge of any one at the time. The engine sent the trucks over at full speed. They were obliged to go at a tremendous speed to get them up the incline, and they came into the yard with great impetus. He did not know whose duty it was to put up the claps of the trucks of the engine. The accident was caused solely by the claps being down. The blow he received quite disabled him for a long time. He was obliged to go about his work on crutches and have a carriage to take him to and from his home. He could do nothing but direct the other men as to what they were to do and keep the account. Before the accident he was able to do a good day's work as well as any one in the yard, but since he had not been able to carry a sack of coals. He was three months under the doctor's hands. He still suffered great pain. — Cross-examined by Mr. Fardell : I have known the quay about ten years and a half. The jetty ran a considerable way into the sea before these new works were commenctd. The Brading Harbour Improvement Company were constructing works to connect their works with the Isle of Wight Railway, and the trucks which caused this damage were started from the works of the Brading Harbour Company. I do not know whose engine it was started the trucks. I should not have stayed where I was if I could have got away. Many men have stood there before and since. I deny positively that I was warned against going on the works by any one. I did not hear any one call out to warn me. I did not hear the engine whistle. If I did I did not understand it was a warning to get out of the way. When I was knocked into the water a man named Charles Simmonds was very close to me, but he did not try to save me. I struggled to a post as well as I could and begged them to help me out because I felt I was fainting. When I got out a man named Stickley never said, \" If you had listened to me this would never have happened, and I never said \"I am quite aware of that.\" That I swear. I know Mr. Jones, but I am not aware of any conversation in which he said \" You had no business there, and if you had listened to me this would never have happened.\" I never replied \" I know I was wrong. I cold see danger ; but I could not get out of the way.\" There was a break truck but no one with it. There was no one in the trucks. I know the skip struck me first, and that I and Mr. Dawes both went over together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fardell said the question was one of liability, aud he should prove that the engine that pushed the trucks along belonged to the Brading Harbour works.\n",

      "Cross-examination continued : I went to work the next day. I was not expected to work but only to look after the other men. I have not hindered any time, and my master has been kind enough to pay the same wages as I had before. Dr. Bulbeck attended me, and I authorised him to ask for £20 damages on my behalf [A letter was read from Dr. Bulbeck written on behalf of plaintiff.]\n",

      "By Mr. Feltham.— I repeat I did not get any warning from anybody. There was no time for me to effect my escape. The trucks were coming at the rate of 20 miles an hour. Mr. Dawes was nearly drowned. Simmonds handed me a stick and helped me afterwards. The skip was the property of the Isle of Wight Railway Company.\n",

      "Mr. Daniel S. W. Dawe said that he was a chemical manure manufacturer. On the 20th of July last he was in company with the last witness about 11 o'clock. He went to see one of the bargemen on the quay. Before he got there, he saw Jacobs, and they passed the time of day, and witness made the remark that there were some barges coming up the river, and plaintiff replied \" They are very likely ours.\" Witness was then at the lower end of the jetty, on the railway company's premises. While they were standing there he saw some goods trucks move slowly towards St. Helen's. That was in the opposite direction. Soon afterwards he happened to look round and saw the trucks a few yards behind him. Mr. Jacobs said they had better stand where they were as it would be dangerous to run, and that where they were standing was a safe place. It would have been safe if someone had done his duty and placed the claps of the trucks up. Two trucks passed safely, but the next had the clap down and it struck the iron bucket next to Jacobs, and we were both knocked into the water. The skip would not have been struck if the claps had not been down, and the position would have been safe. There was a man standing on the opposite side, but he was not hurt. Heard no one warn Mr. Jacobs. If anyone had done so he must have heard it.—Cross-examined by Mr. Fardell : Did not see anyone in charge of the train, and I do not believe there was anyone. I heard no warning. I picked up Jacobs on the jetty. I did not see Lock. I never heard Lock tell us to get out of the way. I did not hear anyone tell Jacobs not to go on the quay as there were no vessels for him. I have seen the skips on the quay before. I had no conversation with Stickley. I did not take any notice of the whistle. I did not know it was to warn people. They might have been doing it for their own amusement (laughter) . I was hurt, but I have not taken any proceedings because I had no right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Bulbeck, surgeon, but now out of general practice, said he was called on to see the plaintiff. He found that his leg was very much injured, and he was afraid that the bone was too. Plaintiff had a good constitution, and was a teetotaller, but it took nearly three months to heal, and he must have suffered a great deal of pain. He knew him before the accident, and considered him a very strong healthy man. His bill for attending him was five guineas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross-examined by Mr. Fardell. —I was at one time called in whenever Messrs. Hargreaves and Co. required my services. I wrote the letter produced. I asked for £20 for the plaintiff, and I thought that was a very fair compensation. He offered, on behalf of the plaintiff, to accept that sum if it ceuld be arranged between plaintiff and the company without further expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fardell made a lengthy and forcible defence, his three heads being— 1st. That the plaintiff had no right where he was when the accident occurred. 2nd. That the engine and trucks which caused the accident were not at that time under the management of the defendant's company. 3rd. That there was such contributary negligence on the part of the plaintiff as to entirely disentitle him to come there and ask for damages. The Isle of Wight Railway Company, prior to the passing of the Act of Parliament authorising the construction of these improvement works in Brading Harbour, had a quay upon which they landed their goods. It ran into the sea a considerable distance, and it was upon this quay that the accident happened. Then the Brading Harbour Company obtained their Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a railway, as well as reclaiming the harbour. Under the provisions of their Act they thought it best to connect their works with those of the Isle of Wignt Railway, and this jetty was the part where the two works were connected. On the day this accident happened the works were not in a very advanced state, and it was not considered safe to run the engine over the short piece which connected the two. The trucks ran out of the jetty all right, but in bringing them back it was necessary, in order to drive these trucks up the incline to use great momentum by the means of the engine, which did not, however, go over the bridge. The engine, therefore which was employed to give this momentum, was not on defendant's line, and did not belong to the company. The plaintiff had no right to go on the lines of the quay, and he ought to be able to prove that he went there for some lawful purpose. If he had a vessel coming up to the quay, that would have entitled him to have gone down to make the necessary arrangements, but in this case he was distinctly told the vessels had not arrived. With regard to his last point he should prove that the necessary signals, in addition to the warnings, were given to the plaintiff. Notwithstanding this, plaintiff went and placed himself behind the skipp, and the accident occurred. He called  \n",
      "George Lock, labourer, working on the quay at Brading, who said he remembered the day the accident occurred. It was between 10 and 11, that the engine was just going to shove the trucks over. Plaintiff met him, and said, \" Is there any vessel in for us?\" Witness replied, 'No.\" Then Jacobs said to Dawes, \"Now we are here, let's see the works at the end of the jetty.\" That was all that was said, and the witness cleared the jetty of all the people, except Dawes and Jacobs. He saw nothing more of them till they were knocked into the water. Dawes said to plaintiff, before they were got out of the water, \" I knew we were in the wrong place.\" They had no right there, and all the other men were cleared off the jetty. Witness stood on the opposite side when the wagons passed, and there was plenty of room for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross-examined by Mr. Feltham. — There was plenty of room for me, and no wagon touched me. There were several men in the trucks. They had plenty of time to get away safely. We had no goods van. We don't generall put coal on a goods van (laughter).\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Feltham.— How many flaps were down ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Witness. — Ah! you want to know more than I do. We have had several slight accidents. I cautioned plaintiff and Dawes myself, and told them they had better clear off the jetty. Jacobs then asked if there was a vessel in for him, and I said, \" No.\" I am foreman of the jetty.\n",
      "\n",
      "George Stickley, better known as \" Spider,\" in the employ of Mr. Seymour, the contractor, said that on the day the accident happened he come from St. Helen's to Brading Quay. He come there with an engine to shunt trucks. When they saw plaintiff they whistled three times, and witness went the length of that room towards him, and told him he must get out of the way or put up with the consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Feltham cross-examined this witness, but failed to shake his testimony,\n",
      "\n",
      "and His Honour said that if plaintiff was warned off and selected a dangerous spot in which to stand the company were not to blame for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Feltham contended that plaintiff was there on business.\n",
      "\n",
      "His Honour.— But if he was told his barges were not there, he was there as an amateur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Feltham.— We all know how these railway fellows will swear.\n",
      "\n",
      "His Honour. — I am afraid other gentlemen will swear too. These men are the servants of two different parties entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "George Hemmings, the guard in charge of the trucks, corroborated as to the whistle being sounded three or four times, and said that he shouted to Jacobs to get out of the way. The next he saw of them was to see Jacobs' hat flying over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fardell. — It is suggested he went over after his hat (laughter). \n",
      "\n",
      "Witness.— He might if he had any respect for it (laughter). We were a quarter of an hour putting a plate right, so that plaintiff had plenty of time to get away. The trucks might have been going at the rate of 8 or 10 miles an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick Henshall, engine driver, said that on the 30th of July he was driving an engine belonging to the Brading Harbour Company. He brought some trucks to the Beckley corner, and was waiting for the order of the shunter, who was waiting for the signal of the platelayer. When witness got his signal he whistled three times, and then started the engine. He thought they must have heard the whistle ; it could be heard three miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "George Wetherick, goods foreman at Brading Quay, also corroborated.\n",
      "\n",
      "His Honour considered the accident caused entirely by plaintiff's own act. If his business was to go to the quay to his barges he waa told that they were not there. After he was warned he did not attempt to get out of the way ; at least that was the evidence of the witnesses called, and he saw no reason to disbelieve them. On the ground therefore of contributory negligence he gave judgment for the defendants with costs.\n",

      "The Reclamation of Brading Haven.— After many ominous shakes of the head from people residing in the locality of St. Helen's, there can be no doubt that Mr. Seymour has successfully completed the task of keeping back the water from the extensive mud flats which for years have furnished such capital spots for the \" winkler \" aud the fowler. The idea of reclaiming the extensive tract of submerged laud called Brading Haven, originated with Mr. R J. H. Saunders, C.E., who succeeded in forming a company to provide the requisite capital. No trifling amount was required, for already the amount expended has reached the formidable sum of £80, 000. For this investment the company have some 700 acres of land, and although at present this does not look very promising, there can be little doubt that, in a few years time, there will be a good return from it. At the top of the harbour are what are known as the marshes, a tract of low land which has evidently been at some period reclaimed from the sea by an embankment, and this is stated to be one of tho best pieces of grazing land in the Wight. The farmers say that it fattens beasts extremely well, and some consider this is owing to the salt which still remains in the land. There is every hope, therefore, that in a few years' time the land now reclaimed will be equally good. But the reclamation of the harbour was by no means the whole of the company's scheme. They are now constructing a railway to St. Helen's and Bembridge, and a large portion of the embarking work will also serve to carry the railway. Bembridge is at present a locality very little visited, owing to the difficulty and trouble of reaching it. Horses and carriages have had to go a long way round to get to it. and the pedestrian from Ryde could only shorten the route by crossing a ferry at St. Helen's. Nevertheless, Bembridge is one of the prettiest little places in the Island, and very healthy. Already a number of gentry have settled there, and when it is connected with the other parts of the Island by rail, it will probably soon arrive at the dignity of a town, and the company, who have shown so much enterprise, will reap a rich reward.\n",

      "Could old Sir Hugh Middleton re-visit this earth and again cast his eyes over the watery expanse that lays beyond \"ye ancient borough of Bradinge,\" he would find the desire of his heart accomplished. For two years the navvy has been toiling away St. Helens and Bembridge ; and strong and able workmen under the able direction of Mr. Frederick Seymour have devoted their minds and bodies to one object—to reclaim Brading Haven from the sea. On Thursday last that work was accomplished and over eight hundred acres of what will in the course of a few years be probably fine pasture land were reclaimed from the sea. This land will be the property of the Brading Haven Reclamation Company ; and imagine that its value will more than equal the cost the reclamation. We cordially congratulate Mr Frederick Seymour in having brought so arduous an undertaking to successful termination. The name this gentleman will be handed down to posterity as the one who carried out the mightiest engineering work ever done in this island. Not merely has this gentleman reclaimed 80 acres of land, but the inhabitants of Bembridge and St. Helens have been greatly benefitted by his enterprise in other matters; and we hope that he will meet with substantial recompense for the great work he has accomplished. The Isle Wight is larger by over 800 acres than it was when we went to press last week.— *Ryde Newspaper.* [Mr. F. Seymour has many friends in Jersey].\n",

      "bembridge and its Prospects. —Our correspondent writes as follows :— I paid a visit to this little village on Tuesday on the occasion of the annual regatta, and was surprised at the change which a few years had made in the locality. Situated at the extreme eastern end of the Island, and cut off from communication with Ryde by the harbour, it has hitherto been so difficult of access as to be quite out of the way of the general tourist and traveller . All this is being altered, and in a few months Bembridge will be as accessible as any other watering place in the Island. Desirous of examining the effects of the new reclamation works which keep back the water from what used to be \" Brading Harbour,\" I walked from Brading to Bembridge along the old shore. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen's side, just above the Mill, and terminating on the Bembridge aide near the Point. The sea is effectually kept out, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, the \"harbour\" now appears to be a brown and barren waste. As the mud banks have dried they I have cracked, and are covered with large fissures. Thousands of oookles, winkles, and sea weeds have come to a dry death in consequenoe of the reclamation, and their dried shells, which smell rather offensively, can be found by hundreds by scraping the surface of the banks. It will not be many years, however, before smiling green fields will make the inhabitants forget that this extensive tract was once covered with water. Here and there a blade of grass, hardier than its fellows, can already be seen sprouting. The new railway runs from the Brading Station by the side of what was the Harbour to St. Helen's Mill, and will cross to Bembridge on the embankment. I noticed that there was still a good deal of water behind the embankment. This is fresh water, brought down by the River Yar, and flows through large flood gates up to the sea. On entering the village I saw a great change even within the last two years. A speculative gentleman, who had great faith in the place, many years ago built a large hotel and a number ot houses, but, no doubt owing to the difficulty of getting to the place, these remained empty for a number of years. I noticed, however, that all the houses were now let, and that a number of visitors were walking about. With a railway brought close to it, I have not the slightest doubt that before many years are past Bembridge will rival Sandown and Shanklin. The arboreal beauties of the place are most striking. Avenues of trees shelter the roads, and the pathway to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of Shanklin Chine. The beach is as good as that of Sandown, and protected by a reef of rocks. Altogether there seems some justification for the inhabitants waking up to a sense of the long-neglected beauties of the locality, and indulging in the confident hope that their prosperous days are at hand.\n",

      "BEMBRIDGE AND ITS REGATTA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the guide books acknowledge the picturesque beauties of the \"little village of Bembridge,\" they also complain of the difficulty of access to it. There have been hitherto no better means of reaching it from Ryde than taking a carriage or walking along the road to St. Helen's, and then crossing the mouth of the harbour at the ferry. This is so very awkward a route, and so extremely hilly, that Bembridge has remained till within the last year or so one of the most out-of-the-way places in the Island. On paying the place a visit on Tuesday, however, we were astonished at the change which about two years had made in the appearance of the locality. This change was almost entirely due to the new reclamation and railway works, which are still incomplete. Arriving at Brading by train, we took the opportunity of getting from thence to Bembridge by skirting along the shores of what used to be Brading Harbour. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen's side just above the water mill, and terminating on the Bembridge side near the Point. This effectually keeps out the sea, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, Brading \"Harbour\" has now the appearance of a desert. The mud-flats are all dried — at least as far as the surface is concerned, — but, remembering certain awful warnings of people who had sunk into treacherous mud up to their knees, we did not venture far. The banks as they have dried have cracked, and are covered with extensive fissures that do not add to their beauty. It has been a sad time for the winkles, cockles, and sea plants. In some sandy places, on scraping the surface, scores of cockles which had been dried up in their shells were found, while there were numerous winkles and sea weed which had met a like sad fate. Through the centre of the reclaimed banks flows a rather large stream called the Yar. It is a curious fact that there are two streams in the Island which go by this name, and this causes some confusion in the minds of the tourists. The stream has been the principal difficulty in carrying out the work, and an exit had to be provided for it by means of flood gates. In a few years time the appearance of the reclaimed land will be as pleasing as it is now the reverse. Nature soon throws her green mantle over the most desolate-looking spots, if there is plenty of water, and doubtless in a few years the inhabitants, viewing the green meadows here, will almost forget that they were once covered by the sea. Even now in some places a blade or two of grass may be seen shooting up. There is little doubt that centuries ago this harbour consisted of smiling fields, upon which the sea burst, either suddenly or by degrees, till 700 acres were covered. In the interesting account of the unsuccessful reclamation by Sir Hugh Middleton, it is stated that in the centre of the harbour a well was found, proving the truth of our statement. The new railway runs by the side of the harbour as far as the mill, and will then cross the embankment to Bembridge, where a station is in course of erection. On entering the village we were struck with the alteration in the appearance of the place, which seemed waking up to a sense of its own importance. The shops had been enlarged and the once desolate looking hotel was occupied. Bembridge happened to have been visited some 30 years ago by one of those unfortunate individuals who \" live before their time.\" Charmed with the beauty of the place, he thought that nothing more was necessary to attract visitors here than to provide accommodation for them. He built a large hotel, and speculated in building, but empty house property soon showed him that something more than natural beauty was required to induce people to reside here. We noticed, however, that all the houses now appeared full, and unmistakable visitors were walking about. A stroll through the place convinced us that it would not be many years before Bembridge would rival Shanklin and Sandown. It has a beach hardly inferior to the latter, and the approach to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of the celebrated chine of the former. Its arboreal beauty is the chief cha- racteristic of tne village, which nas some of the most lovely avenues we have ever seen. No doubt we saw the village at its best on Tuesday, that being the second day of the regatta.\n",

A company has been formed for the purpose of constructing a railway from the Isle of Wight Railway Company's main line to St Helen's and across the mouth of the harbour to Bembridge. The work is being carried out by Mr Seymour, contractor, and after a number attempts the tide has been completely shut out of the harbour by a thick embankment taken across from St. Helen's to Bembridge, and the land reclaimed is bo used for farming, and building purposes.\n",

The high tides a few days ago made a breach in the embankment, which has been gradually getting larger and larger, and now the sea has resumd its sway over the whole extent of mud flats which had been dry for some months, and vessels actually go up to the quay at Brading again for chalk. The railway which runs by the side of the harbour is also covered at high tide, and on taking a walk over it on Sunday we noticed that the rails were covered with seaweed, and that sand and shingle were banking up round it in some places. The extent of embankment washed away, in spite of every exertion, is said to be over 70 feet. The work of restoration was put in hand immediately after the breach, and the work is being prosecuted most vigorously, but we understand the embankment will take a different course, so as to avoid the heavy sea wbich runs, in here occasionally.\n",

      "We last Monday paid a visit to the reclamation works at Brading Harbour, and found that the damage which had been done there was quite as great as had been reported. There was one part of the embankment, near the Bembridge side, which had to bear the brunt of the heavy sea which rolls in here. The embankment was sound enough, but nothing had been placed on its sides to keep the sand down in its place. The result was that the extraordinary high tide of a fortnight since washed over it, wetted the sand, which flowed away from the embankment like so much water. In a very short time a breach was made, and the sea had such a hold that it was impossible to stop it. The breach has since reached some 70 yards in width, and the sea has covered the whole of the harbour just the same as it did before the embankment was made. Vessels now come up and down the harbour to Brading Quay for chalk as if nothing had ever happened to check them. On walking down the side of the harbour we noticed that in several places the sea had covered the railway, and that the seaweed had washed over the rails, while the sand and shingle had silted up round them. It is, of course, of the utmost importance that the work should be put right, and a number of men are now at work re-making the embankment, which, we believe, will cross the harbour at a different point than it did before. Mr. Seymour has entered into a fresh contract to complete the work, and it is rumoured that his estimate of the cost of the new work required is £10,000. Mr. R. J. H. Saunders, the engineer of the company, writing to a contemporary, thus explains the cause of the accident : \" You will, no doubt, have heard that the extraordinary tide of last Friday night passed over the unfinished work at Bembridge, and within a very few hours a breach was made in the embankment so that the sea now flows again over the land reclaimed in June last. This is, of course, very disappointing, as the work was nearly completed along the whole length, and was everywhere considerably higher than the previous extraordinary tide. There was, therefore, no apprehension or thought of danger, and consequently no precautions were taken. This will, however, be a warning in the future to make assurance doubly sure, and to leave no point undefended. You will be pleased to learn that the work of restoration has already been put in hand. The directors were over the works yesterday with Mr. Grantham, the consulting engineer of the company, when, after very careful consideration of the whole question, it was unhesitatingly decided to prosecute the work vigorously, and an agreement was entered into for carrying it out at once with Mr. F. Seymour, the contractor, and I have every reason to believe I shall within two or three months have the satisfaction of informing you that the sea has been effectually shut out.\"\n",

      "SHANKLIN RIOTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electors of Shanklin are requested to read the undermentioned facts: 1. That on the 17th day of March, a meeting of Mr. Cotton's constituents was held in the Assembly Rooms, in Shanklin, and a large number of Mr. Ashley's supporters attended the meeting and prevented Mr. Cotton and other speakers from being heard, by hooting, yelling, and creating a disturbance throughout the whole of the proceedings ; and it was evident that it was the predetermined intention of Mr. Ashley's supporters to prevent Mr. Cotton having a hearing, and not to treat him with the respect which candidates have a right to expect from their audience on such occasions. 2. That a few nights after the meeting the glass in the house and conservatory of Mr. Coster, a gentleman of Conservative principles, were smashed, that gentleman being absent from the Island at the time. 3. A meeting of Mr. Ashley's supporters was held on the 2nd of April, and at which meeting the supporters of Mr. Cotton from Ventnor, Sandown, St. Helen's, and other places were present, the men from St. Helen's being chiefly of the labouring classes ; they arrived at Shanklin two hours previous to the meeting, in the open day ; this fact was well known to Mr. Ashley's committee, and no communication as to the presence of these men or their attendance at the meeting was made to Mr. Cotton's committee. The men behaved themselves respectably and orderly prior to their going to the meeting, and when in the hall had no weapons, nor appeared to be prepared for a disturbance, but, on the contrary, the sup- porters of Mr. Ashley appeared in the hall armed with bludgeons, short lengths of gas pipe, and other dangerous weapons, and evidently intent upon creating a serious riot. 4. That about 7.30, as Mr. Dampier-Child approached the Institute, he met a crowd of disorderly people, and was struck on the head by a missile. He went to Capt. Harvey's house to warn him that a disturbance was likely to take place. Capt. Harvey, not supposing a disturbance was likely to occur, persuaded Mr. Dampier-Child to accompany him and another gentleman to Mr. Cotton s committee rooms. Just prior to arriving there they were surrounded and attacked by a mob of over 1 00 persons, residents of Shanklin, who threatened to take their lives. Mr. Dampier-Child and the other gentleman were knocked down and kicked senseless whilst ou the ground, and Capt. Harvey escaped from the crowd after being severely handled and receiving some heavy blows. It must be distinctly understood this riot took place before the time fixed for Mr. Ashley's meeting, and that this mob of Mr. Ashley's supporters had some time previously assembled, armed as before mentioned, with the intention ot creating a most serious riot. 5. That, in consequence of this not, many supporters of Mr. Ashley advised Col. Atherley, the Chairman, not to hold a meeting that night, for if he did serious consequences would ensue ; but eventually, about 8.30, the doors were opened, and it is certain that by this time the men from St. Helen's had heard of the riot out of doors, and that one of the gentlemen who had been seriously injured in the riot was oue who was much respected amongst them. 6. That as soon as Col. Atherley appeared interruptions took place, by singing. A gentleman, also much respected by the St. Helen's men, got up in a chair and informed Col. Atherley that if he would withdraw he thought he could obtain a quiet bearing for Mr. Ashley, the gentleman's chair was immediately whipped from under him, and he was thrown on the floor by some of Mr. Ashley's supporters. He got up again to carry his intention, the chair was again whipped from under him; and this time a most dangerous wound was inflicted on his head by some supporter of Mr. Ashley striking him from behind. Hereupon a riot ensued, but how long it continued the committee are not aware. The St. Helen's men were met by several persons leaving Shanklin, about 9 o'clock, in an orderly manner, not offending any one, and, so far as Mr. Cotton's committee can learn, no damage was done to the person or property of any one in Shanklin by Mr. Cotton's supporters; whilst on the other hand, four gentle- men were assaulted aud three of them seriously injured by cowardly attacks from Mr. Ashley's mob, who continued to do injury to property by breaking windows, &c., until after midnight. The Committee offer these facts to the inhabitants of Shanklin and of the Isle of Wight generally, without any comment. H. HARRIS, Chairman, Mr. Cotton's Committee, Shanklin\n",

      "ANSWER TO THE CHARGE OF TORY RUFFIANISM IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT.\n",

      "A True Account oj the late Riot at Shanklin from ihe commencement. It will be remembered that a short time since, Mr. B. T. Cotton held a meeting at Shanklin, and attempted to deliver an address to the electors, but the disturbance in the Hall was so great that he was unable to obtain a hearing, one of the ringleaders of the disturbance being the servant of Col. Atherley. On Friday last, a meeting was announced by the Hon. Evelyn Ashley, to be given at Shanklin, when doubtless bearing in mind the recep- tion given to Mr. Cotton, by the Liberals, some of tne Conservatives, aa private individuals, and not by the instructions of any person, determined to give the would- be Liberal member and the gallant Colonel a similar re- ception to Mr. Cotton's. Thus far the cause of the Tories assembling is shewn, but the pamphlet which has been extensively circulated purporting to have been written by \" One who was there,\" relates nothing of the rioting which took place before the meeting commenced. The electors shall bo shown how the gentle Shanklin Liberals treated gentle- men as they were quietly walking through th 3 streets. Mr. Latimer Saunders, Captain Harvey, and Mr. Dampier Child were walking through the High-street of Shanklin, about an hour before the Liberal meeting commenced, when they were set upon by a party of Liberal roughs and knocked down. Mr. L. Saunders had two teeth knocked out ; Mr. Dampier Child a rib broken, and all three gentlemen were severely bruised all over their bodies. I shall say nothing about the damage committed on Capt. Harvey's house and property, or the serious assault perpetrated on him, as I saw nothing of the matter, but will give you aa account of the meeting. On the doors of the Hall being opened, the front seats were taken by about twenty respectable youag men belonging to Ryde ; these were followed by a number of Shanklin men, all of them having sticks in their hands, with the exception of one, he evideatly;ieader of the Shanklin party, and well known to the Ryde men, haying formerly been employed in Ryde, was armed with a piece of Iron, it having the appearance of having been cut off a gas pipe. After these had been in the Hall a little while, a tremendous cheering was heard outside, and the so-called \" gang of hired ruffians \" made their appearance. Of course a scene of considerable confusion ensued for some time, the Liberals cheering Ashley, and the Conservative giving cheers for Cotton, interspersed with cries of \" Wno sacked the Bobby!''\" After this had continued for some time a message was seat from the platform to Mr. R. Seymour, asking him if he could quiet his men, the reply was sent back that if the Chair- man would allow him to speak from the platform where he could be seen and heard, he would do his best to quiet the men. This very reasonable request was refused. Mr. Seymour then attempted to gain the men's attention by standing on a chair, when before he could address them the chair was pulled from under him, when of course he fell on the floor. (About this time Mr. Ashley and the Chairman left the Hall.) Mr. Seymour no way daunted by his futile effort to gain a hearing, stood upon another chair and again tried to quiet the men, and again the chair was pulled from under him, this time causing him to fall on his head. This was the signal for the rioting inside the Hall to commence, the person who pulled the chair away being levelled by a chair striking him on the head. A tall dark gentleman then sprang from the platform and commenced striking among the navvies right and left. Of course this was not borne with very long, one of them behind rushing to the front and seizing the striker, forced the stick from him and paid him back in his own coin. A general fight now ensued, the navvies being without any weapons but those with which nature had provided tham, breaking un the chairs in the Hall and thereby obtaining some. I think this will do away with the assertion of '\" One who was there,\" that the navvies were armed with bars of iron and bludgeons, for if they had had these weapons there would have been no need for them to have taken the trouble to break up the chairs to arm themselves with. I left the Hall upon seeing the fight that was going on, and joined a crowd of about five hund-ed people who were assembled outside. I had been there about five minutes when the leader of the Shanklin roughs with his bar of iron in his hand appeared on the steps, wildly waving his arms, and shouting \"All Shanklin men inside.\" As no one responded to this call I suppose all the Shanklin men were inside, or else that there were no men in Shanklin. Of course when the navvies came out of the Hall they presented a somewhat different appearance to what they did when they entered it each one being armed with the leg or some portion oi a chair, so I suppose they had left their bars of iron and bludgeons behind them. No doubt they may have had some drink before entering, and also upon leavin- the Hall, but it was in the same way as the writer of this had it, and that was by paying for it from their own pockets; they were perfectly sober. The last I saw of the navvies they were marching on the Sandown-road with a crowd keeping at a respectable distance, pelting them with stones. Of course the heads of the Liberal party will try to make capital out of this affair, but there is not the slightest doubt that if Mr. Seymour had not been assaulted there would have been no riot.\n",

      "RECLAIMING LAND FROM THE SEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Engraving represents a view of the entrance to Brading Haven, Isle of Wight, at low water, and a portion the new embankment recently constructed to reclaim the Haven from the sea. It was until recently a large tract marshy ground, with a bold inlet of the sea, at high water, covering all the low lands between Bembridge and St. Helen’s, about eight to nine hundred acres being overflowed by the sea every tide. Originally this marshy ground was greater extent; but a portion was reclaimed in the reign Edward I. by Sir William Bessel, then warden the island. In 1594 German Richards, Esq., made an acquisition mill, marsh, and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge. In the reign of James I. an attempt on a grand scale was made by Sir Hugh Myddleton to inclose, and recover the haven from the sea; but after an expenditure of £7000 it was discovered that much of the recovered land was a light, running sand; and, finally, after various experiments, the project came to disastrous issue. In April, 1877, the “Brading Haven Reclamation Company accepted a tender of Mr. Frederick Seymour, of Bembridge (who had previously constructed the railway from Brading to St. Helen’s), for the construction of an embankment to reclaim the land contained in the Haven; which arduous work was successfully completed on Feb. 22 last, thus adding 800 acres of valuable land to the Isle of Wight. It is intended to continue the railway on the new embankment (which is one mile in length) from St. Helen’s to Bembridge. As, doubtless, many of our readers know, Bembridge is a village of great beauty, clothed in leaf and shade, nestling at the foot of Bembridge Down. It is an extremely picturesque spot, but, having previously been out of the ordinary track, has attracted but little notice. It is, however, well worthy of a visit, and its many retired nooks afford capital accommodation for picnics. Its sands, too, are firm and smooth, and offer good opportunities for sea-bathing. The view from the summit of Bembridge Down is the finest in the island. To the north the eye looks over the gently swelling grounds of St. Helen’s and sea view to Ryde; and, when glancing over the Solent, with fits majestic ships, commands the harbour of Portsmouth, Hayling Island, and the line of the Hampshire and Sussex coasts, where the slender spire of Chichester Cathedral may be seen pointing heavenwards —while the coast terminates in the blue haze which marks the position of Beaohy Head. To the south is beheld Sandown Bay, with its loamy cliffs alternately rising and sinking, until they tower in the gigantic mass of Dunmore and Shank!in Down. To the west the eye commands a wide view of the inland hills and valleys ; immediately below, the Yar winds its sinuous way through the green pastures of Brading Haven. Now that the land has been reclaimed and the facilities for reaching Bembridge are improved, in all probability this will become one of the favourite watering places in the Isle of Wight.\n",

      "Discovery of a Roman Villa near Brading.\n",
      "\n",
      "An addition has been recently made to the historical attractions of the Isle of Wight by the discovery of Roman Villa at Moreton Farm, near Brading. The remains disclosed have already excited considerable interest among archaeologists, and it has been suggested by some of the Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London that further excavations be undertaken in order to ascertain the extent of the building or buildings, only a portion of which has been yet discovered. The first discovery of the villa is due to Captain Thorpe, of Yarbridge, near Brading, whose acquaintance with the neighbourhood led him to investigations which have proved to be of considerable interest in their connexion with the early history and occupation of the island. Some accounts of these preliminary explorations bave been published. The external walls, at present cleared, measure about 52ft. by 37ft., and enclose about six or seven chambers, with passages, connected, there is reason to believe, with others. In addition to tessellated floors, remains of hypocausts, flues, fresco paintings, roofing tiles, coins, pottery, and other interesting relics, there are the remains of a mosaic pavement, with design upon it of unusual character, and one which is worthy of careful study and attention. The design, though grotesque, is doubtless symbolical, and may be connected either with the mythology of the ancients or the early introduction of Christianity. Its interpretation is not here attempted. Other decorated floors are known to exist the vicinity, and these, when properly examined, may assist in the explanation. The remains evidently cover a large area, much of which under cultivation, but every facility for investigation has been accorded by Lady Oglander, the owner of the land, and Mr. Cooper, the present occupier. Excavations have been accordingly renewed, and are at present under the direction of Mr. John E. Price, F.S.A., and Mr. F. G. Hilton Price, F.G.S. Work was commenced last week, and already a new chamber has been opened up, enclosing an interesting mosaic, the central design of which is a representation of Orpheus playing on the lyre, and surrounded by animals, as usual. The border is an unusually good example of what known as the guilloche pattern. Pottery, glass, and coins have been also found ; among the latter several third brass of the reign of Victorious, a.d. 268. These investigations are important in their relation to the occupation of the island by the Romans. It has been said that the dark hair and brilliant eyes of the veritable natives are due to the Italian colonists. Its annexation to the Imperial power, due to Vespasian, in the first century, and its association in the third century with the fortunes of Carausius and Allectus, are indications of prolonged connection with tho Empire, yet the historians of old are silent as to the rinding of remains. Some, indeed, speak of them unknown. Of late years, however, the contrary ins been amply proved, and it is import tant that all Mich discoveries as the present should be carefully studied and described Inscriptions or other data may yet bo found which may shed considerable light what is already known the history the Isle of Wight during the Roman colonisation.\n",

      "The Haven.— In 1781, Sir Richard Worsley, in his famous History of the Island, considered it, worthy to chronicle the Haven \" us a large tract of marshy ground, containing 856 acres, covered every tide by the sea.\" The recovery of so large a piece of land from the sea had been long an object in contemplation, aud Sir John Oglander had preserved accounts of several undertakings for this purpose. A part of Brading Haven was taken in by Sir William Russell, Lord of Yaverland (Warder of the Isle of Wight, in the reign of Edward I.), at the time when Yarbridge was erected. In the year 1562, another parcel of land was walled in from the sea by Mr George Oglander aud Mr German Richards, when the North-marsh and some adjoining lands qere gained, and in 1594 a third acquisition was made of Mill-marsh and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge by Mr Edward Richards. The next attempt was of a more extensive nature ; a grant ot the Haven was obtained from King James the 1st, by Gibbs, a groom of the bed chamber. The owners of the adjoining lands contested this grant, which the King was very earnest in supporting. After a verdict obtained in the exchequer against the gentlemen of the Island, Gibbs sold his share for £2000 to Sir Bevis Thelwwall, a page of the King's bed chamber, who admitted the famous sir Hugh Miiddletou to a share from the sea. The first taking of it in cost £4000, and £1000 more were expended in building a dwelling house, barn, a watermill, trenching, quick setting, and other necessary works, so that, including the original purchase, the total expenditure amounted to £7000. But after all, the nature of the ground did not answer the expectations of the undertakers, for though that part of it adjoining Brading proved tolerably good, nearly one half of it was found to be a light running sand. Nevertheless as incontestible evidence appeared, by the discovery of a well cased with stone near the middle of the Haven, that it had formerly been good ground Sir Hugh Middleton tried a variety of experiments on the land which had been taken in before he sold his share, sowing it with wheat, barley, oats, cabbage, and finally with rape seed, which last was most successful. But the greatest discouragement was that the sea brought up so much ooze, weeds and sand, which choked up the passage for the discharge of the fresh water. At length, in a wet season, When the inner part of the Haven was full of water, and a high spring tide, the water met under the bank and made a breach. Thus ended this expensive project, and though Sir John Oglander, who lived in the neighbourhood confessed himself a friend to the undertaking, he declared it as his opinion that the scheme could never be resumed to any profitable purpose, and the following estimate in 1699 of the expenses necessary to recover it shews that the enclosing was again in contemplation :\n",
      "\n",
      "May 10th, 1699.— The abstract of an estimate of the charge of taking in, draining, and securing of the Haven of Brading, &c.\n",
      "\n",
      "The damme, or sea wall, will be best to stand near about where the old wall stood, with some difference in the range and variation of the line thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ths wall will contain in length about 3400 feet, and will be cheapest and best done,to consist of the nearest matter at hand, which is a strong stiff clay, with which is to be mingled some other proper material, the delivery, casting, filling, ramming, arming, and sufficiently defending and securing this wall will cost about six shillings per foot running, which amounts to 1020 0 0  \n",
      "There must be two very substantial sluices which will cost the sum of £900 0 0  \n",
      "The charge of utensils of all kinds my amouut to about 250 0 0  \n",
      "The charge of closing and secutely shutting in of ihe old channel, which will be most difficult and troublesome work of the whole undertaking, will come to the sum of 1000 0 0  \n",
      "The profit or recompense to the undertaker, whoever he may be, who shall be found able and successfully to design and execute the work, cannot in justice be less than the sum of 1000 0 0  \n",
      "The total is £4170 0 0  \n",
      "Hy. Sher, Surveyor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We reprint the historian's record of 1781, and refer to the successful reclamation of the Haven in 1881, believing such will be interesting to our readers. We regret we cannot, as we should like to do, record the actual cost, and therefore beg our readers not to conclude the wonderful estimate of Hy. Sher, surveyor, of May 16th, 1699, has covered all. Doubtless the Englishmen had, or will have, before the accounts are totalled, a few extras, which the Dutchmen could not get a certificate for. We however, hope the Brading Harbour Reclamation Company have followed the wise advice of the old surveyor and made some difference in the range and valuation of the line of the wall, from the unfortunate lines of Sir Hugh Middleton and his partner. and that they have mingled with the clay used in their wall some other proper material, and may it prove the estimated profit or recompense of the old surveyor will be far exceeded.— Communicated.\n"
