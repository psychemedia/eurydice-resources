# More Life Aside

We have already seen how devlopments were taking place in Sandown in 1878, such as the opening of the pier, even as the Eurydice lay in Sandown Bay.

As the hulk of the ship was moved into St. Helen's Roads, we also find that the developments were happening there around the same, works that would change the outline of the Island on a map in an even more significant way than the addition of a pier.

## Land Reclamation Around Brading Haven


```{admonition} New Local Steam Service.— - Thursday, September 14th, 1882
:class: note dropdown

[Portsmouth Evening News](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000290/18820914/003/0002), 1882-09-14, p. 2

Owing to the enterprise of some local gentlemen aud others connected with the Bembridge Harbour Works Improvement Company, a new and most attractive steam service has just been successfully added to the attractions of tbe Solent, and one, moreover, which opens up some of the loveliest and least known bits of the scenery of the Isle of Wight. The service is at present worked by a new, comfortable, and rapid little vessel, built in Scotland, and appropriately named the Island Queen. She makes trips daily each way, leaving Bembridge Harbour at haif-past eight, half-past one, and a quarter-past four each day, and calling the Chain Pier, Sea View, the South Parade Pier at East Southsea. the Clarence Esplanade Pier, and Portsmouth Harbour. The charges are exceedingly moderate, return tickets being issued at 9d. and 1s 6d. for respectively second and first-class passages; and as the trip is as novel as it is really enjoyable, the steamer will doubtless become very popular. Yesterday a party consisting of the journalists of Portsmouth, bank managers, and other gentlemen who are interested in the development of the trade and prosperity of Portsmouth and Southsea, went over by invitation of the company and were much struck with the evidence that met their eyes of the enormous sum of money that is now being spent in the improvement of the east end of the island. Leaving out of question the symmetrical pier and other works at and around that beautiful spot, Sea View, we will confine ourselves chiefly to the marvellous transformation which has been wrought at Bembridge the Harbour Works and Improvement Company, under the supervision of Mr. Spencer Balfour, M. P., Mr. Freeman (who, regret to say, breathed his last a few days ago), and Mr. Walker, the very clever resident engineer of the company. Here, where all few months ago was waste of mud and sand and water, are now 700 acres of land reclaimed to the plough, a railway along which runs a well-appointed train to meet the main liae traffic Brading, and which calls at St. Helens en route; an exceedingly commodious and well arranged quay, where most of the cargoes of coal, timber, ami general merchandise for Ryde, Shanklin, Ventnor, and Brading are landed. The works also include the deepening of Bembridge Harbour, and the construction through the reclaimed land of a channel for the river Yar, a stream that drains about a third of the Island. The whole of these great works have been constructed in the most solid and efficient manner and they do infinite credit the engineer, Mr Walter. Close to the pier where the Island Queen lands her passengers, and close also to the new railway station, a commodious and elegantly fitted hotel has been erected and opened under the management Mr. Scadden, whose name as a successful caterer and careful host is so well known in Portsmouth and its neighbouring towns. A golf club has also been formed here, which already numbers fifty members, and no effort will be spared to render Bembridge one of the favourite resorts of the Isle of Wight. An idea of the value of much of the land that has been reclaimed may be formed from the fact that au expert in the employ of the Messrs. Sutton, the well-known seedsmen, estimates that it will require no manure for twenty years. A first crop of oats has just been threshed out with a surprisingly satisfactory result. Some large and well-arranged oyster beds have been established and other portions of the newly-created estate are gigantic beds of such choice vegetables as asparagus and seakale. It will thus be gathered that an exceedingly valuable property is being rapidly created, and people are already beginning to ask themselves how so very promising a field has been permitted to lie fallow for so long, but it seems that an unsuccessful effort to do what has now been accomplished was made two hundred and fifty years ago by Sir Hugh Middleton, who made the New River Waterworks in London. Under his direction a number of Dutch labourers were brought oyer from Holland on the supposition that they would prove to be especially qualified for the work, but they failed, and the failure seems to have deterred others from the undertaking until the successful effort which we now announce. In addition to the railway from Brading to Bembridge a carriage drive 35ft. wide has been constructed between the same points. After viewing the works, which we have attempted thus hastily to describe, and also a pretty acacia avenue for which the place is celebrated, and other points of interest, the party were hospitably entertained by Scadden at the Royal Spithead Hotel, and returned to Portsmouth delighted and impressed by successful effort thus been made to add to theattractiveness of the locality. Full particulars as to the sailing of the Island Queen may be obtained on the Portsmouth side at either of the piers.

[Morning Post](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18980921/013/0002), 1898-09-21, p. 2

The reclamation of land from the sea has always been more or less an enterprise of a difficult character, though it has frequently proved successful. As far back as 1678 the expanse of Brading Harbour, Isle of Wight, was first reclaimed but the sea twice made inroads through the banks. Later an attempt was made by Sir Hugh Myddleton, but again the force of water proved too much for the barrier which was built to check it. About twenty years ago Jabez Balfour secured the estate and built a strong sea wall, formed a harbour constructed a railway, built gas and waterworks, and erected a fine hotel on the sea front. Since that time , about five hundred and twenty acres of land have been gradually brought under a state of cultivation, and this land, together with a building estate of some twenty-eight acres, was sold by auction by Messrs. Douglas Young and Co. yesterday. Over three hundred persons were conveyed by special train and steamer to Bembridge, and the whole of the lots offered were disposed of, the total sale amounting to £13,890, a result which was apparently considered highly satisfactory by the vendors.

The major closure of Brading Haven to form what is now known as Bembridge Harbour was started in 1874 and finally finished, after several abortive attempts, in 1880. After this work was completed the ownership of the Harbour passed into the hands of the local railway company. It passed to the Southern Railway after the First World War and then British Railways following nationalisation. It eventually passed back into private hands in 1968.

In 1864, the Bembridge Railway, Tramway and Pier Act was passed by Parliament, authorising the construction of land-reclamation works and the building of a pier. By 1878 over 800 acres of land were reclaimed, and a pier built. Bembridge Harbour Pier was only 250ft long, and quite narrow too. Despite this, it was used by ships such as the 46 tonnes Tynemouth, and after the harbour had been dredged to allow larger ships, such as the 125ft. Island Queen in 1878 and in 1892 the 104 tonnes, 137ft paddle steamer Princess of Wales, which was re-named the Bembridge. This was run by the Southsea and Ventnor Steamship Company. This later merged with the Southsea, Ventnor, Shanklin and Sandown Steamship Company to become the Bembridge and Seaview Steamship Company in 1912. Ships which called at Bembridge regularly on a passenger service included the Sandringham, Prince, Duke of York, Carrier and the 130ft Lord Kitchener. The largest ferry was the Alexandra in 1913, which was a 235-tonne ship and 171ft long.

" Improvements."

— Anyone who haa visited this part of the Island, and noticed the beautiful sandy beach, the picturesque asa and land views, and the healthy climate, must have felt aome little surprise that it haa not been so well frequented as other places. Its beauties and advantages have at last been discovered, however, and, as with the rest of the Island, things are looking up here. The chief reason whioh has prevented Bembridge from being oftener visited has been the fact of it being rather difficult of access. Although only a short distance from Ryde there is no getting a carriage there, unless one goes round the harbour, which adds several miles to the journey. If a carriage is taken to St. Helen's, it has to be left there, and passengers are ferried over in small boats for 1d. The harbour here is of considerable width, and the channel of some depth, but an unfortunate bar across ita month has prevented it being useful to large vessels, though yachts, barges, &c., find no difficulty in navigating it, and no less than 655 coasting craft, carrying coal, timber, &c., entered the harbour in 1876, and 600 discharged cargoes at Brading. This being the case, the inhabitants naturally wish to preserve the harbour, though desirous, at the same time, of seeing as many improvements carried out as possible. The great improvement is a projected railway, and, while welcoming it on one account as likely to benefit them, they are strongly opposed to the company, who have obtained powers to improve the harbour aas well as make a railway, and they propose a scale of tolls, at which the inhabitants are highly indignant. No vessels could come in without a toll, and all the old rights and privileges of the fishermen will be gone for ever. Although the Act of the company has actually passed, Captain McDonald, R.N., has taken an active part in calling attention to its provisions, and haa written to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Board of Trade, but hitherto without a favourable reply. This gentleman was instrumental in calling a public meeting of the inhabitants last week, when it was clearly shown that the company had trenched conaiderably upon their original plans, and that the harbour would no longer be free if they carried out all that was intended. A committee, consisting of the following gentleman, was appointed to do what they could to preserve the rights of the inhabitants : — Captain McDonald Capt Clayton, Messrs. T. E. Osborn, Searl, W. Osborn, Mursell, Weaver, Damp, and Jones.

Reclamation of Mudlands at Brading Harbour.

Brading Harbour, although a pretty sheet of water at high tide, presents nothing but a vast expanse of mud flats when tbe water is out, and the channel, which runs between them to Brading quay, is very intricate. Nowhere does the water flow over the mud flats more than two or three feet, and nothing is easier tban for a vessel to get aground in making her way up the harbour. The celebrated Hugh Middleton, the engineer who did so much for the water supply of London, as long ago as the 17th century, is said to have conceived the idea of reclaiming these mud flats, and converting them into arable land, but owing to tbe defective engineering appliances of those days, he did net succeed, and old inhabitants of St. Helen's say that wood work aid other relics of his attempt existed till quite recently, A company bas been formed with much the same object in view as Hugh Middleton, with the addition of a railway. They are now actively at work, and have already reclaimed a plot of land at Bembridge, which will be converted into a railway station. An embankment is now being constructed across tbe harbour to shut out the sea, and thus reclaim about 800 acres of land. A large quay will be made at St. Helen's Mill, where goods will be landed and carried by railway to Brading. instead of being taken by boats. The entrance to the harbour will also be improved, so that vessels of larger burden cau enter. A railway is now in course of construction for the conveyance of passengers to Bembridge and St. Helen's. As both these are pretty places, and possess a good beach, there seems every probability that they will, ere long, become watering places of importance.

```{admonition} THE RECLAMATION OF BRADING HAVEN. - Saturday, November 3rd, 1877
:class: note dropdown

[Hampshire Advertiser](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000495/18771103/004/0002), 1877-11-03, p. 1

It may not be uninteresring to many of our Isle of Wight readers, now that the reclamation of Brading Harbour is a work in progress, to know that such a work was attempted so far back as 1616, by Sir Hugh Myddleton, whose successful enterprise in connection with the New River Company has given him enduring fame. Smiles, in his " Lives of Engineers," refers to this work, and says that it is probable " that, at some early period, neither swamp nor lake existed at Brading Haven, but a green and fertile valley, for in the course of tbe works undertaken by Sir Hugh for its recovery from the sea, a well, strongly cased with stone, was discovered near the middle of the Haven, indicating tbe existence of a former settled pppulation on the soil. The sea must, however, have burst in and destroyed the settlement, layiug the whole valley under water. In King James's reign, when the recovering of drowned lands began to receive an unusual degree of attention, the project of reclaiming Brading Haven was again revived; and in the year 1616 a grant was made of the drowned lands to one John Gibb, the King reserving to himself a rental of £20 per annum •• • It appears that Gibb sold his right to one Sir Bevis Thelwall, who at once invited Sir Hugh Myddleton to join him in undertaking the work. • • • A satisfactory arrangement having been made with the King, Myddleton began tne work of reclaiming the Haven in the course of tbe same year (1620). He sent to Holland for Dutch workmen, familiar with such undertakings, and it is obvious that be mainly followed the Dutch method of reclamation, although it would also appear that be also employed some invention of his own. No description is given of the paiticular method a opted by Sir Hugh in forming his embankment, but it would appear that he proceeded by driving piles into the bottom oi the Haven, near Bembridge Point, where it is about the narrowest, and thus formed a strong embankment at its junction with the sea, but, as would appear, without making adequate provision for the egress of the inland waters."

A very curious contemporary manuscript by Sir John Oglander, is still preserved amongst the archives of the Oglander family, who hold a great part of the ueighbounng land, from which it would appear that after the ground was recovered, it was not of much value. The best portion was that nearest Brading ; 200 acres were worth about 6s 8d the acre, and all the rest about 2s 6d the acre (!). Wheat, barley, cabbage, and oats, all failed to grow on it ; but rape succeeded best ; all the others came to nothing. At last, on the 8th of May, 1630, there came a very high spring tide, when the sea made a breach, and, not being attended to soon euougb, got worse and worse, till at last it was all covered again with the sea. The total amount lost in the attempt is said to be about £7000. The manuscript referred to further says that though the country people were much against the reclamation of the harbour, yet it " caused a great deal more health in tbese parts than was ever known before." The gates whioh served for a sluice were dug up some years ago near the boatbouse on St. Helen's, " Duvver."

An ordinary meeting of this Board was held on Monday afternoon, at the Surveyor's Office, High Park, when there were present — Messrs. Stone (chairman), Brook, sen., J. O. Brook, Caws, Moody, Reed, Callaway, Matthews, and Tutte.

The St. Helen's sewage.

The Clerk read a letter, which had been received from the Secretary of the new company which is now making a roadway aud embankment across Brading Harbour. At the last meeting of the Board it was agreed to write a letter to the company, pointing out that the company, by constructing their works, were interfering with the sewage matter which came from the sewage farm at St. Helen's, aud claiming as good an outlet for it as they had before the works were constructed. The company, in reply, repudiated any liability.  
their works affected the Board.

The Chairman said that the company seemed to misapprehend the question. They had previously allowed their sewage to drain into what was virtually a tidal harbour, and the company would convert this into an inland lake or fresh-water stream, into which the Board could not carry the sewage. Perhaps what flowed from the sewage farm could not, strictly speaking, be called sewage ; still there could be no doubt it was highly impregnated with sewage matter. The company said they were prepared to allow them to connect the Board sewers with theirs, but this they could only do provided the outfall was unobjectionable, but they were not told where this was to go to. They might drain into the stream for land drainage, but not for sewage. They must know where their outfall was to be before they could go to the Local Government Board. They had a common law right to drain into the harbour ; that had been turned into fresh water, and as the company had altered it he contended they must put things right. The Board were there first.

It was understood that the Clerk should write another letter on the subject.

```{admonition} A HOLIDAY RAMBLE. - Saturday, April 27th, 1878

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18780427/032/0008), 1878-04-27, p. 8

To the Editor of the Isle cf Wight Observer.

Sir,— When any one who has been absent from a locality for some time returns he notes the slowly-made changes which have taken place during his absence with a keener eye yhan those living near the place, who hardly understand wht time has done. So it was with me. ... From Priory Bay I made my way round by the shore to the St. Helen's point. When I first visited the Island, some 20 years ago, the woods used to stretch luxuriantly at this point right down to the waters' edge ; the force of the sea breakers was stayed by a tremendous reef of rocks. Mr. Smith, on obtaining the estate here, thought it would be a good speculation to use the rocks for building. Unfortunate design ! No sooner were they rooted up than the encroachments of the sea on the now unprotected shore caused a succession of landslips, till, in one or two cases, the fringe of woods on the shore seems to have been washed entirely away, and the shore is almost impassable at some places for the blue slipper, into which the foot sinks. At all events, I am told it cost the imprudent Mr. Smith as many thousands to protect his fast-decreasing property by a sea wall as he gained hundreds by the sale of nature's protectors — the rocks. In my waltc, or rather scramble, on the shore, I noticed that this wall had again been washed down in many places, and some parts evidently during the past winter, for fine pine trees had partially fallen with the slip of the earth, aud were drooping their tail tops over the shore, as if lamenting the change. Several were fallen down on the shore, and had been cut off. Altogether it seemed to me at this part of my ramble that the beauty of the shore just beyond Priory Bay had, to a certain extent, departed. A dilapidated wall looks so much worse than a wood gently sloping to the sea. This wall extends right round to the remains of old St. Helen's church, which still stand as a landmark to passing vessels This, too, did not seem to look so nice as in bygone days. There used to be a pretty little wood behind it, full of flowers and wild strawberries. This seems to have partly gone too, and the wall and a fence made it inaccessible. A fence surrounded the old ohuroh ground, which was at one time open, and much used by the villagers for tea parties, &c. I suppose this is done because the land was at one time consecrated and no doubt contains many remains of poor mortality. Some of the villagers could remnember when the headstones were there. A walk across the Duver soon brought me in sight of what I had greatly desired to see— Brading Harbour Improvements. The old Duver was just the same as ever ; but looking over the miilpond I could see that a number of houses had sprung up since my last visit. I passed by the Brading Harbour Oyster Fishery Company's beds, and noticed they were not quite denuded of oysters, although a staring notice as to trespassers, and a reward of £5 for information leading to the apprehension of any one taking the oysters, caused me to " sheer off ". I could not help thinking that the gallant Major who got so large a sum awarded him for the fishery was a very lucky individual. As I passed by the mills, for the first time I had a good view of the much-talked-of harbour improvements, and I must confess to some little disappointment. The work did not look nearly so forward as I had been led to understand, and I believe it will be a long time yet before all the sea is kept out of the harbour and fat kine graze upon the mud flats. Up to the present they have made a railway running down by the side of the harbour nearly as far as the mill, and have heaped up quite a quay nearly opposite. A bank of stones, sand, &c., runs from Bembridge, on the opposite side, and bears some rails, but still there is the deepest anu most difficult part of th© channel to be overcome- before the two lines will meet and passengers conveyed to Bembridge, or the sea be dammed out from the mud flats. There seems to be a considerable amount of work to be done before this is arrived at. St. Helen's Green seems to be gradually awaking to a sennse ot its merits, and the population is increasing at a great rate, to judge by the number of new houses which have sprung up. My walk home was rather a hurrid one in consequence of a wet eveing, but I found time to notice with regret that some one, with hideous taste, had substituted a stone wall for the green hedge that at one time used to encircle the parish church uf St. Helen's, and that the pretty little tollhouse at St John's had been pulled down, to be removed further on I suppose.

I remain, Sir, yours, &c,

County Bench

SATYRDAY — The county magistrates in attendance were Mr. F. White-Popham (chairman), Mr. J. Coape, Sir Barrington Simeon, Bart., Major-General the Hon. J. G. Somerset Calthorpe, and Sir Graham Hamond Graeme, Bart.

Alleged Attempt to Defraud.— Frederick Cooper, labourer, was charged with uttering a forged order called a sub-ticket, with intend to defraud. —David Pike, canteen keeper, of the Brading Harbour Company, deposed that prisoner was employed on Brading harbour works, and lived at St. Helen's, where the canteen was kept. The labourers were paid only once a week, on Saturday. The contractor's office was at Bembridge. Most of the labourers lived at St. Helen's. It was the practice for the company to issue tickets to the men for small sums. A sum of money was placed in the hands of witness and he cashed the tickets, which were in his own handwriting. He handed them to the timekeeper, who issued them to the men who required them. On the 21st inst. prisoner came to the canteen with the ticket now produced, and witness handed him 2s for it. Noticed soon after prisoner had left that the ticket was not in due form.— Cecil Raymonf Seymour, timekeeper on the works, living at St. Helen's, explained the issue of the tickets, being deducted from the men's pay at the end of the week. On Wednesday last, when there was 5s due to the prisoner, the witness Pike brought him the ticket in question.He did not issue this ticket to prisoner. Issue of the tickets was a matter of convenience for paying money in advance to save him as timekeeper from carrying about a large amount in silver. The men could purchase anything at the canteen when they received the money for the tickets. Police-constable Goerge, onthe morning of the 22nd inst. apprehended prisoner on the works at St. Helen's, when prisoner said he got a ticket from the timekeeper on the 21st, and the timekeeper, in prisoner's presence, denied it. The Chairman, in dismissing the case, said the magistrates thought that, however convenient the system of tickets for payment of advances, it was a pity the tickets were payable only at the canteen in which the contractor for the work had an interest.

New Forest Isle of Wight - Cornish 1903

p12

The reclamation of Brading Haven, and the embanking of the eastern river Yar have somewhat altered the former lines. A map of the island, published in 1610, shows the ancient conditions very clearly. The eastern peninsula is there called the Isle of Bembridge, the western the Isle of Freshzvater ; and twelve years later it was proposed to make the latter into a real island by cutting a trench to the sea at Freshwater Gate, and to fortify it as a refuge and citadel in case of an invasion.

p62
From Brading town to St. Helen's stretched until recently the wide estruary of Brading Haven. Now, with the exception of enough to make a useful harbour at Bembridge, this great estuary, where Sir John Oglander's father would shoot " forty fowl of a night," has been reclaimed by the directors of the " Liberator " Companies.
The nature of the appeal made by this wild scheme in the first instance to the daring speculators who, seventeen years ago, embarked the resources of the company in an enterprise of which not only the practical difficulty, but the financial worthlessness, had already been proved by actual experiment, as early as the reign of James I., will probably remain among the unknown factors of commercial failure. The belief in the possibility of getting "Something for nothing," due to the notion that land won from the sea is a kind of treasure-trove, may have quieted the first misgivings of shareholders. But the fact that Sir Hugh Myddelton, the engineer of the New River, though a " crafty fox and subtle citizen," as Sir Oglander noted, had ultimately failed, not only to maintain his reclamationofBradingHaven,buttomakeit paywhilethedamlasted, was well known in the history of engineering ; and though the mechanical difficulties might be overcome by modern machinery, the nature of the harbour bottom for the growth or non-growth of crops and grasses could hardlyhavechanged. Briefly,thepasthistoryoftheBradingreclamation was as follows. In 1620 Sir Hugh Myddelton dammed the mouth of the river Yar at Bembridge, opposite Spithead, and on the seven hundred acres of land so reclaimed he "tried all experiments in it ; he sowed wheat, barley, oats, cabbage-seed, and last of all rape-seed, which proved best ; but all the others came to nothing." " The nature of the ground, after it was inned," wrote Sir John Oglander, " was not answerable to what was expected, for almost the moiety of it next to the sea was a light, running sand, and of little worth. The inconvenience was in it, that the sea brought so much sand and ooze and seaweed that these choked up the passage for the water to go out, insomuch that I am of opinion that if the sea had not broke in there would have been no current left for the water to go out, so that in time it would have laid to the sea, or else the sea would have drowned the whole country. Therefore, in my opinion, it is not good meddling with a haven so near the main ocean."
This experiment had cost in all /^ 7,000, when the sea broke in ten years later, and Sir Hugh Myddelton's fields once more became harbour- bottom, and cockles and winkles once more grew where his meagre crops of oats and rape had struggled for existence. Some years later an offer was made to repair the dam for ^^4,400, but this fell through. No one thought it worth while to spend the money, though small arms and creeks of the harbour were from time to time banked off and reclaimed by adjacent landowners. The attempt which had baffled Sir Hugh Myddelton was suddenly revived by the Liberator directors seventeen years ago. The sea was banked out, almost on the lines of Sir Hugh Myddelton's dam, a straight channel of double the size necessary for the mere drainage of the higher levels was cut for the passage of the river and the holding of its waters during high-tide, when the sluices are automati- cally closed ; and a railway and quay were added, with a hotel at Bembridge. Solid and costly as their embankment was, the sea broke in, steam-engines and machinery were toppled from the dvkes and buried in the mud, workmen were drowned, and the whole enterprise was within an ace of becoming a little Panama. But at last the sea was beaten, 643 acres of weltering mud were left above water, and the reclamation, such as it is, is probably won for ever. But at what a cost !
thousand pounds are debited to the Brading reclamation, of which vast
Four hundred and twenty sum we may assume that /" 100,000 were expended on the railway quay and buildings, leaving j^' 3 20,000 as the price of 643 acres of sea-bottom.
As reclamation of mud-flats and foreshores has lately been much advocated as a means of providing " work and wages," and of adding to the resources of the country, the present state and probable future of the land won from the sea at Brading is a matter of some interest, omitting all considerations of the original cost. We may concede at once that, from the picturesque point of view, the reclaimed harbour is a great improvement on the ancient mud-flats. It has added to the Isle of Wight what seems a piece of Holland, covered with green pasture and grazing cattle. This area is as much withdrawn from the intrusion of man as the old lagoon ; for as on the mud-flats there were no roads, no rights- of-wav, and no footpaths, so the reclamation is a roadless district, secured absolutely to the use of the occupiers, and incidentally to the wild-fowl which swarm by its shallow pools and drains. The broad embanked river runs straight through the centre, and divides into two the level which lies like a green sea between the ring of surrounding hills and the harbour-bank. In this river, the waters of the ancient reclamations higher up the valley collect during high-water, when the pressure from the sea automatically shuts the sluices, and pour out during low-tide, when the pressure of the sea is removed, through the iron gates, near which lie, with the grooves still sound and sharply cut, parts of the sluices made for Sir Hugh Myddelton of English oak in the year 1621. The general shape of the reclamation is an oval, with one of the smaller ends facing the sea and the other abutting on ancient dams near Brading, two miles higher up the valley. The whole of this has been converted into firm, dry land ; neither is its quality so inferior as Sir Hugh Myddelton judged. Possibly the improvement in the seventeen years during which the old sea-bottom has been exposed to sun and rain, has been pro- portionately more rapid than in the ten in which it was exposed to the air after 1620. Then half the area was described as consisting of " light, running sand of little worth," though the upper portion promised to become valuable pasture. Those advocates of reclamation of land from the sea, who propose to " leave it to Nature " when the sea has once been barred out, can see at Brading and Bembridge what it is exactly that Nature does, and how far art can help to make old sea-bottom into pasture for cattle, and even into a playground for men and women, in seventeen years. It must be remembered that in this case Nature has been hurried, and made to do her work before her time. Left to itself, the harbour would have silted up in the course of centuries, and the pastures would have grown of themselves on land already covered with the alluvial mould. As it is, the sea was swept trom the land, which had to take its chance as it was—mud, sand, shingle, or cockle-beds, just as they came. There was not even an earthworm on the whole six hundred acres to move the soil and help the rain to wash the salt out of it. The wonder is not that the change has taken place so slowly, but that the change from a soil supporting marine vegetable growth to a soil largely covered with grass, clover, and trefoil, has matured so quickly. What was once the head of the bay is now good pasture covered with cattle and letting for 30s. an acre—there are one hundred and fifty acres of this good ground. Nature had already prepared it in part—for it was mud washed from the valley above—and still preserves in contour, though covered with grass, the creeks and " fleets " in which the tide rose and fell. All round the fringes of the flat, where it joins the old shore, the
...
St. Helen's Roads, off St. Helen's Point, and opposite the mouth of the old Brading Haven, now Bembridge Harbour, was once the favourite anchoring ground of the British fleets when about to leave for foreign service ; and their communications with the island were almost as frequent and important as with Portsmouth itself. The fleets used to leave Spithead and anchor off St. Helen's, sending to Bembridge, at the point where a spring of fresh water runs down from the sloping cliff to the sea, to fill their water casks, and to the little village of Bembridge itself for their fresh meat, so long as they remained, which was taken out daily to the ships in " row-barges." Hence the old inn was originally called the " Row-Barge " and the country people, farmers,
;
and village tradesfolk profited greatly by the presence of the fleet. For a time the Isle of Wight held the place for which it seemed naturally suited in those days, of a victualling-ground for the minor needs of the fleet. Sir John Oglander, long before this, had foreseen this possibility, though he did not expect the development which brought the ships to the mouth of the harbour which lay almost in touch with his own park at Nunwell. He proposed that a new port and road should be made at Cowes for a "rendezvous." "If the country would have so much discretion as to make good use of that harbour, as first to have an honest man to be captain there, to build storehouses, to have by a joint store of all provision, and to have that their rendezvous, and to victuall there, they need no other market nor means to make the island happy and fortunate."
The first account of a British fleet lying for a long period off St. Helen's is preserved in the Fleming Collection at Rydal Hall, and gives the list of ships and " order of array " for an expected battle with the French in 1545. Henry VIII. , only two years before his death, drifted into war with both France and Scotland on the burning question of the betrothal of the baby princess, Mary Oueen of Scots, to Edward the Prince of Wales. Henry was at that time in the position of a tenant for life of a large estate, who has exhausted the savings of his ancestors and his own credit. He had only two more vears to live, but
the national, or rather the royal, exchequer was drained. All his father's savings were spent. The whole of the Church property had already been sold in the greatest possible hurry at the lowest possible price. The last financial expedient of debasing the coinage till the proportion of base metal was as four to six, had brought nothing in, and destroyed credit
;
and Henry, in his old age, found himself threatened with a French invasion, and without means to equip a sufficient fleet.

CHARGE OF UTTERING A FORGED ORDER- Frederick Cooper, navvy, St. Helen's, was charged with uttering a forged order.— Daniel Pyke said he was canteen-keeper at the Brading Harbour Improvement Works, at which the prisoner was employed. At the work they made use of order tickets, each ticket being for 2s. The men were paid by on Saturday, but during the week any workman by going to the timekeeper could get a ticket or tickets, which they brought to him at the canteen, and he gave them money for it. On Wednesday last the prisoner brought him the ticket produced, for which he gave him 2s., but after he left he noticed it was a forged ticket, which he gave over to the time-keeper. By the Chairman : What do you sell at the canteen, and do the workmen make purchaeas there when they receive their money ?- Witnesss: They sell groceries at the canteen, and the men do not make purchases at the time they are paid, but afterwards return and make purchases.— The Chairman : Has the contractor an interest in the profits of the canteen?-Witness; Yes; the contractor has an interest in what is sold at the canteen.—Cecil Reynolds Seymour said he had been timekeeper at the Brading Harbour Works for about a month, and on every Monday he received 35l. worth of order tickets, and sent the same amount in cash to the last witness at the canteen. Each ticker was for 2s. On Monday last the prisoner came to the office and received an order and another on Tuesday, but he did not give him the order on Wednesday. The ticket produced, which he received from the last witness, was a forged order. After giving the prisoner 4s., there was still 5s. due to him.— The Chairman put the same questions to this witness as he did to the last as to the canteen.— The Chairman, in discharging the prisoner, strongly condemned the way in which the men were paid.

Brading Haven Reclamation Scheme.

— During the few years the works in connection with the above scheme have been in progress, there have not been wanting those ready to express a doubt as to Mr. Seymour or anyone else having the power of bringing such a work to a successful termination. In the annals of engineering, however, there is no such word as " fail," and when we look at the vast works carried out by men like Lesseps, Stephenson, Brunei], and many others, there is no need for doubt as to the ultimate success of the reclamation of Brading harbour. The idea of reclaiming the extensive mudflats, which for years hare only been haunted by the " winkle picker," originated with Mr. E J. H. Saunders, C.E., who succeeded in forming a company to provide the requisite capital, and this company included in its programme not merely the reclamation of the harbour, but the construction of a railway to the pretty little village of Bembridge, hitherto cut off from free communication with other parts of the Island. That the capital required was no trifle may be gathered from the fact that already £80,000 have been expnnded, but no doubt in a few years the company will find the seven hundred acres of land they have now succeeded in preventing the sea from covering very remunerative. At the head of the harbour is a tract of marshy land which at one time was evidently submerged and reclaimed by means of an embankment. This is said to be one of the best bits of grazing gronnd in the Island ; the salt which still remains in tbe gronnd exactly suits the cattle, who thrive on it extremely well, and we see no reason why the land now reclaimed should not be in a few years equally suitable for grazing purposes. The railway to Bembridge also will open up one of the most lovely, though hitherto neglected, spots in the Island. A few years will probably convert this little village into a town, and then the company who have displayed so muoh enternrise will receive a fitting reward.

—Between the Bembridge and St. Helen's Cliffs, at the Isle Wight, the sea entered and formed a lake known Brading Harbour, covering area of about 900 acres. A company has been formed for the purpose of constructing a railway from the Isle of Wight Railway Company's main line to St Helen's and across the mouth of the harbour to Bembridge. The work is being carried out by Mr Seymour, contractor, and after a number attempts the tide has been completely shut out of the harbour by a thick embankment taken across from St. Helen's to Bembridge, and the land reclaimed is bo used for farming, and building purposes.

The Reclamation Works.—

We last Monday paid a visit to the reclamation works at Brading Harbour, and found that the damage which had been done there was quite as great as had been reported. There was one part of the embankment, near the Bembridge side, which had to bear the brunt of the heavy sea which rolls in here. The embankment was sound enough, but nothing had been placed on its sides to keep the sand down in its place. The result was that the extraordinary high tide of a fortnight since washed over it, wetted the sand, which flowed away from the embankment like so much water. In a very short time a breach was made, and the sea had such a hold that it was impossible to stop it. The breach has since reached some 70 yards in width, and the sea has covered the whole of the harbour just the same as it did before the embankment was made. Vessels now come up and down the harbour to Brading Quay for chalk as if nothing had ever happened to check them. On walking down the side of the harbour we noticed that in several places the sea had covered the railway, and that the seaweed had washed over the rails, while the sand and shingle had silted up round them. It is, of course, of the utmost importance that the work should be put right, and a number of men are now at work re-making the embankment, which, we believe, will cross the harbour at a different point than it did before. Mr. Seymour has entered into a fresh contract to complete the work, and it is rumoured that his estimate of the cost of the new work required is £10,000. Mr. R. J. H. Saunders, the engineer of the company, writing to a contemporary, thus explains the cause of the accident : " You will, no doubt, have heard that the extraordinary tide of last Friday night passed over the unfinished work at Bembridge, and within a very few hours a breach was made in the embankment so that the sea now flows again over the land reclaimed in June last. This is, of course, very disappointing, as the work was nearly completed along the whole length, and was everywhere considerably higher than the previous extraordinary tide. There was, therefore, no apprehension or thought of danger, and consequently no precautions were taken. This will, however, be a warning in the future to make assurance doubly sure, and to leave no point undefended. You will be pleased to learn that the work of restoration has already been put in hand. The directors were over the works yesterday with Mr. Grantham, the consulting engineer of the company, when, after very careful consideration of the whole question, it was unhesitatingly decided to prosecute the work vigorously, and an agreement was entered into for carrying it out at once with Mr. F. Seymour, the contractor, and I have every reason to believe I shall within two or three months have the satisfaction of informing you that the sea has been effectually shut out."

> A Short History of The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club
> Published by the club, circa 1922 - with some small changes for ease of reading. This account is of the early days of the club and formed the main part of a pamphlet which set out its history.
>
> The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club can be said to have originated at a luncheon party held at the Royal Spithead Hotel in the spring of 1882, when to the assembled company that popular sportsman, Captain Jack Eaton R.N. suddenly proposed: "What was the Duver meant for?"
>
> The party hazarded various suggestions, but Jack Easton would accept none of them crying out himself “It was made on purpose for golf". So across the harbour the party went and had explained to them the intricacies of a game which was at that time unknown in England, save to a few enthusiasts who played at Blackheath, Wimbledon and Westward Ho!
>
> Jack Eaton’s enthusiasm quickly spread to his hearers, and almost before the tour of the Duver was over, they had promised one and all to become members of the new club, which it was decided to call the Isle of Wight Golf Club.
>
> A man of action, this commander of the eastern division of the Isle of Wight Coastguards very soon obtained a lease of the ground from the Brading Harbour Company, and it was not long after the date of the luncheon party that men were set to work under the supervision of experts “with strong Gaelic dialects“ to root up and cut down the gorse bushes, level the ground and transport freshly cut turf from the downs to the projected greens.
> Naturally, the interest of the islanders was evoked in this new and wonderful game, and the preparations being made for the playing of it. Speculation as to the nature of the game ran high, some thinking it would be a sort of new kind of croquet, others that it would reveal itself as a form of dignified hockey with a touch of polo on foot. Both conceptions were about as far from the truth as that of an engineer of a steam yacht at that time in the harbour who "knowed it was worked somehow by steam, ‘cos he heard ‘em a talking’ about the best drive, and where the bunkers were to be."
>
> The list of members slowly but steadily increased, and no inconsiderable gathering of people was present at the opening ceremony. The honour of driving the first ball fell to a Mrs Hambrough, wife of the club’s first captain, Dudley A. Hambrough, and she acquitted herself well in what must have been something of a trying ordeal. In strict truthfulness it must be recorded that at the first match the interest of many spectators was directed not so much at the players as at one of the caddies , who was a very pretty barmaid from the Royal Spithead Hotel.

This club, which has been estalished in connection with the Royal Spithead Hotel here, held its first autumn meeting on Thursday. Unfortunately the weather was totally against good scoring. Eight couples started to compete for the prizes, consisting of a gold medal, presented by Mr C.

On examining the cards it was found there was a tie between Captain Corse Scott and Mr R. B. Molesworth at 95 strokes for the Tottenham gold medal, and, on playing off the tie, Mr Molesworth won, doing the round in 88 strokes. Captain C. Scott, with a gross score of 95, reduced by an allowance of 8 to 87, carried off Mrs H. Grose Smith's much coveted prize. The set of clubs was won by Captain Eaton, R.N., with a score of 99 reduced by an allowance of 2 to 97, and the prize of golf balls was won by Mr A. J. Duncan, with a score of 111, reduced by an allowance of 26 to 115, The scores were :

To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.
Sir, — I observe in your issue of last Saturday, in reference to the Isle of Wight Golf Club, that it is stated that the club is in connection with the Royal Spithead Hotel, Bembridge. As this is in no way the case, I shall be much obliged by your correcting the statement in your next issue. The Golf Club merely holds its dinners, &c, there, and of course it is the natural place for members from a distance to stay at when visiting the Island for golf. Yours faithfully, J. P. EATON, Hon. Sec. November 6th, 1882.

```{admonition} RULES FOR THE GAME OF GOLF, 1886

http://ruleshistory.com/rules1886.html

12 MARCH 1886.
RULES FOR THE GAME OF GOLF
THE ROYAL ISLE OF WIGHT GOLF CLUB

[Commentary: An early attempt at a universal rules code ("...shall suit all greens alike.") from the now defunct Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club.
A remarkable document; well laid out, well written and more comprehensive than any other code of the time.
This code introduced definitions, out of bounds, hole size (albeit at 4 inches) and other concepts later incorporated in the R&A codes.]

https://www.islandeye.co.uk/history/historic-parks/the-royal-isle-of-wight-golf-club.html
The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club can be said to have originated at a luncheon party held at the Royal Spithead Hotel in the spring of 1882, when to the assembled company that popular sportsman, Captain Jack Eaton R.N. suddenly proposed: “What was the Duver meant for?”
The party hazarded various suggestions, but Jack Easton would accept none of them crying out himself “It was made on purpose for golf". So across the harbour the party went and had explained to them the intricacies of a game which was at that time unknown in England, save to a few enthusiasts who played at Blackheath, Wimbledon and Westward Ho!
Jack Eaton’s enthusiasm quickly spread to his hearers, and almost before the tour of the Duver was over, they had promised one and all to become members of the new club, which it was decided to call the Isle of Wight Golf Club.
A man of action, this commander of the eastern division of the Isle of Wight Coastguards very soon obtained a lease of the ground from the Brading Harbour Company, and it was not long after the date of the luncheon party that men were set to work under the supervision of experts “with strong Gaelic dialects“ to root up and cut down the gorse bushes, level the ground and transport freshly cut turf from the downs to the projected greens.
Naturally, the interest of the islanders was evoked in this new and wonderful game, and the preparations being made for the playing of it. Speculation as to the nature of the game ran high, some thinking it would be a sort of new kind of croquet, others that it would reveal itself as a form of dignified hockey with a touch of polo on foot. Both conceptions were about as far from the truth as that of an engineer of a steam yacht at that time in the harbour who “knowed it was worked somehow by steam, ‘cos he heard ‘em a talking’ about the best drive, and where the bunkers were to be.”
The list of members slowly but steadily increased, and no inconsiderable gathering of people was present at the opening ceremony. The honour of driving the first ball fell to a Mrs Hambrough, wife of the club’s first captain, Dudley A. Hambrough, and she acquitted herself well in what must have been something of a trying ordeal. In strict truthfulness it must be recorded that at the first match the interest of many spectators was directed not so much at the players as at one of the caddies , who was a very pretty barmaid from the Royal Spithead Hotel.
These were but interludes in the development of the club, which each month added to its membership and on September 18th 1883 a letter was received from the Secretary of State intimating he had “had the honour to submit to the Queen you (the Secretary’s) request that the Isle of Wight Golf Club may be permitted to assume the title of ‘Royal ‘and that Her Majesty has been graciously please to accede to your request and to command that the Club be styled the ‘Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club’.”
With the bestowal of this royal patronage, the reputation of the club was still further enhanced and so many more members enrolled, that a special private room at the hotel had to be reserved for their special use. It may be remarked that this patronage has been extended by the royal family until the present day. The late King Edward was patron of the club until his death and our present King has been patron since his ascension in 1910. H.R.H. Prince Henry of Battenburg was captain for the years 1894-1895, and his two sons, Prince Leopold and Prince Maurice, are both Hon. Members at the present time.
The yearly crowdings at the two hotels resulted in the roof of the Royal Spithead Hotel being raised and another storey added, and this accommodation was further supplemented by a new private room which was built at a later date for the club members.
The plan shows how well and naturally the holes are laid out, giving a good length (2891 yards) width, and variety of holes, on such a relatively small area of ground. In fact it is doubtful if there is to be found anywhere, nine more attractive and varied holes in such a small compass; and yet despite its size, it will be found in playing (with a bogey of 37) to be a most enjoyable and difficult test of golf.
The natural hazards are sand dunes and hillocks, gorse, sea boundaries, and a public road, which round diagonally across the links, coming into prominence at 4 holes 1, 5, 6 and 9, and in a minor ways at the 8th, off a poorly played shot.
The three long holes, 1st, 8th and 9th are good three shot ones, in anything but calm, dry weather! The 3rd and 4th and 6th are superlative “fours” and would be hard to beat by comparison anywhere. The 2nd, 5th and 7th are very good and varied one shot holes, and of different length and difficulty and the 7th being a particularly clever punchbowl shot. Altogether the course is one of the most interesting nine hole in existence, and is full of character and individuality throughout, with the possible exception of the 5th, which is perhaps rather insipid and weak, but necessary, to keep up the proper sequence of play. This hole however together with the 6th are the only two remaining holes of the original course, as laid in 1892. That is to say they have been in constant play with little alterations for 47 years. 
The links and clubhouse are situated on The Duver, St Helens, Isle of Wight, 4 minutes by ferry boat to Bembridge Station, Southern Railway, 10 minutes to St Helen’s Station via the Mill Pond Walk and Harbour Yards; 20 minutes by a good “bus service to Ryde and Sea View from St Helen’s Village.
https://www.islandeye.co.uk/history/historic-parks/royal-isle-of-wight-ladies-golf-course-and-pavillion.html
The ladies course had 18 short holes with natural bunkers. The pavillion acted as the clubhouse as well. Gentlemen were allowed to play the course, so long as they were accompanied by a lady.

The Spithead Hotel opened in 1882. In the same year the railway was extended to Bembridge, (the station was on the opposite side of the road) and with a new pier for steamers, the hotel was well positioned for visitors.q
Royal patronage was granted to the hotel in the following year, 1883
The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club, on the sand dunes across the harbour, was established by visitors to the hotel, the hotel was also popular with visitors to nearby Bembridge Sailing Club.
The hotel was demolished in 1989 and the site redeveloped.

## The Temperance Debate Continues


```{admonition} CLOSING PUBLIC-HOUSES ON SUNDAY. - Thursday, July 10th, 1879
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Times](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002100/18790710/110/0005), 1879-07-10, p. 5

The Mayor said that the next matter on the agenda was a motion by himself and he hoped that they would all give their adhesion to it. That butchers, bakers, grocers, tailors, and candlestick makers, should not be allowed to sell on Sundays, and that publicans should be allowed to sell intoxicating liquors on Sundays had always been a marvel to him. A large number of publicans would only be too glad to close their hones if they could. He thought that as the Governing body of the town they ought to shew their respect for the Sabbath-day by trying to close public-houses. When they considered the number of people that public-houses kept at work on the Sabbath he thought they would see that there was good reason why such houses should be shut up. He proposed the following resolution:—" That the seal of the Borough be of to a petition to Parliament for closing Public-houses on Sundays."

Councillor PURNIILL seconded the resolution.

Alderman Wallis said he could not support the resolution, on the ground that it was an Imperial measure and had nothing whatever to do with Corporation matters. It was bringing a party question before the Council. Suppose for instance that Councils were to take up the abolition of flogging in the army, it would be said at once that the Conservatives were trying to carry and the Liberals to stop it. If the matter were brought before the town of Ryde it would wear a different aspect. He did not mean to say that the petition came from the Mayor.

The MAYOR said he should be very proud of it if it had.

Councillor Spenser said he should record his vote against the resolution for the reasons advanced by Alderman Wallis. He thought it would be a great pity for the Council to deal in party politics. He did not think that public-houses should be shut on Sundays, but publicans had a right to shut the shops up if liked. (The Mayor said they were obliged to open at certain hours.) It was at their option to apply for a licence to enable them to do so. It was all very well for gentlemen, like the Mayor, who might have their cask of ale and wine cellar, but the poor man could not do that. The Mayor had said that public-houses being open on the Sunday was a nuisance. (The Mayor replied that he used no such word.) Councillor Spencer replied if the Mayor did not use that word he led them to suppose that they were so. Of course the Mayor knew that his motion would be opposed. It must eventually become a question of party politics— (The Mayor :—" No, Never.")— It must eventually become a measure of that sort and he did not think that it should be introduced there.

Councillor Purnell remarked that the question was one which lay at their own doors and was really a town question. For public-houses to be open on the Sabbath was a great nuisance. He questioned whether it was the poor man who most used the public-house, on the Sunday, or whether it was the middle class. He thought that it was the beet movement that the Mayor had brought forward since he bad known him, and he would support it with both hands and stand up three times to do so.

Councillor James thought that he might stand between the two parties at that Council, for was he not prejudiced against the publicans, nor yet a total abstainer. He could not vote for the resolution because he did not think that it ought to be brought forward there. He had thought this matter over, and they bad to remember that there were thousands who could only come out of the large towns on the Sunday, and it would be a certain amount of hardship on them if the houses were all closed. He would say that the members of that Council ought to set an example. He was not going to sign any petition for they were living in a free country. He stayed away from public. houses, but he did not say to his neighbours they should not go. He admitted that there were too many licensed houses in the town, but at the same time the magistrates had not taken away a single license from the place. The Mayor had not done so aver since he had been Chief Magistrate. He understood that the power to do so was in the magistrates' hands, and to take away new licenses.

The MAYOR : Unfortunately it is not, and not one of the old ones unless it is endorsed.

Councillor Newbald said it would scarcely be right to close public-houses and to leave hotels open.

Alderman Colenutt said that he could not understand how this could be looked upon as a question of Imperial policy, nor yet how it arose. If they wanted to get into a squabble between Tories and Reformers, then they could try it as question of policy, or as a question of Parsons and publicans, or so on (Laughter). [Alderman FUTCHER : That is the very thing the question arises out of.] It was a question which affected the social condition of the people, and that was to a certain extent entrusted to the care of the Municipal Authorities. If power were given to the Municipal Authorities, over the individual, to regulate moral conduct, and to deal with drunkenness, it was quite legitimate for the Town Council to deal with the question they had before them, and to regulate the vendors of the article which produced such mischief in the country. Intoxicating drinks terribly affected the best interests of their country'. He had had to do with workingmen, and in almost every case where they found mothers and their families not properly cared for, or in a state of distress, it was through the husband improperly using intoxicating drinks. There was the the greater temptation to men to use those drinks on the Sunday. There was an old saying that "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do," and they found the working-man often waiting on the Sunday for the public-houses to open. Who were the parties who suffered the most? Why the poor women and their children, who would not suffer so much if those houses were not open on the Sunday. It appeared to him, therefore, that this was a social question and if they could cause a reformation and induce people to drink lees it would produce a social benefit. He thought that they should ask Parliament to enact such laws as would lessen crime, and the degradation and expense, which that crime was sure to bring on to their country. He could not for a moment suppose that it was a question of Imperial politics, and he could only believe that his friend on the right had raised that point only to frighten them. Parliament had entrusted them with power over many matters, which affected them in their moral relations, and their social relations with one another, and therefore he thought that they should deal with the question as a means to prevent the commission of crime.

Alderman HARRINGTON remarked that drunkenness was such a prevalent crime and was of such blighting consequences and so affecting the prospects of their country that he was afraid that it was leading them below the position which they ought to occupy. That the question before them was an Imperial question he fully admitted, and the making of it a matter of party polities was one great cause why the Liberals lost their seats. They shortened the publican's hours by an hour, and the feeling was so great, that he knew thousands, well he said thousands (nationally) but he knew several (locally), who voted against them on that account.

Alderman Colenutt spoke about intoxicating drink being a luxury, and there was no doubt that it was a luxury, for there was not the slightest nourishment in it. If gentlemen with means could afford to indulge in luxuries, he did not know that they could say much against them. Setting that aside, under the unfortunate public-house system the poor man went and spent that which would support his wife and family and by so doing brougut them to degradation. No man was worthy of the name of a man who neglected his wife and children, in order to indulge in a degrading luxury. That it tended to party politics to a very considerable extent there was no doubt whatever. It was a social, a personal, a domestic, and a religious question. If a man got drunk it was a personal question, for if it were in his own house, in the bosom of his own family, the law could not touch him. It was then a social question, but the law could touch him if he got drunk and went into the public road, for he then become a nuisance. The only influence that could be brought to bear, to stop the use of intoxicating drink, and the sad things resulting from it, was the religious influence. To shew men that they were going against the laws of God. If it were found in other countries, that religion prevented drunkenness, why should it not there? The Clergy and Ministers of England were to blame for the crime that existed.—(Councillor Purnell "Question.")—Look ut the Jews, they confined themselves to certain sorts of meat because their religion taught them to do it. The Mahomedans abstained from intoxicating drink because their religion kept them from it. He did not see why the Christian religion, which was far superior to all others, should not produce a similar influence. This was the only way to stop this evil. In Scotland, where public-houses were kept closed, on Sundays, men would sit at home and drink whiskey "toddy" till they could not move. Scotland was one of the most drunken countries in the world. (Voices, "No ! No ! No ! " " Hear, Hear ".) He was afraid that the resolution would lead to a great deal of sly drunkenness. It was such a burning question throughout the country that he should support the cause. He should like very much to see the licensing power transferred from the magistrates to local governing, bodies like the Council; not only fur renewing licenses, but to stop them and to have full control over intoxicating drink. Refer it to the Watch Committee, and let them give instructions to the police; the committee to have power to appoint persons annually. It was very serious that there should be 143,000,000 of money spent yearly in drink, and must very seriously injure their country. There was a Committee formed in the House of Commons on the present agricultural depression, (laughter). They might laugh if they liked, but it was a very serious matter and from drink and a variety of circumstances they were rather a descending nation. It was said that this was a free country. Yes ; and everybody was free to go to the Devil their own way, if they liked, (laughter).

Councillor RIDDETT thought they were now wasting their time in discussing such a question as a whole.

Alderman Colenutt replied that no question effecting the interest of people was a waste of time.

Councillor Riddett said when marriage with the deceased wife's sister was brought up he protested against it and he protested against the present subject as being one equally beyond the province of the Council. If they were to introduce social questions of that kind they would bo going dreadfully beyond their province. He had a good deal of sympathy with the movement and he wished to decrease the intemprance of the country and to secure to all classes the Sabbath Day as a day of rest, but he was not prepared to vote for a resolution, which he considered very wide indeed, and which would imply a great deal that they ought not to carry without further interest being considered outside those of public-houses. It was not because ho did not agree with the principle of the resolution.

Alderman DASHWOOD remarked that if anybody could shew or attempt to show, that the evil arising from intemperance were not greater than all others put together then there would be a reason for asking him not to support the resolution, but one gentleman said " my sympathies go one way, but my votes must go another," and yet he had not told them why. It was quite reasonable they should. For he had no doubt that gentlemen who considered it an Imperial question understood the reason very well why certain parties talked one way and voted another. He was not a teetotaller, but it was a question of keeping the Sabbath without desecration and what tended to desecrate it more than the way public-houses were kept open. Some one said it was quite optional to have a six day's licenae, but that was quite a mistake for 95 per cent of the public-houses were in the hands of the brewers and persons had to take their licenses as they were handed to them.

The mayor said he never was so much surprided in his life as when he heard this talked about as being a question of part y polities and Imperial question. Such an idea never came across his mind when he put the notice on the *agenda*. If he had thought so he certainly should not have raised it, but he looked upon it as one that concerned the welfare of that Borough and no farther. He was astonished at Councillor Riddett saying that his sympathies were with the question of temperance and yet he could not support the petition. It was an enigma to him.

Councillor Riddett explained his meaning, which the Mayor said was the same thing.

Councillor ALLEN said he must be another enigma.

The Mayor said it dad been said that Scotland was the most drunken place in the world, but he denied it in toto. In Ireland, where public-bowies were shut up the whole of the Sabbaths they would find that the decreased percentage of crime was so very marked that it could not leave a doubt on any reasonable man's mind of the good effects of closing such houses.

He put the resolution to the meeting. Councillors Ellery, Gunn, and Newbold left the room previously to the vote being given. Alderman Wallis and Councillors Riddett, Allen, James, Spencer, Dixon and Sweetman voted against the resolution. The ten other members voted in the affirmative and the Mayor declared the resolution carried. The Borough seal was then affixed to the petition, which was ordered to be forwarded to the proper quarter.

```{admonition} RYDE TOWN COUNCIL. - Saturday, July 12th, 1879
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790712/012/0006), 1879-07-12, p. 6

A meeting of the Council was held on Tuesday afternoon, when there were present the Mayor (Alderman B. Barrow) ; Aldermen, Wallis, Colenutt, Futcher, Harrington, and Dashwood ; Councillors Newbald, Riddett, Whittington, Allen, James, Spencer, Ellery, Barton, Dixon, Purnell, Comden, Sweetman, and Marvin.

...

CLOSING OF PUBLIC HOUSES ON SUNDAYS.

The Mayor said the next proposition was the one he had placed on the agenda paper himself, and with which he hoped the Council would acquiesce. It had long been the custom for the baker, grocer, and the other traders to close their establishments on Sunday, the only exception to the general rule were the publicans, and why they should keep open for the convenience of travellers, or pretended travellers, he could never understand. They could not, having regard to the enormous increase of drunkenness in the country of late years, refuse to take into consideration such an important question as the closing of publichouses on the Sunday. After the great number of signatures appended to the petition which he was about to read to them, he thought it would only be right for the Council also to show what their feeling was in the matter. If it was only the keepers of the publichouses who were concerned in this, there might be some reason why they should continue the present state of things, but there were barmen and barwomen constantly employed behind the bar, with no opportunity of a days rest, and exposed to a great deal of evil. He therefore begged to move that the seal of the Corporation be affixed to the petition to Parliament (read) for closing publichouses on Sundays.

Mr. Barton seconded.

Mr. Wallis said he could not support this resolution. He had nothing to say on the merits of the petition, but he opposed on the ground that this was and Imperial measure and had nothing to do with our municipal institutions at all. This was the ground taken by Mr. Pittis in a similar discussion in the Town Council at Newport. The discussion of anything outside the ordinary municipal work before them he considered was very undesirable. This was opening up a party question, such as was likely to evoke party feeling in the members of the Town Council, which ought never to be done. Supposing they were asked to seal a petition in favour of the abolition of the flogging in the army, such could not fail to evoke party feeling inasmuch as the Conservatives were determined to carry it through and the others to stop it, and the question now before them would become a party question in a similar way. It would not matter if the members of the Town Council signed in their ordinary capacity, but to seal the petition with the seal of the Corporation he considered was very undesirable. This was got up by the temperance party, for he did not believe the Mayor got it up himself, and as he thought it was needlessly introducing the ques- tion of party politics he should vote against it.

Mr. Spencer said that he too should vote against it for the reasons advanced by the last speaker. He was not aware that he was elected by the burgesses to discuss any question of this sort, and he thought it was very unwise to bring such questions before the Town Council. On the merits of the petition too he must say that he should be inclined to vote against it as he saw no reason for altering the pre- sent law. The publican could close bis house on Sunday now if he chose.

The Mayor.— They are bound to keep open certain hours.

Mr. Spencer said they had the option, if they chose, of taking out six days' licences. It was also very well for gentlemen who had a wine cellar and kept a their ales and spirits indoors to talk in this manner All they had to do was to tell the butler to bring up a bottle when they thought they would like one. The poor man could not do that, and he should say to gentlemen like the Mayor who took up this question, " You wish to deprive the poor man of a luxury which you indulge in yourself." If the public houses were such a nuisance as the Mayor implied ———

The Mayor.— I never said so. I never said they were a nuisance.

Mr. Spencer. — Well if you did not make use of the exact words that was evidently your meaning.

The Mayor. — Excuse me, I never said anything of the sort.

Mr. Spencer. — The very fact of your desiring to send such a petition as this shows that you regard publichouses as nuisances. It is perfectly plain to me that was your moaning, and if you bring forward such a motion as this we have a right to say that we don't regard publichouses quite in the same light as you do. You did not expect to bring this before the Council and get it passed without some opposition, did you : and I suppose we have a right to express our opinion.

The Mayor. — You are very unfair. I never said or hinted that anything was a nuisance, nor did I suppose that I was going to thrust this dowu the throats of the Council without hearing their opinion, I novcr said anything of the sort.

Mr. Spencer. — Well I understood just so. He would not vote for this, for the reasons given by Mr. Wallis. They might as well have a petition in favour of the Tichborne Claimant, or the Army Discipline Bill, or thousands of other matters, it all came to the same thing eventually. This must become a question oi party politics (uo). Unless this matter wore taken up by a party it would be useless to expect, private members to do so. Therefore he did not see what use it was to send the petition.

Mr. Purnell said that flogging in the Army and the Tichborne trial were very different to this. There was no comparison, for they did net come within their experience, while the other thing was right in their midst. He should think indeed that they had something to do with it ; it was really a town question. He should like those who opposed to live the same as he had done opposite to a public-house open on Sunday, and they would see whether it was a nuisance or not. As for Mr. Spencer saying that the publicans could close now, why the brewers would not let them. If they could he believed they would all shut up. He thought it was a capital motion, in fact the best motion the Mayor had brought forward since he had known him (hear, hear, and laughter).

Mr. James said that he stood midway between some of the last speakers and the teetotallers. He had not entered a publichouse himself on Sunday for 20 years, but yet he should be very sorry to curtail his neighbour's liberty in that respect. He considered this an imperial question, and as he had voted before against the discussion of imperial topics there, he should do so now. He should like to know exactly what was a publichouse. Were refreshment bars at railways to be closed? for if so, an immense amount of hardship would be entailed on a great many. He thought there were too many publichouses now, but he was bound to admit that during the five years the Mayor had sat on the bench he had not once refused to renew one of their licenses.

The Mayor. — Unfortunately, no. We can only refuse to grant new ones, not old ones.

Mr. Newbald did not see why they should attempt to close publichouses. Why not attempt to close clubs also on Sundays ?

Alderman Colenutt `[misattributed; corrected a week later to Alderman Harringotn]` did not see how this could be called a question of imperial politics ; it was rather a social one. He should think that the social condition of the people was to some extent of interest to municipal authorities, and if Parliament gave municipal authorities power to deal with drunkenness, it was quite legitimate for a Town Council to interfere as regards the vending of an article which did so much damage. It might be said that he had trafficked himself in the article, but he never sold any on a Sunday, and was not aware that his business ever profited by Sunday trading. One speaker had called drink a luxury. All he could say was that it would be a good thing if the luxury did not bring so much poverty and misery in its train. He had been acquainted with many working men, and in almost every instance where you found distress and that the family of children were not cared for, you could trace it to drink. There was a greater temptation for men to drink on Sunday than any other day, and he considered the closing of publichouses therefore would be productive of social benefit.

Alderman Harrington also supported in a lengthy speech, in the course of which he said that this question of temperance ought to be made a religious question, and he believed the clergy and ministers of England were largely to blame for the amount of crime we had ("question," and Mr. Newbald walked out in an abrupt and suggestive manner). In the course of some lengthy remarks, Mr. Harrington referred to the temperance of the Mahometans, said Scotland was the most drunken country to be found (" question"), and gave some valuable statistical information as to exports and imports. We had been descending rather than rising with regard to our general state of prosperity, and one serious cause of this he believed to be drink. He was not a teetotaller. [Mr. Spencer : Then you ought to be.] He thought there was too much freedom now. Every one was free to go to the devil his own way, but for himself he should like to see that liberty curtailed.

Mr. Riddett said that viewing the extent of ground over which the last speaker travelled showed the danger they ran in wasting their time by the discus- sion of such questions. [Alderman Harrington (indignantly). — Be careful what you are talking about !] He did not specially refer to the last speaker.

Alderman Colenutt. — Any discussion of such an important social question as this cannot be called waste of time.

Alderman Harrington. — The youngest member in the room telling me such a thing ! I won't have it.

Mr. Riddett said almost the first question he was called upon to discuss when he entered the Council was whether marriage with a deceased wife's sister ought to be legalised. He expressed his opinion then that in discussing such questions they were going away from legitimate business. He might say that he had great sympathy with the efforts which were now being made to lessen intemperance and to secure to all classes a Sabbath day of rest. He thought, however, that legislation should be very cautious in this matter, and he was not prepared to vote suddenly in such a wide question which touched other interests besides those of the publichouse keepers. He would not say, however, that he had no sympathy with the principle of the resolution.

Alderman Dashwood said that if any one could show him that the evils arising from intemperance were not greater than all causes put together then there would be some reason for asking him not to support this resolution. How gentlemen could shelter themselves from their responsibility of givuv a vote he could not understand. Nor coidd he understand how one gentleman could get up and say "My sympathy goes one way but my vote goes another."

Mr. Riddett. — Who said so ?

Alderman Dashwood.— You.— He was not a tee-totaller, for he was not prejudiced against a good glass of wine.

Mr. James.— Then you ought to be. You want to do away with it.

Alderman Dashwood said it was as much a question of keeping Sunday undescrated as anything else. What could be greater desecration of the Sabbath than to see all these public houses open ? As for saying it was optional with the publicans, and they could get six days' licences if they liked, it was nothing of the sort. Quite 95 per cent, of the publichouses were in the hands of the brewers, and the publicans had to sell as much beer as he possibly could, and many of this class had told him how glad they would be if they could close on Sunday.

The Mayor said that no idea of party or imperial politics ever crossed his mind when he placed this motion the agenda. He considered it a social question which concerned this borough as it concerned every other. They might just as well deny the right of the Watch Committee to interfere with police, who were under the supervision of the Imperial Governmeut, as their right to speak and discuss a question like that before them. Of all the speakers, however, the one who had astonished him most was Mr. Riddett, who told him that his sympathy went in support of the petition but that he should vote against it. That to him was an enigma which he would not attempt to explain.

Mr. Riddett said that the Mayor had misreprepresented him. What he did say was that although he had sympathy with those who were endeavouring to get rest for the Sabbath Day, he should not support this unless other interests besides those of publicans' houses were considered.

Mr. Allen.— I merely rise to say that I shall be another " enigma " Mr. Mayor.

The Mayor said that Mr. Riddett seemed to have expressed just the same idea as before. If there was anything destructive of the morality and reli- gion of the country he believed it was the drunkenness which was brought about by publichouses bemg kept open on the Sunday. He would close (it he had his way) every publichouse from 9 o'clock on Saturday till Monday morning. As to what had been said about preventing the poor man enjoying a luxury which the rich could not, that was a baby argument (laughter), because if they wanted beer they could buy it over night and bottle it. He had heard it said that Scotland was the most drunken country He denied it in toto. Ireland had been, but if they would only take the statistics of crime in Irish town- where they had closed the publichouses on Sunday, the per centage of crime was so much less that no one could doubt as to the good effects of closing those houses.

He then put the motion, which was carried. For it— The Mayor, Aldermen Colenutt, Futcher, Harrington, Dashwood, Whittington, Marvin, Purnell Barton, and Com Jen. Messrs. Gunn and Newbald had left, and those remaining were against.

```{admonition} RYDE, THURSDAY, JULY 17, 1879. - Thursday, July 17th, 1879
:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Times](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002100/18790717/088/0004), 1879-07-17, p. 4

The course which the Ryde Town Council took last week, with regard to the petition in favour of closing publichouses on Sundays, must have met with the approbation of the majority of our fellow-townsmen, and of many of the publicans also. The general feeling of the meeting exhibited by those who dissented from the petition being sealed, was in favour of the movement, but their objection was on the ground that it was a matter of Imperial and not of local politics. This seemed a correct view to take, inasmuch, as the principle implied in the Premissive Bill has not yet been legislatively brought into the law of England, over the sale of intoxicating beverages. On the other hand it was urged, on quite as good a basis, that the matter was not yet a question of party polities, but one which seriously affected our social interest : that the question was not one of Imperial politics even, so much as essentially a social one, and that moreover, open public-houses on the Sunday very seriously deteriorated the value of property. Many of the argument. brought forward, although, everyway applicable to manufacturing towns, had locally but little weight. The population of Ryde and its neighbourhood being a highclass one and, therefore, not subjected to the too prevalent bad habits of workingmen. On reading the report, which we published last week, it is easy to see that the subject was one which affected individual and pocket interests, as well as the social well-being of our Borough, but the neutrality of Councillors. Ellery, Gunn, and Newbald, placed the majority of the votes on the side of law and order. We cannot help thinking that the most important speech, during the late discussion, was that of Alderman Harrington, which in our last report, unfortunately, by an accident, was attributed to Alderman Colenutt. He looked on Intoxicating beverages as luxuries, and such undoubtedly they are, and the most expensive of the present age. He reviewed it from a social, personal, domestic, and religious, point of view, and put forward the important suggestion hat the Corporate bodies of the Kingdom should have full control over licensed houses, instead of the Magistrate. If, however, this course were pursued there would be the great danger that the publican interest would be more rampant than under the present system. In the majority of English towns it is the publican interest that secures the election of anti-teetotal candidates at municipal and general elections. The position the Mayor assumed was not that the control of the liquor traffic is not an Imperial question, for that is, at once, self-evident to anyone, but that in no sense did he look upon it locally as a question of Parliamentary, or of Party Politics, when the sanctity of the Sabbath is concerned. This seemed misunderstood by some of the members of the Council, for no good man would attempt to call into question the correctness of this view of the matter. When Alderman Harrington said that it was a subject to be dealt with by the " religious influence" he took up a strong position, and if this course were but followed up by the clergy of all denominations, there would soon be no need for the interference of the Government, for Sunday custom would become speedily extinct and publicans would close their houses when there was no longer any demand. A most important part of the subject is the Sunday labour, which is entailed on so many thousands of bar-girls, by those unfortunate individuals, who think that they would die if they did not gratify their drinking propensities on the Sunday. Many of these young women have to work seven days in the week, and have virtually no Sabbath free from the helotry of the bar.
