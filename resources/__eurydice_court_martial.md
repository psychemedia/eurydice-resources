Yesterday the inquiry into the loss of her Majesty's ship Eurydice, which foundered of Dunnose Point, Isle of Wight, on March 24 last, was opened on board the Duke of Wellington flagship, Portsmouth. The Court was formally opened at half past 10 o'clcok as a court-martial on the two survivors of the Eurydice —Benjamin Cuddeford, Able Seaman, and Sydney Fletcher, Ordinary Seaman; but so soon as they had given their evidence they were discharged, and other testimony was gone into. The Court was composed of the following Officers:—  Admiral E. G. Fanshawe, C.B, Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, president; Captains Carpenter (Duke of Wellington), M. Jones (Asia), Arthur (Vernon), J. E. Erakine (Boadicea), F. T. Thomson (Victoria and Albert), E. Kelly (Cyclops), D. G. Davidson (Serapis), C. J. Brownrigg (Euphrates), G. Parsons (Jumna), and F. P. Doughty (Crocodile).


Benjamin Cuddeford, who was first sworn, said: "I was an able-bodied Seaman on board her Majesty’s ship Eurydice on March 24. The statement now read is the statement I made before the coroner. It is true account of what I said and did on March 24. In reply to the President witness said: I have been to sea 21 years. I have been able-bodied Seaman for 14 years. On board the Eurydice I was at first Captain's Coxswain, and at the time of the accident I was Second Captain of the quarter-deck. It was my afternoon watch on Sunday, March 24. It was the custom on board the Eurydice for men not on the watch to remain below until wanted for duty. I was on deck nearly the whole the afternoon, and I saw Captain Hare on deck and on the bridge at various intervals. I remember seeing him on deck at half-past 12 o'clock, and at 10 minutes past 2 o'clock. I saw him on deck again shortly after half-past 3. He then on the bridge. My watch came on duty shortly after half-past 3. Afterwards an order was given to set starboard and studding sails, and more sail was subsequently set. Soon after the watch was called to shorten sail, which was done. I cannot now remember who was the Officer of the watch. I think it was Mr. Randolph, Sub-Lieutenant.

The President: When the order was given to shorten sail what sails were ordered to be taken in ?

Witness- The Captain gave orders take in the upper sails, and he ordered the men down from aloft. The Officer of the watch was then forward assisting to take in the lower studdingsails which the Captain had ordered be taken in.

On what part the ship was the Captain?— He was carrying on duty on the quarter-deck, and the Officer of the watch was on the forecastle, where he had been sent by the Captain to assist in taking in the sail. From half-past 12 to 10 minutes past 2 o'clock, when the lower studdingsail was set, there was a moderate breeze blowing, and I noticed no difference in the weather until the squall came on. The ship was under all plain sail at 12 o'clock, and at 12 20 the topmast studdingsails were set, and later the lower studdingsails.

At what rate was the ship going ?—The leg was hove just after the lower studdingsail was set, and the ship was going at the rate of 8 1/2 knots per hour.

When the Captain gave the orders to take in the upper did name the sails, did he name the sails that were to taken in ?— The order he gave quickly was that "Watch upper sails."

Did the topgallant men go aloft ?—Some went aloft, but I do not remember the number. The starboard quarter boat was washed away about one minute after the order was given to shorten sail. It was about one minute after the Captain gave the order to the men to go aloft that the gale struck the Ship and she heeled right over. When the starboard quarter-bot was washed away the vessel was going, to the best of my knowledge, about 12 knots an hour.

Was the ship’s head altered during the successive events that you have described ?—I did not notice.

Did you at the time consider, as a Seaman, that everything was done during your afternoon watch on March 24 in a seamanlike manner likely to prevent danger to the ship ?— In my opinion everything was done in seamanlike manner, and no confusion prevailed.

Was that your opinion at the time ?— Yes.

What means were there for saving life board the ship? -There were two round buoys in the bow of each boat, and life-belts for all the Crew. The Eurydice sailed from Bermuda, I believe, on March 6.

Are you aware of any general order on board the Eurydice for closing the main deck ports either at fixed times or in the event of had weather or sudden squalls ?—No.

Were the main deck ports the deck ports open or closed? Were the sashes open or closed?— The main deck ports were open except two—one each side; the sashes the starboard side were not shipped. I cannot say whether the lower half ports were closed or open. I had a conversation with some the men on the main deck that afternoon, and I had an opportunity of seeing that the ports on the main deck were open.

Did the ship complete taking in provisions at Bermuda ? I believe so.

Did she take in as much provisions as she could stow ?—I don't know how much she took in. The provisions she took in were taken in at the last moment.

Hov long before you sailed from Bermuda did you take in your water supply ?—At the last moment.

Did you take any stores for conveyance to England? — Yes.

What did the stores comprise?— I saw some wire rigging and oilcans brought on board. I do not know where they stowed. Some were stowed on the lower deck during the passage. They were secured by cleats.

When the water tanks were empty on board the Enrydice were you in the habit of filling them up again with salt water?—No.

Was that ever done?—No.

Was there any alteration of the stowage of the ballast of the ship during the time you were in the ship?—None.

By the Court: After we left Bermuda restriction was was put on the use of water. During the time we were in commission we always wore white working rig. When Sen we wore a blue working rig, and this saved a great deal of water in washing.

What was the state of the weather on March 24 ?—Moderate up to 3 o’clock.

Was it squally or threatening ?—No; there was a steady breeze blowing. The sun shone brightly at times. I did not notice any clouds banking up.

Did the squall shrike you as having the appearance of an ordinary one ?—I was busy at the time, and did not notice.

Did yon notice when the ship first began to draw from under the land ?—No.

Had you yourself every confidence in the ship's stability ? Yes.

What was the general feeling amongst the ship's company as to her stability?—I do not know.

Did you ever hear any of the Crew express distrust as to her stabiiity ?—No.

Where did you last aee the Captain, and what was be doing? -He was right aft on the bottom of the ship. He was standing still. The last words I hand him say were, "It is of no avail." The standing rigging was wire, not rope. The topmast and topgallant rigging was also wire. When the squall struck the vessel nothing was carried away, to the best of my knowledge. I think I made a mistake with regard to the topgallant standing rigging. It was not wire, but rope.

Sydney Fletcher, Ordinary Seaman, was next called and sworn. The evidence which he gave at the coroner's inquest, held at Ventnor on March 27, was read over to him. In his cross-examination he stated that the Mate of the main deck issued a general order that the ports should be closed when it was observed that a squall or bad weather was coming on. The provision-room filled at Bermuda.

Captain G. P. Polkinghorne produced a chart showing the position of her Majesty's ship Enrydioe at midnight on March 24 last, and the report made by witness to the Admiral Superintendent as to the position of the Eurydice when discovered by the Camel tug was put in and read.

Mr. R. B. Baker, retired Nautical Assessor of the Board of Trade, deposed that he wrote a letter to Admiral Fanshawe on March 25 last in which he stated " Yesterday (Sunday, March 24) I was in the verandah of my house at 4pm., when the unfortunate vessel which has just foundered hove sight. I made her out to be a frigate under full sail, royals and also foretopmast and lower studdsails, with her yards braced well forward, on the port tack, wind then about N.W, ship heading about N.E. All the time squall was brewing from about N.N.W., thick and dense. I became interested, as the ship continued to carry the same sail. I saw the royal either taken in or something carried away. I supposed the latter, as it is unusual for men-of-war to take in any one royal at a time. After a few minutes the squall burst upon my house with considerable violence, accompanied by heavy drifting snow. It must have struck the ship in two or three seconds after, blew directly towards her. In about 10 or 15 minutes it cleared again, and the ship wns not then in sight. My object in writing is to state facts, and may tend to exonerate the unfortunate Commander of the frigate. This squall did not to me appear to have much wind in it, but to be merely a heavy downfall of either rain or snow, and I think it was likely whoever was in charge of the deck of the frigate may have been deceived, as I was, particularly as the wind was light and the weather fine before the squall. It has struck me that any exoneration from carelessness may be gratifying to the friends of those in command or on duty at the time of the dreadful calamitv. I have no hesitation saying that the snowstorm clearly did not assume the appearance of such a gust of wind as followed it. The barometer had been falling; but the weather remained fine, and, consequently, was very deceptive. I thought they were to reduce sail in frigate fashion; but, unfortunately, if it was so, it was too late."

Captain Carpenter: Was there anything in the configuration of the land to prevent those on board the Eurydice from seeing the squall ? I do not think so; it covered such a space, and was so dense. The squall must have been seen after the ship steamed out from Dunnose. I expected to see the vessel shorten sail; but I thought that those on board desired to take the sails in together smartly— frigate-like.

Admiral Robert Tryon deposed to seeing the Eurydleo pass Ventnor on the afternoon of March 24 last. He noticed that her plain sail was set. There was a strong tide running against her, and though she might have been sailing at seven, yet she was not passing the land at more than four knots. The canvas the vessel was under was not more than she was justified in carrying, as there had been several snow squalls that morning off Ventnor unaccompanied by wind of any moment. When the Eurydice passed Ventnor there was a moderate breeze blowing off the land, the water was smooth, and the sun was shining brightly. Witness lost sight of the ship before the storm broke upon Ventnor, which it did shortly before 4 o'clock. A schooner passing Ventnor before the squall burst had hauled down her topsails.

Mr. James Chappel, Master of the Lord Vivian; Mr. Louttit, Master of the steamship Badger; and Mr. W. L. Jenkins, Master of the schooner Emnm, deposed to being at sea on March 24, and struck by the squall which capsized the Eurydice. They were of opinion that those on board the Eurydice could not see the storm approaching they were too does inshore. The inquiry was then adjourned until this day (Wednesday).

—The court-martial, which, by the rules of the Service, it was necessary to hold on the two survivors of H.M.S. Eurydice, was opened Tuesday before Admiral Fanshawe, on board the Duke of Wellington, flag ship. Both the survivors, Benjamin Cuddiford and Sidney Fletcher, stated that they were of opinion that everything had been done to secure the safety of the vessel. The masters of various craft which were off the Isle of Wight at the time of the occurrence were examined and said that the squall came on very suddenly, and that although they saw it in time to shorten sail, they believed those on board the Eurydice, from the position of the vessel, had not good an opportunity of knowing it was coming. The inquiry was then adjourned until Wednesday, when several witnesses were examined to the peculiarities of the fatal snow gale of the 24th of March. The inquiry was again adjourned.

[North Briton](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002745/18780831/046/0005), 1878-08-31, p. 5

On Tuesday an inquiry into the loss of H.M.S. Eurydice was opened on board the Duke of Wellington flagship, Portsmouth. Admiral Fnshawe, C.B., Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, presised, and there was a full attendance of officers. The Eurydice, sailing frigate, was lost off Dunnose Point, Isle of during a sudden violent squall, on Sunday, the 24th March last, when on her homeward voyage from the West Indies. The two survivors gave their evidence before the coroner at Ventnor. A court-martial was opened by the Admiralty, to be held on the survivors, Benjamin Cuddeford and Sydney Fletcher, seamen, but this is only formal, and a scientific inquiry will follow as to the construction of the ship, and her condition at the time of her loss. Depositions as to the loss of the ship were read.— Benjamin Cuddeford stated in evide nce that he had been at sea 21 rears, and he was on board the Eurydice about 14 months. He had been an able seaman for 14 years. On board the Eurydice he was at first captain's coxwain, and at the time of the accident he was second captain of the quarter deck. It was his afternoon watch on the 24th of March, but, as was customary in the Eurydice on a Sunday, the men on watch were allowed to remain below until wanted for duty. He was on deck nearly the whole of the afternoon of the 24th of March. He saw Captain Hare on deck at 12.30, and at ten minutes past two. He saw him again on deck just after half-past three. At the latter time he was on the bridge. Soon after the watch to which the witness belonged came on duty, an order was given to set starboard studding sails, and more sail was subsequently set. Just after half-past three the watch was called to shorten sail, and this was done. He could not now remember who was officer of the watch on this afternoon. It was to Mr Randolph, sub-lieutenant, that the captain give the ceders to take in upper sails and order the men down from aloft. The captain was carrying on duty at the quarter-deck, and the officer of the watch on the forecastle, where he had been sent by the captain to assist in taking in the lower studding sail. From 12.30 P.M. to 2.10 P.M., when the lower studding sail was set, a moderate breeze was blowing, and he noticed no difference until the squall came on. The ship was under all plain sail at 12 o'clock and at 12.30 topmast studding sails were set, and later on theslower studding sails. When the log was hove, just after the lower studding sail was set, the ship was going at eight and a half knots. The lower studding sail was taken in on account of the increasing wind, but when forward he did not notice that the fore topmast studding sail boom was "complaining." Had it been so he must have noticed it. The captain did not name the up sails which were to be taken in. He gave the order quickly "Watch, in upper sails. Some of the topgallantyard men went aloft, but he could not say how many. The captain immediately called them down again, and the ship was at once struck by the squall and heeled over. At that time the ship was going about 12 knots an hour. The order to put the helm up was given by the captain, and the Hon. Mr Giffard, a sub-lieutenant, rushed aft to help to execute it, but he could not say if the helm was put up or down. He never noticed that the ship's head was altered at all. As seaman, he considered everything was done in a seamanlike manner to prevent danger to the ship. Nothing was done which was likely to cause danger. There was a life-buoy on each side of the bridge, two in each boat, and life-belts in the cutter for her crew. He could not say if the lower deck scuttles were out that afternoon or not. He knew of no order for the Eurydice to close the main deck ports in bad weather or at fixed times. All the deck pors were open except two on each side. On the afternoon of the catastrophe the sashes of the ports were not shipped. Those which were not open had guns in them. The ship completed provision-taking at Bermuda, but he did not know how much she took in. The provisions and the water were taken in at the last moment. Stores were taken in for conveyance to ` England, amongst them being wire rigging. When the tanks of the Eurydice were empty they were not filled with salt water. Restrictions were made on the issue of water for washing purposes, and this made a great saving in water.

On Wednesday evidence was taken as to atmospheric phenomena observed between three and four o clock on the afternoon of the 24th March. The evidence showed that two squalls, accompanied by snow, followed rapidly after each other, the effect of the first being to deceive experienced men as to the nature of the second, which struck the Eurydice and caused her to founder. Both squalls lasted generally 15 minutes, and the sun shone brightly h before and after the disaster. Dismantling operations showed that several sails were loosened before the ship foundered.

The Deputy Judge Advocate gave the following judgment at the opening of tho court on Monday morning.

1. — At a Court-Martial assembled on board of the Duke of Wellington flagship, in Portsmouth Harbour, on Aug.27, 1878, to inquire into the loss of her Majesty's ship Eurydice, pursuant to the 91st and 92nd section of the Naval Discipline Act, 1886, do find that her Majesty's ship Eurydice foundered on the afternoon of March 24, 1878, by pressure of wind upon her sails during a sudden and exceptionally dense snowstorm which overtook her when its approach was partially hidden by the proximity of the ship to high land.

2. – Some of the upper half ports on the main deck were open at the time, which materially conduced to the catastrophe; but the court consider that the upper half ports having been open, was justifiable and usual under the state of wind and weather up to the time of the occurrence of the storm.

3. – The Court are of opinion that no blame is attributable to anyone. The captain was frequnetly on the deck during the afternoon, and personally carrying on the duty before and at the time the squall struck her.

4. – The Court are further of opinion, from documentary evidence that due consideration was given to the stability of the Eurydice when the dodges for her coustruition were decided upon and carried out.

5. – They are also convinced, by the official reports of ail the captains who commanded her as a 26-gun frigate, embracing a period of nearly ten years' sea service, and by a special report from Admiral Sir William Parker. on the occasion of her being tested against other ships of various descriptions, that the Eurydice was a ship possessing good qualities of stability up to the time that she was selected for adaptation as a training ship, nod that when the necessary alterations were completed in May, 1877, she was in every respect an efficient ship, and the evidence shows that her stability was maintained. The Court do fully acquit the survivors, Benjamin Cuddeford, able seaman, and Sydney Fletcher, ordinary seaman ; and the said Benjamin Cuddeford and Sydney Fletcher are hereby so fully acquitted accordingly.

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000170/18780907/006/0004?browse=true), 1878-09-07, p. 4-5

The court martial, at which the two survivors from the Eurydice were placed *pro forma* on their trial, has ended in their honourable acquittal, which, of course, was only to be expected. The court likewise declares that " no blame is attributable to any one." It is always a task repugnant to the sensitive mind to attach any blame to the dead, knowing that they cannot defend themselves ; and, in this instance, all those responsible for the disaster have paid for any error of judgement with their lives. Still we imagine that there are few persons acquainted with nautical matters who will altogether endorse the finding of the court, more especially among the seafaring population who witnessed the vessel just before the sad catastrophe which has been so much commented on. The Ventnor boatmen on the beach could see the squall coming, and, as the vessel passed off that town, several were heard to say, " That fellow has too much sail." How, then, are we to reconcile the fact of their perceiving the approach of stormy weather, and numerous other craft near passing through it without damage, with a finding that practically says the accident was unavoidable? Every person who remembers the storm, and who has read the evidence respecting it will be ready to admit that it was of exceptional severity, and that the accident was owing to the violent wind catching the sails when the lee ports were open. But there cannot be the slightest doubt that if Capt. Hare had kept his ports closed the sad event would not have happened, because then the ship would have righted directly after the one sharp gust was over. Here was one precaution neglected, and a very simple one. But, again, to our mind there can be no doubt that with a falling barometer the Eurydice was carrying too much sail. Had Capt. Hare but reduced it ever so little we should never have heard of the accident. Neither should we if he had ordered the ports to be closed. Here were two simple precautions, which might reasonably be expectedly to be carried out, but neither of which were attended to. He the land not been so closely hugged there could have been no excuse that it was impossible to perceive the storm coming. If, however, the Ventnor boatmen could see it as the Eurydice passed off that town, we cannot help thinking that it ought to have been seen on board the ill-fated ship. We must say, therefore, that we think blame attached somewhere, though of course we do not deny that there were many extenuating circumstances. The ship had just braved the dangers of an ocean voyage, and it was hard for the crew to believe that the greatest peril was to be first met on the threshold, as it were, of their own homes. They were anxious to get into harbour to see friends and I relatives again, as we can well understand, and a storm of such suddenness and force is not often met with in these waters. But there are hundreds of merchant ships who are daily met by the same conditions, and this is no excuse for reckless disregard of every elementary precaution. One of the London papers — the *Times*— argues that a constant regard for petty precautions is not to be expected from the captains of H.M.'s Navy, and, if encouraged, would be destructive of the spirit for which our seamen have always been distinguished. This may be true to a certain extent in war time, and we trust our Naval commanders will never be deficient in the courage aun spirit which has caused them to defy all dangers in their efforts to carry the British flag triumphant in every sea. Still, in peace, with none of the exigencies and hurry which are inseparable from a state of hostilities, there is no reason why our naval commanders should not be quite as cautious as the captains of ordinary trading vessels, more especially as they have more lives dependant upon their prudence and forethought.

TH: notable quote: "The ship had just braved the dangers of an ocean voyage, and it was hard for the crew to believe that the greatest peril was to be first met on the threshold, as it were, of their own homes.

[Illustrated Police News](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000072/18780907/018/0004), 1878-09-07, p. 4

The evidence at the "Eurydice " court-martial was closed on Saturday. A diver named Sutherland deposed to finding the scuttle on the lower deck closed; and Mr. W. D. Robinson, Chief Constructor at Portsmouth Yard, produced calculations, showing that in her last commission the " Eurydice " had fourteen tons less ballast than when sailed as a frigate. The fact that ninety tons of provisions had been consumed when she capsized would not compromise her stability to any serious degree if she was properly handled. Of course, under a loss of weight in the lower part of the ship she would necessarily have less stability. The officer managing her would know this, and, therefore, press her correspondingly less with sail. He should call this proper handling. The consumption of ninety tons of stores, provisions, and water would reduce the draught of the " Eurydice" by 9 in. There was nothing unusual in this reduction. Cuddeford was then asked by the Court whether he had anything to add before the evidence was closed, and he made a statement which he wished should be entered on the minutes. He desired it to be known that the crew loved and respected Captain Hare, in whom they had undoubted confidence, knowing that as a sailor he was surpassed by none. He had the love and respect of every officer and man in the ship, whose comfort and happiness he studied in every way. The men were proud of their captain, proud of their officers, and proud of their ship, which was admirably adapted to the service in which she was employed. Fletcher stated that he could a add nothing to what Cuddeford had stated. The Court deliberated for over three hours, and adjourned until Monday, when the judgment of the Court was pronounced. They were of opinion that the ship foundered in a sudden and exceptionally dense snow storm on March 24, by pressure of wind on sails, and that the upper half ports being justifiably open, considering the state of the previons wind and weather, naturally conduced to the catastrophe. No one is to blame, the captain being frequently on deck, and carrying on duty before and at the time the squall struck her. The Court is further of opinion that the stability was maintained after her adaptation as a training-ship, and that after alteration in May, 1877, she was in every respect an efficient ship. They fully acquit the two survivors. Cuddiford and Fletcher.

The work of clearing out the "Eurydice" commenced on Monday, and as soon as it can be done the ship is to be brought into dock to have a thorough overhaul. The wreck has been the attraction for numerous excursion parties, and the authorities have great difficulty in preserving the ship intact, so eager are persons to carry away pieces of wood as momentos of the sad calamity.

We shall soon have heard the last of the ill-fated Eurydice. The finding of the Court-martial was generally anticipated by the public, and it is understood that the bringing of the vessel into harbour will be quickly followed by her breaking up. The catastrophe of the 24th of March last was one of the darkest in the annals of the British Navy, and yet it is apparently destined to leave only the shadow of a sad memory behind. It has been said that the first impulse of our countrymen after any great disaster is to " hang somebody." This temper has been a good deal satirised, and yet it has to a large extent a strictly logical foundation. The scientific mind is slow to ascribe anything to pure accident. A catastrophe may have been unforeseen, but it is generally discovered on investigation that its cause is perfectly intelligible, and such as extreme vigilance might have detected, and consequently avoided. When the sad intelligence of the foundering of the Eurydice was first made known, we expressed the opinion that fearful as were all the circumstances surrounding the loss of the vessel, it would be still more terrible were the conclusion to be reached, after mature deliberation, that the cause of the disaster was a complete mystery. The verdict of the first Coroner's Jury, which exonerated everybody from blame, was clearly not entitled to serious attention. No scientific or technical evidence was taken, and a single sitting sufficed for the inquiry. This cannot be said of the recent Court-martial, which, arriving at the same conclusion, has spent a working week in its attempt to elucidate the mystery. The finding of the Court may be divided into two parts-first, that which relates to the stability of the ship ; and secondly, that which concerns her handling at the time she went down. On the first point there appears to be no ground for any difference of opinion. Admitting the incompetence of all but experts to deal with the technicalities of the subject, it cannot be said to require any special knowledge to judge of the value of the evidence bearing upon this branch of the inquiry which was laid before the Court-martial. The Eurydice had always the reputation of being a good sailor, and it must now be regarded as beyond dispute that her conversion from a frigate into a training-ship in no degree diminished her stability. It is true the question of her stability was not specially considered when the plans for her conversion were originally under discussion, but this was only because the proposed changes were obviously such as to require no examination on this point. Since his attention has been particularly directed to this subject, Mr. Barnaby has come to the conclusion that the Euryjdice rather gained than lost in stability by her conversion, and Mr. W. B. Robinson is of the same opinion. Whatever, then, was the cause of the catastrophe it cannot be attributed to any positive or even comparative defects in the ship herself.

This should lead us to examine the other branch of the subject all the more closely. If the Eurydice foundered from no inherent fault of her own, was there anything in her handling on the fatal Sunday afternoon which caused the terrible result? The Court-martial declares that there was not, and yet the very language of the finding raises doubts which cannot, and honestly speaking, ought not to be suppressed. The immediate cause of the catastrophe was, of course, the sudden storm which for a few minutes raged with cyclonic fury, but as other vessels rode it out in safety some further explanation is obviously required. This is, in effect, acknowledged by the Court, which proceeds to say that " some of the upper ports on the main deck were open at the time, which materially conduced to the catastrophe," though the important addition is made that this step " was justifiable and usual under the state of the wind and weather up to the time of the actual occurrence of the storm." Here we reach the very root of the whole inquiry. Did the state of the weather really permit of such confidence as was displayed on board the Eurydice? The barometer had been falling for a couple of days or more, while the indications of a coming storm, though it may be " partially hidden," as the verdict recites, " by the proximity of the ship to high land," was so far apparent that the order to shorten sail had already been given and was actually in process of being obeyed. Is it wrong or uncharitable, under these circumstances, to surmise that the course pursued amounted to an error of judgment? It was impossible to anticipate the altogether exceptional fury of the gale, but would not the exercise of a little caution have made all the difference between entire safety and utter destruction? "It must be understood," observes the Times, in dealing with this part of the case, " that in the naval service a creeping servitude to caution would be intolerable." This principle is no doubt admirable in the exigencies of actual warfare, but it cannot be said to have any application to a vessel when simply making for port and within sight of "home." To suppose otherwise would be to infer that the commander of the Eurydice and his gallant companions knew the risk they were running, and were determined to brave it at all hazards. Fortunately no such foolhardy intention can be attributed to them. That each man did his duty according to his lights will be admitted by the most exacting of critics. What is not so certain is that the soundness of judgment exhibited on this occasion was of apiece with that courage and indomitable resolution which the British sailor evinces in every emergency.

:class: note dropdown

[Isle of Wight Observer](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18780907/016/0006), 1878-09-07, p. 6

The court re-assembled on Monday morning at at 10 o'clock, and was formally opened at half-past 12, when the Judge Advocate-General of the Fleet read the following judgment :

At a court martial assembled on board of the Duke of Wellington, flagship, in Portmouth Harbour, on the 27th of August, 1878, to inquire Into the loss of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, pursuant to the 91st and 92nd section of the Naval Discipline Act, 1866, composed of the following officers- Admiral Fanshawe, C.B., Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, president; Captains the Hon. W. C. Carpenter, Duke of Wellington; Messrs. T. M. Jones, Asia; W. Arthur, Vernon ; J. E. Erskine, Boadicea; E Kelly, Cyclops; D. G. Davidson, Serabis; E J. Brownrigg, Euphrates; G Parsons, Jumna ; and Mr. G. P. Martin, Deputy Judge-Advocate of the Fleet, and adjourned from day to day (Sunday excepted) until Monday, September 2, the court, pursuant to an order from the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland, proceeded with the trial of the said Benjamin Cuddiford and Sydney Fletcher, of Her Majesty's ship Eurydice, and taking their evidence, and the other evidence they deemed necessary, and having deliberately weighed and considered the whole, do find that Her Majesty's ship Eurydice foundered on the afternoon of the 24th March, 1878, by pressure of wind upon her sail during a sudden and exceptionally dense snowstorm which overtook her when the approach was partially hidden by the proximity of the ship to high land.

2. Some of the upper half ports on the main deck were open at the time, which materially conduced to the catastrophe; but the court consider that the upper half ports having been open was justifiable and usual under the state of wind and weather up to the time of the actual occurrence of the storm.

3. The court are of opinion that no blame is attributable to any one. The captain was frequently on the deck during the afternoon, anel personally carrying on the duty before and at the time the squall struck her.

4. The court arc further of opinion, from documentary evidence, that due consideration was given to the question of the stability of the Eurydice when the designs for her construction were decided upon and carried out.
 
5. They are also convinced, by the official reports of all the captains who commanded her as a 26-gun frigate embracing a period of nearly ten years' sea service, and by a special report from Admiral Sir William Parker on the occasion of her being tested against other ships of various descriptions, that the Eurydice was a ship possessing good qualities of stability up to the time that she was selected for adaptation as a training ship, and that when the necessary alterations were completed in May, 1577, she was in every respect an efficient ship, and the evidence shows that her stability was maintained.
 
The court do fully acquit the survivors, Benjamin Cuddiford, able seaman, and Sydney Fletcher, ordinary seaman, and the said Benjamin Cuddiford and Sydney Fletcher are hereby so fully acquitted accordingly. The court then dissolved. 
 

The Eurydice was towed into Portsmouth Harbour on Sunday, the leaks having been to a great extent closed, and the water pumped out until she drew only two feet more than her proper draught. The ill-fated vessel, which has been laid up alongside the old hulk Laurel in Portehester Cree, a continuation of Portsmouth Harbour, continues to be the centre of attraction. The wreck so recently recovered from the deep is, however, zealously guarded by a detachment of Marines, until the work of clearing out has been finished. The entire centre of the upper deck is washed away through the violence of the waves during the time the wreck lay in Sandown Bay. The planks placed crosswise form a means of communication from one part of the upper deck to the other. On going below a scene of chaotic confusion presents itself. Most of the gear has been removed from the main deck and many of the cabins are knocked away, but the deck is still littered with the broken spars and rigging. The lower deck is littered with *debris* from end to end, and the whole is covered with a muddy slime several inches deep. Officers' chests, men's clothes bags, beer barrels, bird cages, pickle bottles, surgical cases and instruments, which have fallen from the adjacent dispensary, lie upon the deck, a heterogeneous and confused mess. Locomotion between decks in consequence of the quantity of mud which  has been washed in is extremely difficult. The main-mast, the lower, part of which still remains in the ship, was hoisted up out of the vessel, a distance of nearly six feet, by the bumping action to which the vessel was subjected. The starboard side of the lower deck has also been considerably lifted owing to the action of the sea. Right aft, on the lower deck is situated the bread room, from which a most intolerable stench proceeded from the decomposed bread and other provisions, notwithstanding the fact that the decks are continually washed by carbonic acid. The captain's cabin has been entirely removed. On the lower deck are several cells, in one of which a prisoner was found, minus his head. The poor fellow was not chained, but another one at large on the lower deck was. The irons hay been found near the mainmast, but no body. The hold is at present impossible to get down into owing to the fact that all the movable gear near the spot has been rolled into them and choked them up. In making room for the suction pipes to go down between the lumber into the hold the divers came across a body jammed in, and supposed to be that of the bread room boy. Several articles of uniform clothing lie scattered about the lower deck, amongst which was a decent undress uniform coat. The working party came across a skull, but no more bodies. In case the vessel should meet with any untoward accident, anchors have been laid out from her, so that in case the necessity should arise she can be immediately hauled up on to the mud. One of the steam engines got to work periodically continues to be sufficient to keep the water under. As soon as possible, the work of clearing out the ship, a labour of considerable magnitude, will be concluded, and the vessel fumigated and brought into port ; but this is not likely to take place for at least a fortnight.
