Poetry - The Home-Coming of the Eurydice

[Lost, with her crew of three hundred boys, on the last day of her voyage, March 23, 1876. She foundered off Portsmouth, from which town many of the boys came.]

Up with the royals that top the white spread of her!  
Press her and dress her, and drive through the foam;  
The Island's to port, and the mainland ahead of her,  
Hey for the Warner and Hayling and Home!

"Bo'sun, O Bo'sun, just look at the green of it!  
Look at the red cattle down by the hedge!  
Look at the farmsteading—all that is seen of it,  
One little gable end over the edge!"

"Lord! the tongues of them clattering, clattering,  
All growing wild at a peep of the Wight;  
Aye, sir, aye, it has set them all chattering,  
Thinking of home and their mothers to-night."

Spread the topgallants — oh, lay them out lustily!  
What though it darken o'er Netherby Combe?  
'Tis but the valley wind, puffing so gustily—  
On for the Warner and Hayling and Home!

"Bo'sun, O Bo'sun, just see the long slope of it!  
Culver is there, with the cliff and the light.  
Tell us, oh tell us, now is there a hope of it?  
Shall we have leave for our homes for to-night?"

"Tut, the clack of them! Steadily! Steadily!  
Aye, as you say, sir, they're little ones still;  
One long reach should open it readily,  
Round by St. Helens and under the hill.

"The Spit and the Nab are the gates of the promise,  
Their mothers to them—and to us it's our wives.  
I've sailed forty years, and—By God it's upon us!  
Down royals, Down top'sles, down, down, for your lives!"

A grey swirl of snow with the squall at the back of it,  
Heeling her, reeling her, beating her down!  
A gleam of her bends in the thick of the wrack of it,  
A flutter of white in the eddies of brown.

It broke in one moment of blizzard and blindness;  
The next, like a foul bat, it flapped on its way.  
But our ship and our boys! Gracious Lord, in your kindness,  
Give help to the mothers who need it to-day!

Give help to the women who wait by the water,  
Who stand on the Hard with their eyes past the Wight.  
Ah! whisper it gently, you sister or daughter,  
"Our boys are all gathered at home for to-night."

POETRY - THE LAST OF THE EURYDICE.

Sunday, March 24, 1878.

The training-ship Eurydice—  
As brave a craft, I ween,  
As ever bore brave men who loved  
Their country and their Queen-  
Built when ship, sir, *was* a ship,  
And not a steam machine.  

A year or more she had been out  
About the Indian seas;  
And now, with all her canvas bent  
Before homeward breeze,  
Channel in her pride she came.  
The saucy Eurydice.  

"Only an hour from Spithead, lads:  
Only an hour from home !"  
So sang the captain's cheery voice  
As she clove the sunlit foam ;  
And each young sea-dog's heart sang back,  
"Only hour from home !"

We saw the hills of Devon rise  
Fair in the Sabbath sun.  
We marked each hamlet gleaming white  
The church spires one by one.  
We thought we heard the church bells ring  
To hail our voyage done !

No warning ripple crisped the wave,  
To tell of danger nigh,  
Nor looming rack, nor driving scud—  
From out smiling sky,  
With sound as the trump of doom,  
The squall broke suddenly.

A giant squall of wind and snow  
From off the Devon shore,  
It caught us in its blinding whirl  
One instant, and more—  
For ere we dreamt of trouble near  
All earthly hope was o'er.

No time to shorten sail- no time  
To change the vessel's course ;  
The squall had caught her crowded masts  
With swift, resistless force.  
Only one shrill, despairing cry  
Rose o'er the turmoil hoarse,

And broadside the great ship went down  
Amid the swirling foam ;  
And with her our four Hundred men  
Went down, in sight home  
(Fletcher and I alone were saved)–  
Only an hour from home .

March 25- *Noel Paton, in the Scotsman*

Poetry - THE LOSS OF THE "EURYDICE," SUNDAY, MARCH 25, 1878.

O'er the calm bosom of the treacherous sea,  
The bright sun-shining on each snowy sail,  
Onward she speeds, though shortly doomed to be  
A victim to the fury of the gale.  
Oae gust of wind, one blinding cloud of snow  
That cast a gloom around her like the night,  
One bitter cry of agony and woe,  
And she had sunk for ever from our sight.  

Fond hearts were waiting for her quiok return,  
Fond eyea were gazing far across the main ;  
Long may they watch, and long those hearts may yearn,  
For those on earth they ne'er will see again !  
Hearths will be desolate which were not so ;  
Loud the sad cry is heard on every side,  
And mourners weep in bitterness of woe  
For those who in their country's service died.  

All England feels for those who now are left,  
Widowed and fatherless, their loss to mourn ;  
Of all their lived unes suddenly bereft  
By fearful violence of tne pissing storm !  
Shine down, O sun, with thy bright cheering face,  
The world roils on as it has done before ;  
Grant those who died have found iheir resting place  
Above, where troubles shall be known no mure.  

W. Stanley Smiih.

Ryde, March 25th, 1878.

Poetry - FOUNDERING OF THE "EURYDICE" IN SANDOWN BAY.

Men stood aghast, as well they might, to hear  
The dreadful news last Monday morning brought:  
A gallant ship, with past three hundred souls,  
Hallf founded in the Bay on Sunday eve !  
So awful sudden this catastrophe  
That not a token reached tne dwellers by  
To tell them hundreds of their fellow men  
Were, within eye-ken, struggling for their lives.  
No sadder tale has ever yet been told  
Or shipwreck's horror, sudden aud complete : —  
A noble frigate, gaily homeward bound,  
All her full press of suow-white canvas set,  
In swan-like state came sailing past our Bay.  
Over the waves majestic'ly she glides,  
Replete with life aud lignt —a nation's pride—  
An emblem of our rule upon the sea —  
A sight to charm the eye and stir the pulse.  
Sudden as ligutning's strike, from Culver's brow  
Swoops tne fierce squall, 'midst blinding sleet and snow,  
And, like a tiger springing on its prey,  
Bore down that gallant vessel to her doom.  
One moment saw her proudly ride thi waves  
Exultant in her beauty aud her strength ;  
The next, behind that curtain-cloud of storm.  
Hopelessly stricken, crushed, and settling down.  
So sank ihe Eurydice — as smart a craft  
As ever bore our meteor flag aloft.

Home from the West Indies she had sped,  
With wide-spread wings, aud many a favouring gale,  
Till England's longed-for shores were reached at last :  
Then, up the Channel, proud of har past fame,  
The brave old frigate pressed upon her way,  
With tensioned canvas spread ; to gain her port  
She rounds the Wight, and there before her lies  
The hoped-for haven— Portsmouth — full in sight,  
With home aud kindling holding welcome out,  
Almost within the sea-worn wauderor's grasp.  
God! wnat a moment that to be struck down ;  
To change home's welcome for a watery grave ;  
To strew three hundred corses on the shore  
Where stalwart tonus, full of high hope and life,  
Were looked for by thair kindred and their Queen.

The news has cast a grief-cloud o'er the land,  
Dark'ning alike the palace aud the cot ;  
And words of heartfelt sympathy well forth  
For those thus lost to us, aud those bereaved.  
In meek submission to the Divine will  
We gather now our dead, who nobly died  
In full discharge of duty — even so,  
As though they fell in battle, face to face  
With England's direst foe. Above their grave  
The sea lies calm, aud golden-tinted clouds  
Look down witn a mild pity on the spot  
Where lies tne Eurydice ahd her brave crew.

Thomas Maton. Sandown, March 26th, 1878.

The following lines (signed "F. G.") on the loss  of the Eurydice, appears in the *Baily's Magazine* for this month :

'Twas on a bright and breezy day  
A noble ship came sailing home,  
Dashing from either bow the spray,
And ploughs up the milk white foam.

For the last time the gallant band,  
Close to "Old England on the lee,"  
Had said their prayers for those on land  
Who asked God's aid for those at sea.

The sun is sinking towards the west,  
Tinging with gold the belying sail;
The sailors take their Sabbath rest,  
And laugh and tell the oft-told tale.

The sister's joy, the mother's bliss,  
The dream of meeting of old friends,  
Of tight grasped hand, of lover's kiss,  
For all their hard-ships make amends.

No cheery-hearted coastguard fails  
To point the ship to those who stand  
Around– whose prayers are in the sails  
Which waft her towards the friendly strand.

No wonder that the captain thought  
With honest hope and pride of soul,
To bring the good ship, "smart and taut,"  
Like a swifr racehorse to the goal.

Mid life and hope the thick black clouds  
Snow-filled that put the ship from view;
The fierce tornado strikes her shrouds,  
She's gone ! with all her home-bound crew.

The blood-red sun comes brightly back  
And lightens up the evening sky,  
And  paints what *was* the vessel's track,  
As if in empty mockery

Alas ! for skill of human mind!  
He from whom good and evil come,
Who rides upon the stormy wind,  
Took the three hundred wanderers Home.

POETRY - WRECK OP THE EURYDICE.

WRITTEN ON A SICK BED

A sunny afternoon, so fair, so bright ;  
A Sabbath afternoon, so free from care!  
And those along the shore admire a sight  
Which stirs the heart of Britons everywhere.

A noble ship returning from the seas,  
A man of-war with sails all set and smart,  
So she may haply catch the slightest breeze  
To help her onward to the longed-for port.

And there on board the influence of the day  
Makes itself felt, and men have leisure given  
To rest, to read, to think, perchance to pray,  
And raise the soul awhile from earth to heaven.

Look at the group upon the headland there,  
Their eyes all dazed, their faces blanched with fear;  
They gasp for breath, and ask " Where is she now?  
Tis but a moment since that she was here.'

A blinding snow storm falling fast and thick,  
A sudden squall that comes from off the shore—  
A lurch, a cry, then orders short and quick ;  
Too late, too late— she sinks —is seen no more!

More than three hundred men now lie at rest  
Beneath those treacherous waves so calm and clear ;  
Three hundred of our bravest, bonniest, best;  
All England feels the blow and sheds a tear.

Not for the lost alone, but for the left;  
The widowed souls now weeping for their love;  
The children fatherless; the parents reft  
Of their dear boy, now ocean's treasure-trove.

Shall we not all contribute to their needs,  
And help these helpless ones, so sad and lorn?  
Let sympathy end not in words, but deeds!  
Remember 'tis for us their hearts are torn!

– *Liverpool Mercury. *

Poetry - THE CLOSE OF THE VOYAGE.

There sailed the ship Eurydice—  
On board three hundred men,  
With all her steady canvas spread,  
For British seas again.  
From far Bermuda's isles she sailed,  
That lie along the West,  
And left the realm of setting suns  
To seek the port of rest.

And now the Lizard's past, and they  
Descry the distant land  
Loom dark along the rugged line  
Of cloven rock and sand;  
There rise before their eager gaze  
Fair hamlets and rich towns,  
There stretch stern Cornwall's jagged cliffs,  
There Devon's gentle downs.

Tbe Sabbath morning rises blue  
Above the gloom of night,  
And on their lee they hail with joy  
The castled coast of Wight.  
Serene among its sombre mists,  
Like sea-beast in its lair ;  
And on the crowded deck there stands  
The happy crew at prayer.

No solemn warning from the sky  
Broke o'er their glad repose,  
As sweet upon the wintry air  
The sounds of worship rose.  
No voice from Nature's myriad tongues  
Foretold their danger near,  
Within the sight of British land  
They did not dream of fear.

But now the tempest fiend awoke,  
And smote the mighty ship ;  
And low upon the stormy deep,  
Her lofty topmasts dip ;  
As when through forests of the south  
The dread tornado flies,  
O'erthrown upon the shattered earth  
The stately cedar lies.

Through open ports the waters rush  
With swift and surging stream,  
And like a giant stricken down,  
She lies upon her beam.  
And while wild shrieks of anguish fade  
Into death's feeble gasp  
The engulfing billows clutch their prey  
In their relentless grasp.

Sad fate ! condole for Britain's loss;  
Her brave three hundred men  
Shall never tread her glorious soil  
Or battle-decks again.  
Amid her sorrow let her bow,  
And weep like Niobe  
While blighted hearts and homes lament  
The lost Eurydice.

Poetry. IN MEMORIAM.

Ho! merrily home with her gallant crew,  
The dear 0ld coast-line in full view,  
Up Channel under a press of sail  
She sped, careering before the gale.  
Taut and trim as a ship should be,  
For Spithead bound the Eurydice !

The church-bells chimed on the distant shore,  
And the manriners dreamt that toil was o'er;  
Of cheery greetings and loving smiles  
For the sun-burnt lads from the tropic isles;  
And all was sunshine, hope and glee  
Around and aboard the Eurydice.

A change in the sky ! A sudden squall !  
And the blinding sleet's bewildering fall !  
Down, down in a vortetx of foam and spray  
Three hundred souls have been swept away !  
Gone down in the doomed Eurydice–  
Parce, precamur, Domine !

The storm flies over; the sunlight streams;  
The teacherous bosom of ocean gleams;  
There is little in sky or sea to tell  
Of the terrible deed they plaaned so well.  
Only some timbers, floating free,  
Are left of the poor Eurydice !

Merciful Father ! this hour what tears  
Fall, and will fall through the weary years ?  
Fond friends bitterly, night and day,  
Mourning the dear ones gone for aye;  
Sadly raising the cry to Thee–
"O God, have pity on *all* at sea !"

Sad blow indeed ! VoYetl we'll think with pride  
Like British tars at their posts they died.  
And what nobler grave than his native deep  
Could the sailor choose for his long last sleep,  
Where the roar of the surf shall ever be  
The dirge of the Eurydice?

Poetry - H.M.S. "EURYDICE," MARCH 24, 1878.

"Eurydice," twice-told, ill-fated name,  
The fullest agony of grief to claim.  
A bride beloved upon her marriage day  
Snatched ruthlessly by death's stern hand away.  
Not her adoring lover's destined bliss  
Was nearer consummation than was this  
Two oceans passed, and close at home once more  
Gazed at in rapture from old England's shore,  
With all sails set, beneath a sunny sky,  
Wind and tide favouring. What bliss is nigh !  
Nay it is well-nigh grasped, that " Welcome Home,"  
When the proud ship plunged into the tomb,  
As on the beauty of her out-spread wings  
The fatal blast in frenzied fury springs,  
Without a warning all those noble, brave  
Young throbbing hearts are silenced 'neath the wave  
Without a warning o'er the calm bright sea,  
A message called them to eternity.  
Nor Orpheus' self for his Eurydice  
Knew the wide sorrow that felt for thee.  
How many lives what love as true and strong,  
Will to their close the grief for thee prolong ?  
If Orpheus-like we fain would search the deep  
For thy dear treasures that -within it sleep,  
No power of wealth or talent can attain  
To bring the warm life gushing back again ;  
'Twould be a cold and shadowy ghost alone  
That could not for lost love and hope atone.  
But oh ! begone, ye mystic shadows dim,  
Let holier, brighter faith now point to Him !  
Sleep, loved ones; "Sleep in Jesus;" may you rest  
Till " the sea yields her dead," then fully blest,  
May you, with Him, dwell through eternity  
In that good land where shall be no more sea,  
No tears, no partings, on that blissful shore,  
Where gallant ship shall pass by nevermore.

POETRY - THE EURYDICE.

The day was bright and fair day could be,  
The blue with many sail was dotted o’er;  
Yet rode an angry surge upon the sea.  
That dashed its unspent wrath and baffled roar  
Around the frigate as she neared the shore—  
The stout old ship Eurydice.

Her every sail was set, and cheerily  
The crew responded to the boatswain’s call.  
"Keep her before the wind awhile," said he;  
"We'll make the port before the evenfall.  
Stand by, my lads! for yonder comes squall—  
A gale may be."  

Below was heard the cheery voice of song,  
As kits were packed and hammocks were untied;  
The hearty laugh as the joke along.  
Or Jack described the beauties of his bride.  
And suddenly stopped short— as by the side  
Lurched the Eurydice.

Above, the sun was down, and thick the dark,  
Dense clouds were driven before the rising blast;  
And staggering 'neath a cloud of sail, the bark  
Tried to outspeed the sleet that hurried past;  
While ever and anon her trembling mast  
Dipped to the raging sea.

Then, rising, shook herself, as if to dare  
The winds and waters to their very worst;  
And gallant hearts and true were there  
To brave the dangers that the good ship durst;  
But fell, and stern adown the tempest burst,  
And smote Eurydice.

No timid shriek was heard above the roar;  
Captain and crew, each man was at his post;  
No panic as the stout old ship heeled o’er.  
And wisdom and good heart were needed most;  
No craven heart, I ween, when all was lost,  
And ’neath the waves sank she.

Then in the deadly gloom a moment white  
Fluttered her dripping canvas the sky.  
Like a pale ghost to greet the gathering night—  
The silent hail of those about to die.  
Into the deep without groan or cry  
Vanished Eurydice.

Whose was the blame? Not theirs who fought with Death  
That battle stiff and stern upon the deep  
Unconquered; they but yielded up their breath ;  
And still within their ocean-home they sleep.  
While many a British heart their fame will keep  
Who fought and died at sea.

Poetry - SORROW ON THE SEA.

"There is sorrow on the sea—it cannot be quiet"— Jer. xlix. 23.

The following poem, written by the late Captain M. A. S. Hare, of the Eurydice, in a friend's album some years since, will be read with mournful interest:–

I stood on the shore of the beautiful sea,  
As the billows were roaming wild and free;  
Onward they came with unfailing force,  
Then backward turned in their restless course;  
Ever and ever sound their roar,  
Foaming and dashing against the shore;  
Ever and ever they rose and fell,  
With heaving and sighing and mighty swell ;  
And deep seemed calling aloud to deep,  
Lest the murmuring waves should drop to sleep.  
In Summer and Winter, by night and by day,  
Thro' cloud and sunshine holding their way ;  
Oh ! when shall the ocean's troubled breast  
Calmly and quietly sink into rest!  
Oh when shall the waves' wild murmuring cease,  
And the mighty waters be hushed to peace?

It cannot be quiet—it cannot rest ;  
There must be Bearing on ocean's breast :  
The tide must ebb, and the tide must flow,  
Whilst the changing seasons come and go.  
Still from the depths of that hidden store  
There are treasures teased up along the shore ;  
Tossed by the billows- then seized again—  
Carrieed away by the rushing main

Oh, strangely glorious and beautiful sea !  
Sounding forever mysteriously,  
Why are the billows still rolling on,  
With their wild and sad and musical tone?  
Why is there never repose for thee ?  
Why slumberest thou not, oh mighty sea?

Then the ocean's voice I seemed to hear, 
Mournfully, solemnly— sounding near,  
Like a wail sent up from the caves below, 
Fraught with dark memories of human woe.  
Telling of loved ones, buried there,  
Of the dying shriek and the dying prayer ;  
Telling of hearts still watching in vain  
For those who never shall come again :  
Of the widow's groans, the orphan's cry,  
And the mother's speeehless agony.  
Oh, no, the ocean can never rest  
With such secrets hidden within its breast.  
There is sorrow written upon the sea,  
And dark and stormy its waves must be ;  
It *cannot* be quiet, it *cannot* sleep.  
That dark, relentless, and stormy deep.

But a day will come, a blessed day,  
When earthly sorrow shall pass away ,  
When the hour of anguish shall turn to peace,  
And even the roar of the wares shall cease.  
Then out from its deepest and darkest bed  
Old Ocean shall render up her dead,  
And, freed from the weight of human woes,  
Shall unietly sink in her last repose.  
No sorrow shall ever be written then  
On the depths of the sea or the hearts of men,  
But heaven and earth renewed shall shine ,  
Still clothed in glory and light divine.  
Then where shall the billows of ocean be?  
*Gone !* for in heaven shall be "no more at sea !"  
'Tis a bright and beautiful thing of earth,  
That cannot share in the soul's "new birth ;"  
'Tis a life of murmur and tossing and spray,  
And at resting-time it must pass away.

But, oh thou glorious and beautiful sea,  
There is health and joy and blessing in thee  
Solemnly, sweetly, I hear thy voice,  
Bidding me weep mid yet rijoice—  
Weep for the loved ones buried beneath,
Rejoice in Him who has conquered death ;  
Weep for the sorrowing and tempest-tossed,  
Rejoice in him who has saved the lost ;  
Weep for the sin, the sorrow. and strife,  
And rejoice in the hope of eternal life.

Poetry -  THE RAISING OF THE EURYDICE.

Return from death ! -return Eurydice !  
Appear again — nor sojourn in the grave;  
A thousand hearts are bleeding now for thee,  
And Britain's self is mourning for the brave.

No lute melodious charms the cavern'd deep,  
To yield thee up, and life again restore  :  
With thee descending there for ever sleep  
Those lov'd and gallant hearts for evermore.

Nor yet shall fable unremember'd fall  
As thou returnuring seek'st again the sea.  
The voice of Memory, Orpheus like shall I call,  
And cry Eurydice! Eurydice!

From gallant life to death- one moment's space,  
A darken'd sun- a stroke of unseen wing,-  
As though in air, some mystic Spirit chase  
Had cross'd the world in wildest Wandering.

Down, down Eurydice- beneath the storm-  
To hopeful gale- with all thy canvas spread-  
Thou through the briny space did'st hide thy form,  
And now we seek thee in thy rocky bed.  

We seek thee now with love no fable knows,  
In cavern'd deeps- not Hades seen more drear,  
Nor Orpheus, sorrowing o'er his tender woes,  
Could mourn a fate more sad or more severe.  

We seek thee eagerly- and now the tears  
Are mov'd again that fond Affection shed;  
Lo ! to the light thy long-lost form appears,  
And seems to bear a message from the dead.

In vain ! thy silent formn is changed and sad;  
We must awhile thy memory forego,  
Nor even with thy name restor'd be glad,  
Whilst it retains a record of our woe.

Affection may not gaze upon thy wrack,—  
Grief leaves Old Time to count the tearful cost,  
For e'en like Orpheus, Memnory looking back  
Is deemed to blend thee with the lov'd and lost.

- Thomas SMITH
