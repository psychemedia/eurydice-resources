With the Eurydice eventually refloated, it was now time forher final voyage: being towed back to Portsmouth.

Once there, the last of the remaining bodies would be reomved, she would be dismantled, and her old timbers sold off.

THE EURYDICE FLOATED AND TOWED INTO PORTSMOUTH.

The Eurydice has at last been safely brought to the surface, the floating operations having been successfully accomplished on Sunday, and the vessel was towed into Portsmouth exactly twenty-three weeks after her homeward voyage was brought to so abrupt and sad a termination. The beach was always well thronged with promenaders on Sunday, and the usual morning attendance had just been augmented by hundreds of persons coming from church. Consequently, the Beach and Piers were soon lined with spectators who evinced the utmost curiosity and interest in the proceedings. As the ships approached the harbour the "Pilot Jack" was run up at the Semaphore Tower in the dockyard. This flag is always exhibited when a ship of the navy is either entering or leaving harbour, so that the Eurydice, notwithstanding her battered and dismantled condition, is still regarded as a ship in commission, although but two of her crew remain to be paid off. As the ships passed the various vessels in the harbour the decks were lined with officers and men, many of whom had lost both relatives and friends in the foundering of the ship which had now been recovered from the deep. Amongst the spectators on board the flagship, Duke of Wellington, were Cuddiford and Fletcher, the two survivors, who are waiting the result of the court-martial, the decision of which will be read to-morrow. The vessels continued to the extreme end of the harbour, beyond the north corner of the dockyard, and the Eurydice was then safely berthed alongside the Laurel hulk. The steam tugs then withdrew, a party being left on board to take charge, together with two of Merryweather's powerful steam engines. which were to be used in continuing the work of pumping. Only one, however, was needed to keep the water under, for it was found that the Eurydice only leaked to the extent of three inches in half an hour. The hull of the Eurydice presents a sadly different appearance from what she did on the day she flundered. The smart white hull, chequered with the black ports, has all disappeared, and in their place is a hull denuded of nearly all its paint, scratched and splintered in all directions, whilst numerous planks nailed on to the sides for the purpose of repairing several of the leaks are not calculated to add to her smartness. One more body was discovered on the lower deck, making altogether 130 recovered from the wreck. The entire centre of the upper deck is washed away through the violence of the waves during the tinm the wreck lay in Sandown Bay. The planks placed crosswise form a means of communication from one part of the upper deck to the other. On going below a scene of chaotic confusion presented itself. Most of the gear has been removed from the main deck, and many of the cabins knocked away; but the deck is still littered with the broken spars and rigging. It is upon the lower deck that the scene is most chaotic; the deck is littered with *debris* from end to end, and the whole is covered with a muddy slime several inches deep. Officers' chests, men's clothes, bags, beer barrels, bird cages, pickle bottles, surgical cases and instruments lie upon the deck in a heterogeneous mass. Locomotion between decks, in consequence of the quantity of mud which has been washed in, was extremely difficult. On the lower deck is situated the bread room, from which a most intolerable stench proceeded from the decomposed bread and other provisions, notwithstanding the fact tht the decks are continually washed with carbolic acid. The captain's cabin has been entirely removed. On the lower deck are several cells, in one of which a prisoner was found minus his head. The poor fellow was not chained; but another one on the lower deck was. The irons have been found near the mainmast, but no body. The holds it is at present impossible to get down into, owing to the fact that all the moveable gear near the spot has rolled into them and choked them up. In making room for the suction pipes to go down the lumber into the hold the divers came across a body jammed in, and supposed to be that of the bread room boy. Several articles of uniform and clothing were scattered atout the lower deck, amongst which is a lieutenamt's undress uniform coat. The coart-martial assembled to inquire into the cause of the loss of the Eurydice delivered their finding on Monday. They were of opinion that the ship foundered in a sudden and exceptionally dense snowstorm on March 24, by pressure of wind on the sails, and that the upper half-ports being justifiably open, considering the state of the previous wind and weather, naturally conduced to the catastrophe. No one is to blame, the captain being frequently on deck, and carrying on duty before and at the time the squall struck her. The court is further of opinion that the stability of the ship was maintained after her adaptation as a training ship, and that after the alterations in May, 1877, she was in every respect an efficient ship. They fully acquit the two survivors, Cuddiford and Fletcher. A report as to whether the Eurydice is to be repaired has not yet been presented, but there is very little doubt that the wreck, as soon as it has been cleared, will be taken into dock and broken up. The hull is in a most dilapidated condition, and altogether so strained that it would probably cost more money to place the Eurydice in sea-going trim than the ship would be actually worth. The opinion that she will be broken up is strengthened by the fact that many vessels in far better condition which have been broken up.

THE EURYDICE TAKEN TO PORTSMOUTH.

About noon on Sunday persons on Ryde Pier and the Esplanade observed a small fleet of tugs under steam in the offing towards Sea View, and it was soon asserted that the Eurydice was being towed into Portsmouth Harbour, and a further scrutiny through telescopes continued the rumour, that at last the unfortunate ship was onde more fairly afloat, although it was difficult to believe that after the storms on Thursday night and Friday morning, the work of pumping out could have been effected. On Saturday the divers were busily engaged in making good the serious damage to the starboard and bilge, in default of doing which pumping out would have simply been impossible. From the commencement of their arduous task, the submarine workmen have shown a devotion to duty which has elicited the warm approval of the chief officers concerned. They worked with a persistent energy for hour after hour in repairing the bilge, from which, by contact with the bottom in the different lifts, three strokes of planking had been torn away for a distance of between forty and fifty feet, and nightfall had set in before they reported that the damage had been well migh made good. Canvas was stretched and fastened over the injured bilge, and covered with battens.

At five o'clock on Sunday morning the divers, seven in number, gave the finishing touches to their work, and, an hour later, Admiral Foley, Mr. J. Robinson, Chief Constructor at Portsmouth, Captain Batt, Mater Attendant at Chatham, Lieutenants Wonnam and Moss, and J. C. Froyne, the Second Constructor at Portsmouth, with others, were on the spot, and preparations were made for pumping the wreck. Jenkins, a shipwright diver from Sheerness, in cutting a large scuttle hole into the lower deck, in order to carry down a suction pipe, discovered the body of a seaman in a store room, which was removed and taken into harbour for interment. At about seven o'clock the pumping was commenced, the Sampson and Grinder Government tugs setting to work with their steam pumps on the port, and the Manly and Malta — also Govenment tugs — on the starboard side. The pumping was continued for about four hours, and as the water in her was gradually lessened it was seen the divers had effectually stopped the serious leak on the starboard bilge, and that there was every probability that the wreck would be got into harbour. About half-past eleven the hull began to move, and the officers and men on the different craft gave three hearty cheers, while just afterwards an ensign was once more hoisted on board the Eurydice. Admiral Foley and other officials, with Mr. J. S. Harding, senior Admiralty pilot and Assistant Queen's Harbourmaster at Portsmouth, who piloted her into harbour, went on board, and shortly before noon she was on her way to Portsmouth harbour, a distance of about six miles. First came the Camel tug, towing five divers' boats, followed by the Grinder, which had the mastless wreck in tow, the latter having the Sampson and Manly lashed to her port side, and the Malta to her starboard. As the flotilla slowly approached Portsmouth some thousands of spectators flocked to the piers, beach, and lined the ramparts. The slow progress arose from the tide being against the craft until the spit was reached, after which they came into harbour on the flood tide, the help thus obtained enabling the tugs to proceed under easy steam. The weather was fine, with light wind and cloudy sky. By two o'clock the Eurydice had been safely secured alongside the Laurel, in Porchester Lake, and the Swan, with two steam fire engines, was placed alongside her, to resume pumping should it be found necessary. During the afternoon the waterman reaped a harvest, and the vicinity of the wreck was thickly thronged with boats crowded with people anxious to get a sight of the wreck, which presented a very dilapidated appearance. The battered weather-beaten hull was all that the public were allowed to see on Sunday. Thu work of clearing the lower deck and of fumigating will probably be commenced prior to the wreck being placed in dock.

The Eurydice has at length been raised and safely towed into Portchester Creek. How anxiously have the public, watched the proceedings of floating and pumping out of what six months ago was a stately vessel in full sailing trim, but now a battered hull. A good sized volume has been written and published about the disaster of March 24th, 1878, but how many volumes would it require to recount the heart-anguish caused by the upsetting of a single ship? How many homes have been desolated by the loss of loved ones just entering upon the active duties of life! How much must for ever remain unwritten on the exact fate of the bodies of the hundreds who perished on that fatal Sunday afternoon. Although the good ship foundered so near to land, not more than a moiety of the bodies have been recovered, and many of these were past all identification. There must be many nameless if not tombless graves, and who shall calculate the amount of suspense and eager expectation of the many fathers, mothers, and other relatives throughout the past, to them, dreary five months, as now and again bodies were washed ashore or picked up from the wreck. Not that there could possibly be any hope of any being restored to life; but the hope that at least there would be the melancholy satisfaction of knowing where the bodies of the loved ones were. Had the Eurydice gone down far out at sea there would have been at least some certainty that the forms of the lost ones could never again be seen by their sorrowing friends ; but within a few cable lengths of the shore the case was different. Again, how few have realised, to any appreciable extent, the fact that the workers at the wreck have had to carry on their labours in the presence, it might be, of some hundreds of corpses. Doubtless thousands have visited the vicinity of the wreck, and many expressions of sympathy have found place in the remarks of the spectators; but how many of the vast number who have heard of, read of or witnessed the catastrophe have been able to estimate the unpleasantness of the work of raising a ship in the hull of which might be entombed hundreds of human beings. It is well perhaps, that people cannot, even in imagination. enter minutely into the details of such things, and it is a merciful arrangement of Providence that a veil is drawn over many of the more painful incidents in connection with such calamities. There is at least one redeeming and consolatory feature in connection with the loss of the Eurydice, in the fact that there has been a general acquittal of blame on the part of the Captain or any one engaged in sailing the ship. The Court-Martial was concluded on Saturday; on Cuddiford, one of the survivors, being asked if be wished to add anything to the evidence he had given, replied in the following noble testimony to the ability and worth of the lamented Captain of the Eurydice :— "I should like to be allowed to say before this court-martial is concluded how much we all loved and respected our noble captain. We had unbounded confidence in him, knowing that as a sailor he was surpassed by none, and I am sure he had the love and respect of every officer and man in the ship, for he studied their comfort and happiness in all respects. We were proud of our captain, we were proud of our officers, and proud of our ship, looking upon her us admirably adapted for the service in which she was employed." The other survivor, Sydney Fletcher, entirely confirmed this testimony.

VISIT TO THE EURYDICE.

The Eurydice, laid up alongside the old hulk Laurel in Porchester Creek, a continuation of Portsmouth Harbour, continues to be the centre of attraction. The wreck, so recently recovered from the deep is, however, zealously guarded by a detachment of marines until the work of clearing out the wreck has been finished. Through the courtesy of Admiral Foley, however, the Central News correspondent was enabled to make as examination of the whole of the ship yesterday afternoon. The entire centre of the upper deck is washed away through the violence of the waves during the time the wreck lay in Sandown Bay. The planks placed crosswise form a means of communication from one part of the upper deck to the other. On going below a scene of confusion presented itself. Most of the gear has been removed from the main deck, and many of the cabin knocked away, but the deck is still littered with the broken spurs and rigging. It is upon the lower deck that the scene is most chaotic. The deck is littered with *debris* from end to end, and the whole covered with a muddy slime several inches deep. Officers chests, men's clothes, bags, beer barrels, bird cages, pickle bottles, surgical cases and instruments which have fallen from the adjacent dispensary, lie upon the deck a heterogeneous and confused mass. Locomotion between decks in consequence of the quantity of mud which has been washed in was extremely difficult. The mainmast, the lower part of which still remains in the ship, was hoisted up out of the vessel, a distance of nearly six feet, by the bumping action to to which the vessel was subjected. The starboard side of the lower deck has also been considerably lifted out owing to the action of the sea. Right aft on the lower deck is situated the bread room, from which a most intolerable stench proceeded from the decomposed bread and other provisions, notwithstanding the fact that the Weeks are continually washed with carbolic acid. The captain's cabin has been entirely removed. On the lower deck are several cells, in one of which a prisoner was found, *minus* his head. The poor fellow was not chained, but another one, at large on the lower deck, was. The irons have been found near the mainmast, but no body. The holds are at present impossible to get down into owing to the fact that all the movable gear near the spot has rolled into them and choked them up. In making room for the suction pipes to go down between the lumber into the hold, the divers came across a body jammed in, and supposed to be that of the breadroom boy. Several articles of uniform clothing were scattered about the lower deck, amongst which is a lieutenant's undress uniform coat. Yesterday the working party came across a skull, but no more bodies. In case the vessel should meet with any untoward accident, anchors have been laid out from her, so that, in case the necessity should arise, she can be immediately hauled up on to the mud. One of the steam engines, got to work periodically, continues to be sufficient to keep the water under. As soon as poesible the work of clearing the ship — a labour of considerable magnitude—will be concluded, and the vessel fumigated and brought into port; but this is not likely to take place for at least a fortnight.

THE EURYDICE IN PORT.

The hull of the Eurydice formally passed into the hands of the Commander-in-Chief on Monday, and steps were at once taken to clean and sweeten her by means of carbolic acid and other disinfectants. Lieut. Izat and a party from the Duke of Wellington are engaged in clearing out the vessel, private baggage being removed before the stores of the ship, and two dockyard divers, Hicks and Macculloch, are told off to attend the ship night and day in case their services may be wanted at any time, but as the percolation of water in to the hold does not exceed one foot per hour, one of the Merryweather fire-engines suffices to pump out three hours' leakage in half an hour. As the ship becomes embedded in the harbour mud at every fall of the tide, the seams of the hull are closing up and the leakage is becoming gradually less. On Tuesday the skeleton of the gunner was found in his cabin, and removed to Haslar Hospital for interment. When the ship has been thoroughly cleaned she will be taken into the deep dock and broken up.

THE LAST OF THE EURYDICE.

The last of the Eurydice was seen yesterday, when the old timbers of the ship were sold at Portsmouth Dockyard by public auction. An order from the Admiralty prohibited the remnants of the ship being sold as relicts of the Eurydice, so the lots were simply sold as old timber. The prices were about the ordinary, as the interest in the wreck has by this time altogether subsided.
