At the start of 19th century, in the early 1800s, surveyors stood ere and established a triangulation point: it acted as the southernmost point of a base meridian line running north - this line was rather more central to the greenwich meridian line, longitude 0, which defines Greenwich Mean Time, GMT, which sets a point of reference for timezones all round the world.

The point on Shanklin Down, the Dunnose triangulation point, takes its name from Dunnose point, the rounded corner on the south east edge of the diamond shaped island. Walk down from the downs, and a steep rocky smugglers' path known as the Devil's chimney takes you down to the beach. Surely, there are overtones that someehere thereabouts there is perhaps a gateway to the underworld, to the land of the dead, to hell.

Round to the south, Monks Bay, Bonchurch, Horseshoe Bay and Ventnor, then down to the southernmost tip of the island and the lighthouse at St Catherine's point. Venture further west, past Blackgang Chine and you look out over Chale bay Atherfield Ledge, site of many shipwrecks over the years, then on to Freshwater and the Needles and the coloured sands of Alum Bay. Round to the north, Luccombe and Shanklin and the calm of Sandown Bay.

Still to this day, if you go to the more rural parts of the island, you can look up to the heavens on a dark night ans witness them in all their glory. These are still "dark skies". And it was skies such as this that marniners used to naviagte the seas by, using other forms of geometry.

And to navigate the heavens themselves, the sailors used star maps based on stories, based on recognising the named constellations we still recognise today, as well as th movement of the wandering stars, the planets.

In the UK, we tend to know the stories of the constellations as classical myths of Rome and Greece. And just as those stories helped mariners navigate the sea, those myths provide maps of another sort: maps that helped you understand, or at least explain in a more or less predictive way, the turning of the seasons, why things happened the way they did, or stories that perhaps helped you find a way through human life, through the maze of emotions and feelings we all must navigate.

One such tale is the story of Eurydice, and her husband Orpheus.

Now some say that names carry with them an echo of their former selves - indeed, the very word echo brings to mind the sorrowful tale of that cursed mountain nymph, but that is a story for another day. And so, perhaps it was unfortunate, or perhaps it was unwise, that H.M.S. Eurydice should have been so named.
