<p>Alhtough the story of the Eurydice brought us to the Island of 1878, what of the Island a few years afterwards, and in particular, the developments at Bembridge and St Helens over that short period of time?</p>
<section id="brading-harbour-reclaimed">
<h2>Brading Harbour, Reclaimed<a class="headerlink" href="#brading-harbour-reclaimed" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>By the end of June, 1879, the first indication that the improved works were complete, and the land was reclaimed once more, were being announced.</p>
<div class="note dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The Reclamation of Brading Harbour. - Saturday, June 28th, 1879</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790628/007/0005">Isle of Wight Observer</a>, 1879-06-28, p. 5</p>
<p>Just as we are going to press, we learn from the contractor, Mr. Frederick Seymour, that the work of reclaiming Brading Harbour, which has been carried on for the last two or three years, has at last terminated successfully, and an immense tract of what we hope will be ere long arable land added to the island. Ihe contractors have had many difficulties to contend with, but it was only to be expected that with all the modern appliances at his command, Mr. Seymour would be as successful as his great predecessor in the same work two centuries ago— Sir Hugh Middleton.</p>
</div>
<p>The costs of the project, to date, were estimated at around £80,000, in exchange for 700 acres of reclaimed land.</p>
<div class="note dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">BRADING, July 9. - Wednesday, July 9th, 1879</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000495/18790709/028/0004">Hampshire Advertiser</a>, 1879-07-09, p. 4</p>
<p>Brading Haven Reclamation Scheme.— During the few years the works in connection with the above scheme have been in progress, there have not been wanting those ready to express a doubt as to Mr. Seymour or anyone else having the power of bringing such a work to a successful termination. In the annals of engineering, however, there is no such word as ” fail,” and when we look at the vast works carried out by men like Lesseps, Stephenson, Brunell, and many others, there is no need for doubt as to the ultimate success of the reclamation of Brading harbour. The idea of reclaiming the extensive mudflats, which for years hare only been haunted by the ” winkle picker,” originated with Mr. E J. H. Saunders, C.E., who succeeded in forming a company to provide the requisite capital, and this company included in its programme not merely the reclamation of the harbour, but the construction of a railway to the pretty little village of Bembridge, hitherto cut off from free communication with other parts of the Island. That the capital required was no trifle may be gathered from the fact that already £80,000 have been expended, but no doubt in a few years the company will find the seven hundred acres of land they have now succeeded in preventing the sea from covering very remunerative. At the head of the harbour is a tract of marshy land which at one time was evidently submerged and reclaimed by means of an embankment. This is said to be one of the best bits of grazing ground in the Island ; the salt which still remains in the ground exactly suits the cattle, who thrive on it extremely well, and we see no reason why the land now reclaimed should not be in a few years equally suitable for grazing purposes. The railway to Bembridge also will open up one of the most lovely, though hitherto neglected, spots in the Island. A few years will probably convert this little village into a town, and then the company who have displayed so much enterprise will receive a fitting reward.</p>

<p>The Reclamation of  Haven.— After many ominous shakes of the head from people residing in the locality of St. Helen’s, there can be no doubt that Mr. Seymour has successfully completed the task of keeping back the water from the extensive mud flats which for years have furnished such capital spots for the ” winkler ” and the fowler. The idea of reclaiming the extensive tract of submerged land called  Haven, originated with Mr. R J. H. Saunders, C.E., who succeeded in forming a company to provide the requisite capital. No trifling amount was required, for already the amount expended has reached the formidable sum of £80, 000. For this investment the company have some 700 acres of land, and although at present this does not look very promising, there can be little doubt that, in a few years time, there will be a good return from it. At the top of the harbour are what are known as the marshes, a tract of low land which has evidently been at some period reclaimed from the sea by an embankment, and this is stated to be one of the best pieces of grazing land in the Wight. The farmers say that it fattens beasts extremely well, and some consider this is owing to the salt which still remains in the land. There is every hope, therefore, that in a few years’ time the land now reclaimed will be equally good. But the reclamation of the harbour was by no means the whole of the company’s scheme. They are now constructing a railway to St. Helen’s and Bembridge, and a large portion of the embarking work will also serve to carry the railway. Bembridge is at present a locality very little visited, owing to the difficulty and trouble of reaching it. Horses and carriages have had to go a long way round to get to it. and the pedestrian from Ryde could only shorten the route by crossing a ferry at St. Helen’s. Nevertheless, Bembridge is one of the prettiest little places in the Island, and very healthy. Already a number of gentry have settled there, and when it is connected with the other parts of the Island by rail, it will probably soon arrive at the dignity of a town, and the company, who have shown so much enterprise, will reap a rich reward.</p>

<p>Could old Sir Hugh Middleton re-visit this earth and again cast his eyes over the watery expanse that lays beyond “ye ancient borough of Bradinge,” he would find the desire of his heart accomplished. For two years the navvy has been toiling away St. Helens and Bembridge ; and strong and able workmen under the able direction of Mr. Frederick Seymour have devoted their minds and bodies to one object—to reclaim Brading Haven from the sea. On Thursday last that work was accomplished and over eight hundred acres of what will in the course of a few years be probably fine pasture land were reclaimed from the sea. This land will be the property of the Brading Haven Reclamation Company ; and imagine that its value will more than equal the cost the reclamation. We cordially congratulate Mr Frederick Seymour in having brought so arduous an undertaking to successful termination. The name this gentleman will be handed down to posterity as the one who carried out the mightiest engineering work ever done in this island. Not merely has this gentleman reclaimed 800 acres of land, but the inhabitants of Bembridge and St. Helens have been greatly benefitted by his enterprise in other matters; and we hope that he will meet with substantial recompense for the great work he has accomplished. The Isle Wight is larger by over 800 acres than it was when we went to press last week.— <em>Ryde Newspaper.</em> [Mr. F. Seymour has many friends in Jersey].</p>

<p>Reclamation of Brading Harbour.— A correspondent of the Building News writes to say that the arduous work of reclaiming Brading Harbour, which has been carried on with unremitting diligence during the last two or three years, has now terminated successfully, and an immense tract of what we hope will be ere long arable land added to the Island. Mr. Saunders has had many difficulties to contend with ; but it was only to be expected that, with all modern appliances at his command. he would at least be as successful as his great predecessor in the same work two centuries ago, Sir Hugh Myddelton, of New River fame.</p>
<p>Novel Cricket Match.— On Saturday last a cricket match was played between members of the Brading Cricket Club and a team selected from the men employed by Mr. Seymour, the contractor, who has carried out the reclamation works, at Brading Harbour. The match was less remarkable as a display of skill, than from the fact that it was played upon ground till recently covered by the sea, and hardly yet firm enough to enable a good match to be played. The Brading team won easily, but a considerable number of persons assembled, more curious it appeared as to the firmness of the ground than the ability of the cricketers.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">SIR HUGH MIDDLETON’S ATTEMPT TO ENCLOSE BRADING HAVEN, AS TOLD IN THE OGLANDER MEMOIRS. - Saturday, May 9th, 1896</p>

<p>The operations of the ‘Transit Company,’ give the promise of a great boon to the Isle of Wight, and will, when carried out, make Brading Haven one of the busiest harbours in this Island. Under these circumstances the following extract from the manuscript memoirs of Sir John Oglander may be of interest.</p>
<p>‘Brading Haven was begged by one Gibb, a great favourite and groom of the bed-chamber to King James the First. The Haven was challenged by the gentlemen of the island whose land joined to it. King James was very earnest in the suit against them, both because it concerned his old servant, as also that it might be a leading case to the fens in Lincolnshire. After the verdict went in the Exchequer against the gentlemen. Sir Beavis Thelwell, a page of the bed-chamber to King James, also gave Gibb £2,000 for his grant. One Sir Hugh Middleton came in a sharer with Sir Beavis Thelwell, and by the help of Dutchmen undertook the enclosing of it. They began to inn the haven Dec. 10, 1620. Sir Beavis after the enclosure enjoyed it eight years, bestowed much money in building a barn, house, mills, and many other devices, until March 8, 1630, that the sea broke in again. The nature of the ground after it was in was not answerable to what was expected ; for almost a moiety of it next the sea was a light running sand little worth ; the best of it was down at the farthest end next Brading. I count that there were 200 acres that might be worth 6s. and 8d. per acre, and the rest 2s. and 6d. ; the total of the haven was 700 acres. Sir Hugh Middleton, before he
sold his share, tried all experiments, sowing wheat, barley, oats, cabbage, and onion seeds, and last of all, rape seed, which proved the best, but all the rest came to nothing. The great inconvenience was that the sea brought in so much sand, and oaze, and sea-weed, that choaked up the passage where the fresh should go out, insomuch that I am of opinion, if the sea had not broke in Sir Beavis would hardly have kept it, for there would have been no current for the fresh to go out, for the east tide brought so much sand in that the fresh was not of force to scour it away, so that in time it must have lain to the sea, or the fresh would have drowned the whole
country ; therefore, in my opinion, it is not good meddling with the haven. The cause of its being lost again to the sea was by reason of a wet time when the haven was full of fresh water, and then at a high spring-tide both the waters met underneath, which caused a breach to ensue. I would wish no friend of mine to have a hand in the second inning of it. It cost at the first taking of it in £4,000, afterwards in building the barn, dwelling-house, water-mill, with trenching and quick-setting and making the partitions not less than £1,000 more; so that it stood then in the total (purchasing the grant and all) full to £7,000. All the encouragement I can give any that will venture to inn it a second time is that it will yield in some seven or eight years £150 per annum, but you must never expect much more. It will improve the country for health, but the danger is in bringing in beach, weeds, and sand, that will stop the current next the sea, — and consequently the passage of the fresh water. J.O.’</p>
<p>The ‘one Sir Hugh Middleton’ of this extract (whose grandson and namesake married Dorothy, grand-daughter of Sir John Oglander) was the ‘citizen and goldsmith,’ who in 1606 offered to bring to London a sufficient supply of pure water at his own cost. His offer was accepted, and having fixed on the Chadwell and Amwell springs near Ware in Hertfordshire as the sources out of which his New River was to be formed, he commenced in 1608 a work which,considering the imperfect mechanical agencies of those times, was a wonderful effort of engineering skill. In 1622 Middleton was created a baronet (the king by special warrantexcusing him from the usual payment of the fee, £1,095) for three reasons which are assigned in a paper in the Harleian Collection in the British Museum signed ‘ W. Camden, Clarenceux.’</p>
<p>The second of these is for gaining a very great and spacious quantity of land in Brading Haven, in the Isle of Wight, out of the bowelles of the sea ; and with banks
and piles, and most strange and defensible and chargeable mountains, fortifying same against the violence and fury of the waves.’</p>
<p>In 1699 another scheme was suggested for what Sir John Oglander calls the ‘inning’ of Brading Haven. This good ‘old-fashioned word inning,’ which, though found in Chaucer, seems to have died out except in the cricket-field, might well be revived. The abstract of this scheme, an ‘estimate of the charge of taking in, draining, and securing the Haven of Brading,’ at the cost of £4,170, signed by Heny. Sher, Surveyor, will be found in Appendix No. lxxxiv. in Worsley’s History. The Appendix lxxxiii, is the copy of the award made to Sir John de Weston, who had claimed the right of fishing in Brading Haven, and had submitted it to arbitration in the sixth year of Edward II. Worsley (Hist. I. W. p. 195) has also mentioned some earlier attempts to recover this large piece of land from the sea, a part of it having been taken in by Sir William Russell, Warden of the Isle of Wight in the reign of Edward I.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorne, in his excellent description of the Isle of Wight (The Land we Live in, vol. ii. p. 262), has told the ancient legend of the Haven : Now in former days neither lake nor swamp existed here, but instead, a green valley. Through this fertile land flowed the narrow river, upon the banks of which stood the large and splendid castle, whose owner was the lord of all these parts. A harsh and violent ma  he was, and drove his only son away from his home. The castle was abandoned after the death of the old man to the reptile and the bat, but the neighbours spoke of a prediction, the tenor of which, repeated in their rude rhyme, was that when the heir should be found, he should by means of twelve milk-white oxen recover the family treasure which had been hidden by the last lord. Generations passed away, and it seemed an idle tale, when a rough, soldier-like looking man came to the Island and gave out that he was the descendant of the banished son, who had died in foreign parts. From an old woman who had taken up her abode in the vaults of the castle, and who was suspected by the country people to be a witch, he learnt the terms of the prophecy, and by her aid discovered the well in which the treasure was hid. Long time elapsed before he could find the twelve milk-white oxen. When found at last, on the very night when all was in readiness, one of the oxen died. Maddened by disappointment, the claimant seized the nearest ox, heedless of its colour, but in mockery caused a white sheet to be sewn around it. Strong ropes were fastened to the bullocks, and the chest of hidden treasure rose slowly from its hiding-place. The man had already placed his hand upon it, when shouts of fiendish laughter rose from below, and at the same time the rope which was attached to the sheeted bullock snapped, and the chest was plunged back to the bottom of the well. Instantly the water began to rise till it flowed over the top of the well. The sky darkened, a fierce storm broke forth; the castle walls tottered and fell in the fury of the elements, the distant sea rolled over its ancient boundary, and the very site of the castle was invisible under the broad sheet of water.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that success may attend the plan of the Isle of Wight Marine Transit Company m their endeavour to connect the railways of the mainland with those of the Island. The water transit has always been one of the difficulties with which the Isle of Wight has had to contend but with this new system of conveying railway traffic, there is every reason for thinking that the trade, and consequent prosperity, of our island may make considerable advances.</p>
<p>If the old Court Leet of Brading is to disappear, there seems to be that the ‘ Towne of every prospect Kyng’s Bradynge,’ which was once of sufficient importance to return
a representative to Parliament, will enter upon a renewed career of bustling life and activity, and take its place with the bright new towns which have sprung up around it.</p>

<p>rks its way to the sea. But at high-tide it seems a handsome lake of 800 acres area. At such a time it is indeed a very beautiful object. From the mouth of the harbour you see a really noble lake embayed between hills of moderate elevation, which are covered pretty thickly with trees, in many places down to thevery edge of the water ; along the banks and on the sides of the hills are scattered many neat houses, and a church or two, and the head of the lake is surrounded by a lofty range of downs, whilst the surface, itself of a deep azure hue, glitters with numerous glancing sails, and is alive with hundreds of silver-winged seagulls. To one who has not seen, or can forget, a lake among the mountains, with the wondrous aerial fantasies which play about the lofty peaks that recede, ridge behind ridge, into the far distant ether, this will, if seen under favourable aspects, appear of almost unsurpassable beauty ; to every one it must appear very beautiful. An hour or two should be devoted to a sail upon it. The views from the surface are very varied ; those looking northwards derive much beauty from the way in which the sea, with its ships, and the distant shore, mingle with the lake. The view from the head of the harbour is, especially at sunset, eminently picturesque and striking.</p>
<p>There was a time when neither lake nor swamp existed here ; but instead was a green and fertile valley. Through the midst of it flowed the narrow river, upon the banks of which stood a large and magnificent castle, whose owners were the lords of all these parts. Rich were they and proud, as well as powerful ; but their wealth was ill-gained, and their power ill-exercised. From their towers they watched the adjacent sea ; and merciless was the treatment of the ship they could by force or stratagem obtain possession of. Often as the walls of the castle witnessed scenes of splendid revelry, they as often, it was rumoured, beheld deeds of fearful wrong. But at last the long course of prosperity was followed by a terrible reverse. In rash adventures and domestic feuds the once numerous family had dwindled down, till the old chief was left with an only son. A harsh and violent man he was ; and hard was it for any one to endure the fierce explosions of his anger, which seemed to increase in violence with his years. In one of these fits he drove his son from him with fearful denunciations. The old man died soon after; the son, it was reported, found an early and inglorious grave in a foreign land. The castle was abandoned to the reptile and the bat : a curse seemed to hang over the very walls ; even the dank ivy shrank from them. Ruin wandered undisturbed through the lonely rooms, and over the mouldering turrets. Wild and unholy sounds scared the heed- less rustics who ventured near after nightfall.</p>
<p>But by degrees it was whispered that the mysterious beings who haunted the deserted mansion had been heard to utter a strange prediction, the tenor of which, as repeated in uncouth rhyme, was, that when the heir should be found, he should by means of twelve milk- white oxen, recover the family treasure, which had been hidden by the last lord. Generations had passed away, and the story had come to be looked upon as an idle fiction, when a rough soldier-like man came to the island, and gave out that he was the descendant of the banished son. From an ancient crone, who, in order to escape the hands of the peasantry, who suspected her of intercourse with Satan, had taken up her abode in one of the vaults of the castle, he learned the terms of the prophecy, and by her aid discovered the well in which the treasure was concealed. Long and anxiously did he search before he could find the twelve milk-white oxen : he succeeded at last, and by help of the hag prepared for the adventure ; but on the very night when all was in readiness, one of the oxen died of some sudden malady. In vain did his companion entreat him to postpone the trial, urging that if the charm were broken the treasure would be irretrievably lost. Maddened by disappointment, he swore that he would have the gold, in spite of all the fiends who guarded it; and dared them to prevent him. He hastily seized the nearest ox he could find, heedless of its colour ; but, in mockery, caused a white sheet to be sewn around it. Strong ropes were attached to the bullocks, and the chest rose slowly, but apparently without difficulty from its hiding-place. It rose steadily to the very brink, and the bold man had already placed his hand upon it, when loud sounds as of laughter were heard rising from below ; and at the same moment, the rope which was attached to the sheeted bullock, snapped, and the chest fell back with a heavy plunge to the bottom of the well. Instantly the water began to rise till it flowed over the top in a thick black stream. And now the sky darkened ; a fierce storm burst forth ; the castle walls shook and fell in the fierce contention ; the distant sea rolled over its ancient boundary, and soon the very site of the castle was invisible under the broad sheet of water.</p>
<p>The lake was regarded as a forbidden spot. No fisherman cast his net in it ; the mariner, as he sailed along the adjoining channel, kept as far as possible from its entrance, lest he should be caught by the sudden flaws of wind, or the more vexatious calms that often baffled the skill of those who were driven within the enchanted bounds : while at night a flickering pale blue flame was often seen playing over the surface, — a sure sign of the revelry of elfin wights. So ages wore away, till after saints and monks were driven out of the land, and it seemed as if the evil spirits had departed with them ; the faith in these old tales wore out, and they were, by grave men even, said to be inventions. Then the skilful doings of Hugh Middleton, who had brought a New River to London, recovered much fenny land, and accomplished many other wondrous feats, suggested the project of regaining this land from the sea, and turning it to profitable account. Permission was readily obtained from the king to make the effort, and Middleton undertook the task. He procured workmen from Holland, who were accustomed to construct all kinds of marine embankments, and used his own best skill ; and he succeeded ” in gaining a very great and spacious quantity of land from the bowelles of the sea ; and with banks and piles, and most strange defensible and chargeable machines, for- tifying the same against the violence and fury of the waves,” as is fully set forth in the patent of baronetcy granted by the king to Sir Hugh in consideration of this and other worthy services.</p>
<p>Those who had laughed at the tale, and at the prediction which accompanied it, that the fairy sprites would never more yield the land they bad seized, now laughed the more, seeing, that the land was reclaimed.</p>
<p>Only a few old people thought of the old tale ; but they had noticed that when the land was drained a huge well was discovered near the middle of the haven, lined with solid though antique masonry, which fully confirmed to them the truth of the old story ; and they never doubted but that the elfs would soon reclaim their own. Their anticipations were quickly confirmed. It was reported that, at certain times, and especially before storms, a noise was heard as of innumerable hammers beating against ” the piles and strange defenses ;” and an old man, it was said, had actually witnessed one night a great many pigmy creatures busily at work about them. Be that as it may, the waters, after a brief space, began to find an entrance through crevices in the banks ; the piles, one by one, gave way, and at last the sea flowed once more without restraint over the spot from which it had been with so much labour expelled. At the present day little is left of Middleton’s contrivances ; and little more, even, of the ancient tradition — the only part remembered being a vague account of the treasure and the white oxen which were to draw it out of the well ; but the scene of the story is transferred to a well that exists, or is believed to exist, in a copse on the west bank of the harbour ; though there is also a confused notion that the treasure and the well are in some way connected with the fate of the haven.</p>

<p>Bembridge and its Prospects. —Our correspondent writes as follows :— I paid a visit to this little village on Tuesday on the occasion of the annual regatta, and was surprised at the change which a few years had made in the locality. Situated at the extreme eastern end of the Island, and cut off from communication with Ryde by the harbour, it has hitherto been so difficult of access as to be quite out of the way of the general tourist and traveller . All this is being altered, and in a few months Bembridge will be as accessible as any other watering place in the Island. Desirous of examining the effects of the new reclamation works which keep back the water from what used to be ” Brading Harbour,” I walked from Brading to Bembridge along the old shore. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen’s side, just above the Mill, and terminating on the Bembridge aide near the Point. The sea is effectually kept out, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, the “harbour” now appears to be a brown and barren waste. As the mud banks have dried they I have cracked, and are covered with large fissures. Thousands of oookles, winkles, and sea weeds have come to a dry death in consequenoe of the reclamation, and their dried shells, which smell rather offensively, can be found by hundreds by scraping the surface of the banks. It will not be many years, however, before smiling green fields will make the inhabitants forget that this extensive tract was once covered with water. Here and there a blade of grass, hardier than its fellows, can already be seen sprouting. The new railway runs from the Brading Station by the side of what was the Harbour to St. Helen’s Mill, and will cross to Bembridge on the embankment. I noticed that there was still a good deal of water behind the embankment. This is fresh water, brought down by the River Yar, and flows through large flood gates up to the sea. On entering the village I saw a great change even within the last two years. A speculative gentleman, who had great faith in the place, many years ago built a large hotel and a number of houses, but, no doubt owing to the difficulty of getting to the place, these remained empty for a number of years. I noticed, however, that all the houses were now let, and that a number of visitors were walking about. With a railway brought close to it, I have not the slightest doubt that before many years are past Bembridge will rival Sandown and Shanklin. The arboreal beauties of the place are most striking. Avenues of trees shelter the roads, and the pathway to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of Shanklin Chine. The beach is as good as that of Sandown, and protected by a reef of rocks. Altogether there seems some justification for the inhabitants waking up to a sense of the long-neglected beauties of the locality, and indulging in the confident hope that their prosperous days are at hand.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">BEMBRIDGE AND ITS REGATTA. - Saturday, August 30th, 1879</p>

<p>Although the guide books acknowledge the picturesque beauties of the “little village of Bembridge,” they also complain of the difficulty of access to it. There have been hitherto no better means of reaching it from Ryde than taking a carriage or walking along the road to St. Helen’s, and then crossing the mouth of the harbour at the ferry. This is so very awkward a route, and so extremely hilly, that Bembridge has remained till within the last year or so one of the most out-of-the-way places in the Island. On paying the place a visit on Tuesday, however, we were astonished at the change which about two years had made in the appearance of the locality. This change was almost entirely due to the new reclamation and railway works, which are still incomplete. Arriving at Brading by train, we took the opportunity of getting from thence to Bembridge by skirting along the shores of what used to be Brading Harbour. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen’s side just above the water mill, and terminating on the Bembridge side near the Point. This effectually keeps out the sea, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, Brading “Harbour” has now the appearance of a desert. The mud-flats are all dried — at least as far as the surface is concerned, — but, remembering certain awful warnings of people who had sunk into treacherous mud up to their knees, we did not venture far. The banks as they have dried have cracked, and are covered with extensive fissures that do not add to their beauty. It has been a sad time for the winkles, cockles, and sea plants. In some sandy places, on scraping the surface, scores of cockles which had been dried up in their shells were found, while there were numerous winkles and sea weed which had met a like sad fate. Through the centre of the reclaimed banks flows a rather large stream called the Yar. It is a curious fact that there are two streams in the Island which go by this name, and this causes some confusion in the minds of the tourists. The stream has been the principal difficulty in carrying out the work, and an exit had to be provided for it by means of flood gates. In a few years time the appearance of the reclaimed land will be as pleasing as it is now the reverse. Nature soon throws her green mantle over the most desolate-looking spots, if there is plenty of water, and doubtless in a few years the inhabitants, viewing the green meadows here, will almost forget that they were once covered by the sea. Even now in some places a blade or two of grass may be seen shooting up. There is little doubt that centuries ago this harbour consisted of smiling fields, upon which the sea burst, either suddenly or by degrees, till 700 acres were covered. In the interesting account of the unsuccessful reclamation by Sir Hugh Middleton, it is stated that in the centre of the harbour a well was found, proving the truth of our statement. The new railway runs by the side of the harbour as far as the mill, and will then cross the embankment to Bembridge, where a station is in course of erection. On entering the village we were struck with the alteration in the appearance of the place, which seemed waking up to a sense of its own importance. The shops had been enlarged and the once desolate looking hotel was occupied. Bembridge happened to have been visited some 30 years ago by one of those unfortunate individuals who ” live before their time.” Charmed with the beauty of the place, he thought that nothing more was necessary to attract visitors here than to provide accommodation for them. He built a large hotel, and speculated in building, but empty house property soon showed him that something more than natural beauty was required to induce people to reside here. We noticed, however, that all the houses now appeared full, and unmistakable visitors were walking about. A stroll through the place convinced us that it would not be many years before Bembridge would rival Shanklin and Sandown. It has a beach hardly inferior to the latter, and the approach to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of the celebrated chine of the former. Its arboreal beauty is the chief cha- racteristic of tne village, which nas some of the most lovely avenues we have ever seen. No doubt we saw the village at its best on Tuesday, that being the second day of the regatta.</p>

<p>—Between the Bembridge and St. Helen’s Cliffs, at the Isle Wight, the sea entered and formed a lake known Brading Harbour, covering area of about 900 acres. A company has been formed for the purpose of constructing a railway from the Isle of Wight Railway Company’s main line to St Helen’s and across the mouth of the harbour to Bembridge. The work is being carried out by Mr Seymour, contractor, and after a number attempts the tide has been completely shut out of the harbour by a thick embankment taken across from St. Helen’s to Bembridge, and the land reclaimed is to be used for farming, and building purposes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the sea had other ideas regarding the project, and not four months after the works were announced as complete, the ill-defended embankment was breached and Brading would soon be able to operate its quay once more.</p>
<p>The railway also looked to have been taking out of commission, at high tide at least.</p>

<p>The Reclamation or the Harbour.</p>
<p>The company who have been carrying out the new reclamation works at the mouth of Brading Harbour have met with a most serious reverse. The high tides a few days ago made a breach in the embankment, which has been gradually getting larger and larger, and now the sea has resumed its sway over the whole extent of mud flats which had been dry for some months, and vessels actually go up to the quay at Brading again for chalk. The railway which runs by the side of the harbour is also covered at high tide, and on taking a walk over it on Sunday we noticed that the rails were covered with seaweed, and that sand and shingle were banking up round it in some places. The extent of embankment washed away, in spite of every exertion, is said to be over 70 feet. The work of restoration was put in hand immediately after the breach, and the work is being prosecuted most vigorously, but we understand the embankment will take a different course, so as to avoid the heavy sea wbich runs, in here occasionally.</p>
</div>
<p>With repairs required, the cost was estimated at another £10,000.</p>

<p>The Reclamation Works.—</p>
<p>We last Monday paid a visit to the reclamation works at Brading Harbour, and found that the damage which had been done there was quite as great as had been reported. There was one part of the embankment, near the Bembridge side, which had to bear the brunt of the heavy sea which rolls in here. The embankment was sound enough, but nothing had been placed on its sides to keep the sand down in its place. The result was that the extraordinary high tide of a fortnight since washed over it, wetted the sand, which flowed away from the embankment like so much water. In a very short time a breach was made, and the sea had such a hold that it was impossible to stop it. The breach has since reached some 70 yards in width, and the sea has covered the whole of the harbour just the same as it did before the embankment was made. Vessels now come up and down the harbour to Brading Quay for chalk as if nothing had ever happened to check them. On walking down the side of the harbour we noticed that in several places the sea had covered the railway, and that the seaweed had washed over the rails, while the sand and shingle had silted up round them. It is, of course, of the utmost importance that the work should be put right, and a number of men are now at work re-making the embankment, which, we believe, will cross the harbour at a different point than it did before. Mr. Seymour has entered into a fresh contract to complete the work, and it is rumoured that his estimate of the cost of the new work required is £10,000. Mr. R. J. H. Saunders, the engineer of the company, writing to a contemporary, thus explains the cause of the accident : ” You will, no doubt, have heard that the extraordinary tide of last Friday night passed over the unfinished work at Bembridge, and within a very few hours a breach was made in the embankment so that the sea now flows again over the land reclaimed in June last. This is, of course, very disappointing, as the work was nearly completed along the whole length, and was everywhere considerably higher than the previous extraordinary tide. There was, therefore, no apprehension or thought of danger, and consequently no precautions were taken. This will, however, be a warning in the future to make assurance doubly sure, and to leave no point undefended. You will be pleased to learn that the work of restoration has already been put in hand. The directors were over the works yesterday with Mr. Grantham, the consulting engineer of the company, when, after very careful consideration of the whole question, it was unhesitatingly decided to prosecute the work vigorously, and an agreement was entered into for carrying it out at once with Mr. F. Seymour, the contractor, and I have every reason to believe I shall within two or three months have the satisfaction of informing you that the sea has been effectually shut out.”</p>
</div>
<p>A couple of reports from the start of 1880, including one from the <em>Railway Official’s Dinner</em>, suggest that the remedial works following the breach of late October, 1879, were still not complete.</p>

<p>The Harbour Reclamation Works.— The task of stopping the gap which was made in the embankment across the harbour, and throngh which the sea pours again over the whole of the mud flats, has proved to be a most formidable work, and the contractor has been obliged to sink old barges, laden with marl and chalk, across the channel. Many of the old inhabitants, however, are still very doubtful as to whether the work of stopping ont the water will ever be successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>The annual dinner of the officials of the Isle of Wight Railway Company took place at the Town Hall, Sandown, on Thursday even- I 3 ing, and was a very pleasant and enjoyable affair. Col. Atherley presided, and was supported by Messrs. W. H. Wooldridge, R. Dampier Child, Dudley Watkine, C. Johnson, G. A. Canton, Capt. Seymour, and other gentlemen. The vice-chair was taken by Dr. Dabbs.—Mr. Dore was caterer, and placed a very excellent dinner on the table.—The Chairman gave the loyal and patriotic toasts which were loyally received and responded to by—Mr. White for the Navy, Sergt.-Major Wickenden for the Army, and Capt. Seymour for the Reserve Forces.—The ” Bishop d&amp; Clergy” having been toasted, the Vice-Chairman proposed “Success to the Isle of Wight Railway,” and pointed out that every-one might drink the toast, as the success of the Isle of Wight Railway meant the success of all the towns in its  vicinity. (Applanse.)—The Chairman, in response to the toast, said he well remembered when this railway was first contemplated. Indeed he might say that he was one of its originators, and had the honour of being the first Chairman of the line. For a great numberof years he was a director, and, although circumstances compelled him to give up that post for a time, he was glad when he was able to join the directorate again. He had pleasure in knowing that the Company was exceedingly well served, their manager being a most excellent judge of character, and having surrounded himself with a number of most trustworthy officials. (Applause.)—Mr.Henley proposed the “Donors,” a toast which was responded to by Mr. R. he Dampier Child.—Mr. W. H. Wooldridge gave the “Engineer and Manager, Mr. Joseph Bourne,” whose name was very warmly received, and on whose behalf Mr. Shaw, an old servant of the Company, responded.—Mr. Shaw next gave “The Companies in connection,” and referred to the great works which the joint Railway Companies were now carrying out at Ryde. These works were now in a very forward state, and it would not be long before they would be able to run a train to the Pier gates, and a very little longer before they could take them to the end of the Pier. The overland companies had gone to enormous expense in carrying out these works, and he believed it was also intended to improve the communication by water. He was sure that all these improvements could not fail to be beneficial to the inhabitants of the Island. There was another small railway in connection with theirs—the Brading Harbour Company, which, like the rest, could, not fail to feed the main line.—Capt. Seymour responded, and said that he had been connected with the Company last mentioned, who had spent over 100,000l. in the endeavour to shut out the sea from Brading Harbour. The undertaking, it was thought, was successfully accomplished,  his contract was at an end, and it was thought there remained nothing more to do, when unfortunately the sea again proved the master, The Company then came to him once more, and, with the pluck of Englishmen, resolved to try again, but whether they would succeed he was not yet able to say.—Mr. J. S. Elgee responded for the ” London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company,” and Mr. Frederick Fowles for the “South-Wesern.” The remaining toasts were: “The Chairman,” “Vice-Chairman”, ” The Visitors,” (humurously responded to by Mr. Dudley Watkins), “The Secretary of the Entertainment, Mr. Geo. Henley,” “The Press,” and “The Ladies.” The meeting did not break up till a late,.</p>

<p>As work in the repairs presumably progressed, an intriguing report appeared in which Mr. Seymour, the contractor, denied having been responsible for inciting a distrubance the previous week.

<p class="admonition-title">RECLAIMING LAND FROM THE SEA. - Saturday, April 17th, 1880</p>

<p>Our Engraving represents a view of the entrance to Brading Haven, Isle of Wight, at low water, and a portion the new embankment recently constructed to reclaim the Haven from the sea. It was until recently a large tract marshy ground, with a bold inlet of the sea, at high water, covering all the low lands between Bembridge and St. Helen’s, about eight to nine hundred acres being overflowed by the sea every tide. Originally this marshy ground was greater extent; but a portion was reclaimed in the reign Edward I. by Sir William Bessel, then warden the island. In 1594 German Richards, Esq., made an acquisition mill, marsh, and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge. In the reign of James I. an attempt on a grand scale was made by Sir Hugh Myddleton to inclose, and recover the haven from the sea; but after an expenditure of £7000 it was discovered that much of the recovered land was a light, running sand; and, finally, after various experiments, the project came to disastrous issue. In April, 1877, the “Brading Haven Reclamation Company accepted a tender of Mr. Frederick Seymour, of Bembridge (who had previously constructed the railway from Brading to St. Helen’s), for the construction of an embankment to reclaim the land contained in the Haven; which arduous work was successfully completed on Feb. 22 last, thus adding 800 acres of valuable land to the Isle of Wight. It is intended to continue the railway on the new embankment (which is one mile in length) from St. Helen’s to Bembridge. As, doubtless, many of our readers know, Bembridge is a village of great beauty, clothed in leaf and shade, nestling at the foot of Bembridge Down. It is an extremely picturesque spot, but, having previously been out of the ordinary track, has attracted but little notice. It is, however, well worthy of a visit, and its many retired nooks afford capital accommodation for picnics. Its sands, too, are firm and smooth, and offer good opportunities for sea-bathing. The view from the summit of Bembridge Down is the finest in the island. To the north the eye looks over the gently swelling grounds of St. Helen’s and sea view to Ryde; and, when glancing over the Solent, with fits majestic ships, commands the harbour of Portsmouth, Hayling Island, and the line of the Hampshire and Sussex coasts, where the slender spire of Chichester Cathedral may be seen pointing heavenwards —while the coast terminates in the blue haze which marks the position of Beachy Head. To the south is beheld Sandown Bay, with its loamy cliffs alternately rising and sinking, until they tower in the gigantic mass of Dunmore and Shanklin Down. To the west the eye commands a wide view of the inland hills and valleys ; immediately below, the Yar winds its sinuous way through the green pastures of Brading Haven. Now that the land has been reclaimed and the facilities for reaching Bembridge are improved, in all probability this will become one of the favourite watering places in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon an old-fashioned but at the same time very pleasing custom was celebrated at the Priory, where the tenants of the Manor of ” St. Hellenes, otherwise Eddington,” attended a Court Baron called by the Lard of the Manor, Mr. Henry Grose-Smith. Mr. J. Binfield Bird having read the annual proclamation, the following were sworn as the ” homage” : — William Dash (foreman), Benjamin Dash, Emanuel Wade, C. Midlane, James Nash, and William Joseph Nash. — A number of alterations which had occurred since the last court was held were noted, and the representatives of several persons deceased ” took up their admissions.” Mr. Midlane was noted as having encroached on land belonging to Mr. Smith, which, however, he did not admit, and the Court determined to view the spot in dispute. The construction of a road along the south-west side of St. Helen’s Green by the Brading Harbour Railway Company was reported, and Mr. Bird reoommended that the company be ” amersed” in the annual sum of 5s.— The Lord of the Manor observed that he thought they had better fix the amount at a nominal sum, inasmuch as the road was a great public convenience.— Mr. Allen asked who would receive the money ?— Mr. Bird said the Lord of the Manor, of course. — Mr. Allen : By what right does he receive it ? — Mr. Grose-Smith said he was owner of the soil of the Green as Lord of the Manor, and it was his duty, in conjunction with that court, to see that the wastes of the manor were not infringed upon. All such infringements were to be presented to the Court Baron of the Homage, who could deal with them as they liked — inflict a penalty, or even order auch infringement to be put back. In this case it was a great advantage to have the road as an approach to the Railway Station, but he thought they ought to inflict a fine just to get an acknowledgment that the company had encroached on the waste. On the suggestion of Mr Midlane it was eventually decided to ” amerse” the Railway Company in the sum of 1s.</p>

<p>In 1781, Sir Richard Worsley, in his famous History of the Island, considered it, worthy to chronicle the Haven ” us a large tract of marshy ground, containing 856 acres, covered every tide by the sea.” The recovery of so large a piece of land from the sea had been long an object in contemplation, and Sir John Oglander had preserved accounts of several undertakings for this purpose. A part of Brading Haven was taken in by Sir William Russell, Lord of Yaverland (Warder of the Isle of Wight, in the reign of Edward I.), at the time when Yarbridge was erected. In the year 1562, another parcel of land was walled in from the sea by Mr George Oglander and Mr German Richards, when the North-marsh and some adjoining lands qere gained, and in 1594 a third acquisition was made of Mill-marsh and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge by Mr Edward Richards. The next attempt was of a more extensive nature ; a grant ot the Haven was obtained from King James the 1st, by Gibbs, a groom of the bed chamber. The owners of the adjoining lands contested this grant, which the King was very earnest in supporting. After a verdict obtained in the exchequer against the gentlemen of the Island, Gibbs sold his share for £2000 to Sir Bevis Thelwwall, a page of the King’s bed chamber, who admitted the famous sir Hugh Miiddletou to a share from the sea. The first taking of it in cost £4000, and £1000 more were expended in building a dwelling house, barn, a watermill, trenching, quick setting, and other necessary works, so that, including the original purchase, the total expenditure amounted to £7000. But after all, the nature of the ground did not answer the expectations of the undertakers, for though that part of it adjoining Brading proved tolerably good, nearly one half of it was found to be a light running sand. Nevertheless as incontestible evidence appeared, by the discovery of a well cased with stone near the middle of the Haven, that it had formerly been good ground Sir Hugh Middleton tried a variety of experiments on the land which had been taken in before he sold his share, sowing it with wheat, barley, oats, cabbage, and finally with rape seed, which last was most successful. But the greatest discouragement was that the sea brought up so much ooze, weeds and sand, which choked up the passage for the discharge of the fresh water. At length, in a wet season, When the inner part of the Haven was full of water, and a high spring tide, the water met under the bank and made a breach. Thus ended this expensive project, and though Sir John Oglander, who lived in the neighbourhood confessed himself a friend to the undertaking, he declared it as his opinion that the scheme could never be resumed to any profitable purpose, and the following estimate in 1699 of the expenses necessary to recover it shews that the enclosing was again in contemplation :</p>
<p>May 10th, 1699.— The abstract of an estimate of the charge of taking in, draining, and securing of the Haven of Brading, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The damme, or sea wall, will be best to stand near about where the old wall stood, with some difference in the range and variation of the line thereof.</p>
<p>Ths wall will contain in length about 3400 feet, and will be cheapest and best done,to consist of the nearest matter at hand, which is a strong stiff clay, with which is to be mingled some other proper material, the delivery, casting, filling, ramming, arming, and sufficiently defending and securing this wall will cost about six shillings per foot running, which amounts to 1020 0 0<br />
There must be two very substantial sluices which will cost the sum of £900 0 0<br />
The charge of utensils of all kinds my amouut to about 250 0 0<br />
The charge of closing and secutely shutting in of ihe old channel, which will be most difficult and troublesome work of the whole undertaking, will come to the sum of 1000 0 0<br />
The profit or recompense to the undertaker, whoever he may be, who shall be found able and successfully to design and execute the work, cannot in justice be less than the sum of 1000 0 0<br />
The total is £4170 0 0<br />
Hy. Sher, Surveyor.</p>
<p>We reprint the historian’s record of 1781, and refer to the successful reclamation of the Haven in 1881, believing such will be interesting to our readers. We regret we cannot, as we should like to do, record the actual cost, and therefore beg our readers not to conclude the wonderful estimate of Hy. Sher, surveyor, of May 16th, 1699, has covered all. Doubtless the Englishmen had, or will have, before the accounts are totalled, a few extras, which the Dutchmen could not get a certificate for. We however, hope the Brading Harbour Reclamation Company have followed the wise advice of the old surveyor and made some difference in the range and valuation of the line of the wall, from the unfortunate lines of Sir Hugh Middleton and his partner. and that they have mingled with the clay used in their wall some other proper material, and may it prove the estimated profit or recompense of the old surveyor will be far exceeded.— Communicated.</p>

Some of the men in the employ of the company, seeing tbh danger of the barge running into some of the posts and woodwork, called to the ma  to let go his anchor, which he did. The anchor, however, dragged for a long distance, and, when a hold was obtained, the ring fastening the anohor to the chain broke, and the barge drifted down on to the piles, breaking several and doing other damage to the amount claimed. There had been a danger buoy placed at the mouth of the harbour; but the witnesses for plaintiffs could not say whether there was a danger board on it at the time of the accident. One was placed there afterwards, when the engineer also had a chain placed across the harbour. — His Honour gave judgment for the plaintiffs for £10.</p>

<p>Careless Navigation. Brading Harbour Company v. Thompson. — This action was heard at the Portsmouth County Court on Thursday, in which it was sought to recover £16 5s., the costs of repairs of damage done through negligent navigation of the barge Jane, of which defendant is the owner. From the evidence it appeared that at the end of December the barge entered Brading harbour with a strong tide, and having only one ma  on board, who seemed unable to manage it, the vessel drifted helplessly towards the piles erected in the improvement of the harbour. The ma  employed on the works shouted to the bargeman to throw a line and let go the anchor, but it was stated the ma  ” lost his head” through fear, with the consequence that the anchor chain broke and the vessel, colliding with the piles, caused the damage to the amount of the claim. — Mr. Ring appeared for the defendants, and argued that it was purely an accident. — His Honour gave judgment for £10.</p>

<p>ASSAULT</p>
<p>George Stickley, in the employ of the Reclamation Company, at St. Helen’s, was summoned for assaulting Henry Smith, of St. Helen’s.— Mr. Thirkell, who appeared for the complainant, said that defendant was the treasurer of a sick fund for the men employed on the Brading Harbour Works. There was a meeting on Monday, the 9th, at which complainant attended, and defendant’s books were gone through by Mr. R. Seymour, the time keeper. It was then found that defendant had not accounted for several sums which had been paid to him by the cashier for the past nine months. On Friday, the 11th, the complainant, in company with another, went to defendant and demanded an account of the the sums which had been paid in by the cashier, a list of which was handed to defendant. Defendant became very abusive and assaulted him in a very violent manner.— Complainant stated that when he went to defendant under the circumstances detailed, defendant struck him with his fist on the temple and almost rendered him insensible. — The other evidence given was rather contradictory, a witness called by defendant asserting that very high words passed between the two parties in the course of which complainant put his fist in defendant’s face.</p>

<p>The reclaimed land itself also appears to have needed the protection of a local constable:</p>

<p>At the County Petty Sessions on Tuesday, John Cook, of St. Helen’s, time keeper on the Brading Harbour Improvement Works, was charged with falsifying certain accounts, with the intention of emhezzling various sums of money. It appeared that it was the prisoner’s duty to go round the works and ascertain each day how long the men had worked, entering the particulars on printed pay sheets, together with the total amounuts due to each ma . The money was paid on Saturday morning, and if any of the men did not call for it, it was left at the canteen. In this instance prisoner entered the names of three men, who it was proved had not been on the works, in the pay sheet, and credited them with various sums, amounting altogether to between two and three pounds. The resident engineer (Mr. Walker) discovered the fraud and taxed the prisoner with putting dummy men on the pay sheet. Prisoner did uot deny it and asked to be forgiven.—He was committed for trial at the Sessions.</p>

<p>Tuesday.— Before W. A. Glynn, Esq (chairman), Col Baillie and Capt Lowther.</p>
<p>FALSIFYING accounts.</p>
<p>John Cook, a respectable looking ma , about 40 years of age, was charged that, being a servant in the employ of Henry Samuel Freeman, he falsified certain accounts, and endeavoured to obtain money under false pretences. Mr W. H. Wooldridge prosecuted, but the prisoner was undefended. Though the evidence was of a lengthy and somewhat formal character, the facts were simple enough. It appears that the prisoner had been a timekeeper on the Brading Harbour Works in the employ of Mr Freeman, the receiver appointed in connection with the company. From the evidence of Mr James Walker, the resident engineer, it seems that it was prisoner’s duty to go round the works several times a day, take the number of those employed and the number of hours they worked, and enter these particulars in a time sheet with the rate at which each ma  was paid, and the total amount due to each ma  per week. These returns were made out on a properly printed form and were made up to Friday night, the men being paid at noon on Saturday. On the pay sheet for the week ending February 4th the name of a ma  named Libiter was shown as having worked nine hours, at 4d per hour. On the pay sheet for the week ending February 4th there were entries of two men, Bond and Brady, the former as having made 44 hours (18s) and a similar amount against Brady, while a ma  named Libiter was credited with 18s 4d. The money due to these men was put into paper bags and taken into a small wooden house, and if the men did not come for their money it was taken to the canteen. In this case the money never went to the canteen, because it was found that the men were not actually at work, but the bags containing the money presumed to be for them were produced and their names written upon them were stated to be in the handwriting of the prisoner. Mr Walker called the prisoner to him on Saturday and told him he had been putting dummy men on the pay sheet. Prisoner at first denied it, but afterwards asked to be forgiven and that Mr Walker would let him go. George Stickley, George Carter, and Thomas Johnson, gangers in the same employ as the prisoner, deposed that none of the men whose names appeared on the pay sheet were actually at work on the dates mentioned. The prisoner, who had nothing to say, was committed for trial at the sessions. — Bail, however, was allowed — himself in £100 and two sureties of £50 each.</p>

<p>Even with the presence of the special constable, it seems the company still had to resort to the courts on occasion regarding what they perceived as improper use of their land:</p>

Witness : I did mention wildfowl. — By Mr W. H. Wooldridge : There are hares and partridges there. I have seen them shot there. — The Chairman : Is it not a notorious fact that people sit on the wall there and shoot wildfowl ? — Witness : The defendants were on the land. — The Chairman : Were they in pursuit of game . — Witness : I can’t say ; they were in the harbour. — Admiral Sir Erasmus Ommauney : What do you mean ? Were they in a boat ?—Witness . No ; on the mud. — Defendants said they were simply waiting on the wall for wildfowl. It was absurd to talk about hares and partridges being there, as the harbour was overflowed at the time. — The case was dismissed.</p>

<p>Discovery of a Roman Villa near Brading.</p>
<p>An addition has been recently made to the historical attractions of the Isle of Wight by the discovery of Roman Villa at Moreton Farm, near Brading. The remains disclosed have already excited considerable interest among archaeologists, and it has been suggested by some of the Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London that further excavations be undertaken in order to ascertain the extent of the building or buildings, only a portion of which has been yet discovered. The first discovery of the villa is due to Captain Thorpe, of Yarbridge, near Brading, whose acquaintance with the neighbourhood led him to investigations which have proved to be of considerable interest in their connexion with the early history and occupation of the island. Some accounts of these preliminary explorations bave been published. The external walls, at present cleared, measure about 52ft. by 37ft., and enclose about six or seven chambers, with passages, connected, there is reason to believe, with others. In addition to tessellated floors, remains of hypocausts, flues, fresco paintings, roofing tiles, coins, pottery, and other interesting relics, there are the remains of a mosaic pavement, with design upon it of unusual character, and one which is worthy of careful study and attention. The design, though grotesque, is doubtless symbolical, and may be connected either with the mythology of the ancients or the early introduction of Christianity. Its interpretation is not here attempted. Other decorated floors are known to exist the vicinity, and these, when properly examined, may assist in the explanation. The remains evidently cover a large area, much of which under cultivation, but every facility for investigation has been accorded by Lady Oglander, the owner of the land, and Mr. Cooper, the present occupier. Excavations have been accordingly renewed, and are at present under the direction of Mr. John E. Price, F.S.A., and Mr. F. G. Hilton Price, F.G.S. Work was commenced last week, and already a new chamber has been opened up, enclosing an interesting mosaic, the central design of which is a representation of Orpheus playing on the lyre, and surrounded by animals, as usual. The border is an unusually good example of what known as the guilloche pattern. Pottery, glass, and coins have been also found ; among the latter several third brass of the reign of Victorious, a.d. 268. These investigations are important in their relation to the occupation of the island by the Romans. It has been said that the dark hair and brilliant eyes of the veritable natives are due to the Italian colonists. Its annexation to the Imperial power, due to Vespasian, in the first century, and its association in the third century with the fortunes of Carausius and Allectus, are indications of prolonged connection with tho Empire, yet the historians of old are silent as to the rinding of remains. Some, indeed, speak of them unknown. Of late years, however, the contrary ins been amply proved, and it is import tant that all Mich discoveries as the present should be carefully studied and described Inscriptions or other data may yet bo found which may shed considerable light what is already known the history the Isle of Wight during the Roman colonisation.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">ROMAN REMAINS AT BRADING, ISLE OF WIGHT - Saturday, January 1st, 1881</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000057/18810101/017/0014">Graphic</a>, 1881-01-01, p. 14</p>
<p>“THE Isle of Wight,” says Mr. Cornelius Nicholson, in his interesting monograph on this subject, just published by Mr. Elliot Stock, ” is replete with archaeological interest: peppered, it may be said, with antiquarian relics. As it has been successively occupied by every tribe of settlers that has contributed to the pages of English history, it presents on its material surface a chart of our. early annals.</p>
<p>” Vespasian occupied the island about A.D. 43, and took possession of Carisbrooke, admirably suited, on account of its elevated position, to be the Capitolium of the island. Within a hundred yards of that fortress the now well-known Roman villa was discovered in 1858. This is dwarfed into insignificance by that at Brading, recently unearthed, and which is situated on the lower slope of a chalk hill, overlooking an inlet of the Solent, called Brading Harbour, where the Roman galleys could ride and anchor in perfect safety.</p>
<p>” Only the principal apartments are yet brought to light, and the Porta, or main entrance, is still undiscovered. A dozen entertaining rooms are disclosed in one suite of the buildings, one of which—it may have been a corridor—is sixty feet long. This block alone measures some two hundred feet by fifty-two.”</p>
<p>” But the striking distinction of this villa, next to its ample dimensions consists in the number and elegance of its mosaic pavements. There is nothing like this grouping in England, if elsewhere. The State aparmnent, 50 feet by 18 feet, presents from end to end the features of a horizontal picture gallery, a tesselated Pinacotheca. ” Our artist’s description of his drawing is given below. We will here, therefore, merely add that the first and minor portion of this villa was revealed by Captain Thorp and Mr. W. Munns, of Brading, in April last: the major portion has been excavated under the superintendence of Messrs. J. E. and F. G. H. Price. These gentlemen, together with Mr. Nicholson, form a Committee to solicit subscriptions, and to try and preserve these important relics of the past.</p>
<p>Fig. I is the smaller half of what is supposed to be the reception room of a Roman noble’s villa. This is the most complete portion of the discovery, the tesselated flooring being almost intact.</p>
<p>At the eastern end is a group of Tritons and Naiads, within an ornamental border, and joining is a square, g feet 6 inches in width, in the centre of which is the head of Medusa. Then we have in four oblongs, Daphne, surprised by Apollo, being turned into a laurel tree (the leaves are shown in the gracefully flowing garment), in the act of transformation. Next (moving with the sun) are Apollo and a female figure surrounded by serpents; a shepherd with a Panpipe and shepherdess, playing on a drum with her elbow and dancing;and, lastly, Ceres presenting an ear of corn to the husbandman. Between each oblong is a bust of Mercury playing a spiral shell-shaped horn. The whole is artistically surrounded with skilfully-planned borders.</p>
<p>Passing from this section of the reception room to the larger portion, the mosaics are not in so perfect a state, the centre of the square being almost gone, leaving but three corners, which repre- sent the Seasons: “Spring,”with the buds in her hair; “Summer,” with fruit and flowers bursting; and “Winter,”with a costume suggestive of mourning; “Autumn” is not traceable.</p>
<p>At the western end of this portion of the apartment is a group of figures: ” Perseus Rescuing Andromeda ” after having decapitated Medusa, whose head he is holding in his right hand. The reception room was supposed to be divided by means of a curtain, suspended from an arch. Beneath the curtain and annexed to the small square is the figure of an astrologer with a beard, and surrounded by a dial, globe, and crucible (Fig. 8). Before entering this apartment the visitor meets with a curious work, very much damaged, but quite perfect enough to suggest that the figure represents Orpheus with his lyre charming the wild denizens of the forest. There are the fore parts of a peacock, two other birds, a monkey, and a fox (Fig. 6).</p>
<p>Fig. 9 are hones of the wild ox, an extinct animal, a part of the horn of the fallow deer, and an iron nail. The comparative size of each may be judged when it is stated that the part of the femur bone measures 9 1/2 inches, The above-mentioned subjects are on Lady Oglander’s estate. The remains were first discovered on the adjoining farm. A shepherd was endeavouring to plant some hurdles to enclose sheep in a turnip field, when finding he could make no impression after a certain depth, his curiosity led him to dig. He then discovered traces of tesselated pavement ; the ground was cleared, and the curious devices (Fig. 7) came to light. In the centre is a bust of Bacchante, in one corner Bacchus, Fox, and Grapes, and the strange figure of a ma  in a blouse, with a head and legs resembling a fowl. The other subjects are two flying leopards. Further operations will be carried on next spring, when it is anticipated that many more curiosities will be discovered. In the turnip field, which is ten acres in extent, there are numerous indications of foundations covering nearly the whole space.</p>

<p>THE HARBOUR AND RAILWAY.—An extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Brading Harbour Improvement and Railway Company was held at 19, Walbrook, E.C., on Monday, for the purpose of approving the Bill now before Parliament. The meeting was of a purely formal character, and lasted only a few minutes. Under the Bill it is proposed to revive the powers granted under the Act of 1874, particularly with reference to the construction of the railway between St. Helens and Bembridge, commencing near the St. Helens Quay, on the of Wight Company’s branch line, and ending at Bembridge Railway Station, which is now in a forward state of completion. The railway will run immediately inside the concrete embankment. The Bill will confer on the Southwestern and Brighton and the I.W. Railway Companies power to construct, maintain, and work this new railway, and will authorise the Brading Company to sell or lease their railway to either of these Companies. The Bill also gives power to the Brading Company to purchase or lease steam or sailing vessels for the conveyance of passengers and goods between Brading Harbour and Hayling Island. Portsmouth, and Southampton. The Company likewise seeks power to form roads and grant building and other leases on the reclaimed land. We understand that the new railway will he complete and open for traffic this summer, and it will be the means of opening out to visitors and tourists oue of the prettiest parts of the Island, which has hitherto been neglected on account of its difficulty of sccess. Immediately opposite the Bembridge Railway Station, and facing the entrance of the Brading Harbour, a large hotel is being built, and will be finished and opened before the summer.</p>

<p>However, the proposal sought a cessation to various <em>easements</em>, which is to say, rights over certain uses of the land granted to other parties, granted by the original terms of the Act. And the members of St. Helen’s Local Board were not happy…</p>

<p>An extraordinary meeting of this board was held on Monday afternoon to consider the new Bill sought to be obtained by the Brading Harbour Improvement Company for additional powers. The Chairman, Mr. Stone, explained that the only provision which affected tbat board was one whereby the company sought to stop all easements.

If this were stopped the board would have to construct a sewer to run a considerable distance, and he considered that, under the provisions of the Railway Aot, the oompany would have to make this diversion.

<p>A special meeting of this Board was held on Monday afternoon at the Surveyor’s office, when there were present Messrs Stone (Chairman), W. A. Glynn, Bell, Brook, Moody, Tutte, and J. T. Almy.</p>
<p>Brading Harbour Improvement Works (Additional Powers) Bill.— The Chairman said that the meeting had been called to consider the new Bill of the Brading Harbour Company, whereby they sought to obtain additional powers. The only clause in their Bill which affected that Board was that whereby the company sought powers to stop up certain easements. This would apply to the watercourse, by which the water on the sewage farm at St Helen’s escaped. If this easement were stopped the Board would have to go to the expense of constructing a sewer to divert it outside the company’s works. He considered that by the Railway Act the company ought to make this diversion.— The Clerk said he found that the sanction of the Local Government Board to carry out the sewage works at St Helen’s was obtained in 1873, and that in the following year Mr Allen carried out the work. The Companies’ Act was passed in 1874, so there was nothing he thought to exempt the company from the provisions of the Railway Act.— The Chairman said that the sewage of their farm, after it had been used, went down this waterway into the harbour. The company had turned this harbour into dry land, and the company now said they intended to contest their right to carry the water into the harbour. By the Railway Act, if the company interfered with any drains or water courses, they were bound to provide others as good.— Mr Moody said he understood that the company said they did not come into the Local Board district at all.— The Clerk said there was the station. —— Mr Moody: That is empty now.— The Clerk : They must pay rates for it as soon as it is occupied.— Mr Moody said it did not look as if the harbour was dry land that morning. There was as much water there as ever there was.— The Chairman : Fresh water, I suppose. — Mr Moody : Yes. — The Chairman said there was a difference between a fresh water lake and the sea. If the harbour had been a fresh water lake they could not have discharged sewage into it, but as the harbour was an arm of the sea when they first discharged sewage water into it, there was nothing to prevent them doing so, and the company having interfered with them was bound to reinstate their “easement” if they stopped it up.— Mr Glynn said they must recollect that the harbour was private property. The company bought it off the Oglander family, and they would not have done so if the Oglander family had not the right to sell. Then again, the Board did not discharge sewage into the harbour. — The Chairman : No, but the water is highly impregnated with sewage. The question was, would the company come to any arrangement with the Board as to diverting it ? — Mr Moody : It would be an immense amount of work.— The Chairman : No, I think not very great. — The Surveyor was called in and questioned— He said that to make a sewer to divert the watercourse would cost about £200. They would have to carry it about 300 yards to get it past the oyster beds. They would have to take it right to the Duver.— Mr Glynn : That wouldn’t do.— The Chairman said the question was whether they could come to some arrangement to avoid the necessity of opposing the company. The General Act did not say a word about sewers.— Mr Bell asked if any communication had been made to the company in order to see whether they would come to terms. — The Clerk said they wrote to the company’s solicitors telling them about this easement or overflow of water from this sewage farm, and telling them they must provide for it. In reply, they said they must oppose. — After some further discussion, on the motion of Mr Glynn, it was resolved to take all necessary steps for opposing the Bill, and to pay the necessary expenses of such opposition out of the general district rate.— The Clerk (Mr Vincent) was also instructed to get a petition prepared and lodged if necessary.— It was also resolved to take counsel’s opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>A public meeting of the ratepayers of St Helen’s district was held at St Peter’s school room on Saturday last, to consider whether they should support the Local Board in opposing the above Bill now before ParUament. The Chairman of the Local Board (Mr H. Stone) occupied the chair, and amongst those present were the Rev J. T. Almy, Messrs Moody, S. Caws, N. Caws, Calloway, Matthews, Allen, and Capt Fendall.</p>
<p>The Chairman said the meeting was called to obtain their sanction to oppose the Bill, the Local Board having agreed to it at their last meeting. The Board had no wish to recklessly spend the money of the ratepayers, for if they did that they would be spending their own money individuaUy, as some of the members of the Board were large ratepayers. The clause in the new Bill which they wished to oppose was the 21st, which was to the effect that all rights, interests, easements, and privileges of and kind whatsoever existing in respect of the whole or any part of the lands acquired by the company other than the rights, easements, and privileges of the company, and any person, corporation, company, or association claiming them or under them, in, over, or in respect of such land or any part thereof, shall henceforth absolutely cease, and be for ever extinguished. If that clause passed in that form, he need scarcely tell them that the whole of their surface drainage might be stopped, and there would be no means of opposing the action taken by the company. It was declared by the section that all the Board’s rights in respect to the existing easements shall cease, and this was against the spirit of general legislation. What they wanted at present was to guard against the action that might be taken by the company to prevent them using the easements for their surface drainage without substituting another. If they could obtain an undertaking from the company to substitute another easement, they would not proceed any further in the matter. The present Bill had been sprung upon them uuawares, and it had passed standing orders, and the ParUamentary agents said that th«y must file a petition by next Thursday to be in time for opposing. He had written to Mr Freeman, the chairman of the company, to obtain an interview on the subject, to endeavour to come to an amicable arrangement, but that gentleman was away, and he expected to have seen him that morning. He would see him at the earliest opportunity, but it was necessary to obtain the sanction of the public meeting at once.</p>
<p>Mr S. Caws asked the Chairman if he had any idea of the costs, and whether they could join with any one else.</p>
<p>The Chairman replied that he could not give any idea as to the costs, but he believed that the Oglander trustees and the Commissioners would be opposing.</p>
<p>The Rev J. T. Almy said that the fact of their lodging the petition would not necessitate their fighting the battle. He thought that if they could make a joint movement it would save expense.</p>
<p>The Chairman said that the Oglander trustees thought it better to take separate action.</p>
<p>Mr Matthews remarked that the company hadn’t defined the boundary.</p>
<p>The Chairman replied that if they had known that before the company sent up their Bill, they might have prevented its passing the standing orders. On their plans the boundary line was wrong. A desultory conversation ensued, and it was ultimately decided to support the action of the Board.</p>

<p>This Bill, the object of which is to revive the powers and extend the time for the completion of a portion of the railway and works authorised by the Brading Harbour Improvement Railway and Works Act, 1874, came before the Examiner last Friday, for further proofs on the stand orders. After hearing the parties, the Examiner found that the standing orders had been complied with.</p>

<p>As part of the extended works, it seems that the Harbour Company had put a new road in from St. Helen’s to the quay, but the quality seems to have been lacking.</p>

<p>New Road at St. Helen’s.</p>
<p>A letter was read from the Brading Harbour Improvement Company stating that the road had been constructed from St Helen’s to the quay in accordance with the specifications provided by the Board, and asking that the Board would instruct their surveyor to inspect the same. The Surveyor having reported that he had inspected the same and did not find it satisfactory, the matter was referred to the Highway Committee for them to consider and report to the Board.</p>
