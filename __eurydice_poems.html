<h1>Memorial Poems on the Loss of the Eurydice<a class="headerlink" href="#memorial-poems-on-the-loss-of-the-eurydice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In the days and weeks following the loss of the Eurydice, testimonial and memorial poems appeared in newspapers across Britain.</p>
<p>As Natalie Houston describes in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40060322?seq=1"><em>Newspaper Poems: Material Texts in the Public Sphere</em></a>, Victorian Studies, Vol. 50, No. 2, 2008, pp. 233-242:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The inclusion of poems within the Victorian newspaper resists a simple definition of the page’s contents as purely informational. In considering the reception history of newspaper poems, we have to wonder who actually read these pages and with what kind of attention. Perhaps a humorous poem served as a kind of relaxation for the mind wearied by data or by more letters to the editor about the price of meat
(a recurring concern at mid-century). The meter and alternating rhyme typical of Victorian light verse make reading the poem a rapid and easy process, unlike the information that fills the rest of the page. Certainly, the indenting of poetic lines makes even short poems like sonnets visually stand out among the paper’s six tightly packed columns. The white space around the poems (and around the tables of racing results) possibly, even probably, caused some readers to look more closely at the text; it is just as likely that others immediately turned away, to information of immediate, practical advantage.</p>

<p><em>Pers. comm.</em>, Andrew Hobbs, 20/4/2022, it is interesting “that so many people turn to poetry in times of disaster, and also most of the poems you’ve found are published in places on or near the coast - Dundee, Liverpool, Montrose, Ulverston, Berwick, Drogheda - where geography meant more empathy?”</p>

<p>The training-ship Eurydice—<br />
As brave a craft, I ween,<br />
As ever bore brave men who loved<br />
Their country and their Queen-<br />
Built when ship, sir, <em>was</em> a ship,<br />
And not a steam machine.</p>
<p>A year or more she had been out<br />
About the Indian seas;<br />
And now, with all her canvas bent<br />
Before homeward breeze,<br />
Channel in her pride she came.<br />
The saucy Eurydice.</p>
<p>“Only an hour from Spithead, lads:<br />
Only an hour from home !”<br />
So sang the captain’s cheery voice<br />
As she clove the sunlit foam ;<br />
And each young sea-dog’s heart sang back,<br />
“Only hour from home !”</p>
<p>We saw the hills of Devon rise<br />
Fair in the Sabbath sun.<br />
We marked each hamlet gleaming white<br />
The church spires one by one.<br />
We thought we heard the church bells ring<br />
To hail our voyage done !</p>
<p>No warning ripple crisped the wave,<br />
To tell of danger nigh,<br />
Nor looming rack, nor driving scud—<br />
From out smiling sky,<br />
With sound as the trump of doom,<br />
The squall broke suddenly.</p>
<p>A giant squall of wind and snow<br />
From off the Devon shore,<br />
It caught us in its blinding whirl<br />
One instant, and more—<br />
For ere we dreamt of trouble near<br />
All earthly hope was o’er.</p>
<p>No time to shorten sail- no time<br />
To change the vessel’s course ;<br />
The squall had caught her crowded masts<br />
With swift, resistless force.<br />
Only one shrill, despairing cry<br />
Rose o’er the turmoil hoarse,</p>
<p>And broadside the great ship went down<br />
Amid the swirling foam ;<br />
And with her our four Hundred men<br />
Went down, in sight home<br />
(Fletcher and I alone were saved)–<br />
Only an hour from home .</p>

<p>O’er the calm bosom of the treacherous sea,<br />
The bright sun-shining on each snowy sail,<br />
Onward she speeds, though shortly doomed to be<br />
A victim to the fury of the gale.<br />
Oae gust of wind, one blinding cloud of snow<br />
That cast a gloom around her like the night,<br />
One bitter cry of agony and woe,<br />
And she had sunk for ever from our sight.</p>
<p>Fond hearts were waiting for her quiok return,<br />
Fond eyea were gazing far across the main ;<br />
Long may they watch, and long those hearts may yearn,<br />
For those on earth they ne’er will see again !<br />
Hearths will be desolate which were not so ;<br />
Loud the sad cry is heard on every side,<br />
And mourners weep in bitterness of woe<br />
For those who in their country’s service died.</p>
<p>All England feels for those who now are left,<br />
Widowed and fatherless, their loss to mourn ;<br />
Of all their lived unes suddenly bereft<br />
By fearful violence of the passing storm !<br />
Shine down, O sun, with thy bright cheering face,<br />
The world roils on as it has done before ;<br />
Grant those who died have found iheir resting place<br />
Above, where troubles shall be known no mure.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Poetry - FOUNDERING OF THE “EURYDICE” IN SANDOWN BAY. - Saturday, March 30th, 1878</p>

<p>Men stood aghast, as well they might, to hear<br />
The dreadful news last Monday morning brought:<br />
A gallant ship, with past three hundred souls,<br />
Hallf founded in the Bay on Sunday eve !<br />
So awful sudden this catastrophe<br />
That not a token reached the dwellers by<br />
To tell them hundreds of their fellow men<br />
Were, within eye-ken, struggling for their lives.<br />
No sadder tale has ever yet been told<br />
Or shipwreck’s horror, sudden and complete : —<br />
A noble frigate, gaily homeward bound,<br />
All her full press of suow-white canvas set,<br />
In swan-like state came sailing past our Bay.<br />
Over the waves majestic’ly she glides,<br />
Replete with life and lignt —a nation’s pride—<br />
An emblem of our rule upon the sea —<br />
A sight to charm the eye and stir the pulse.<br />
Sudden as ligutning’s strike, from Culver’s brow<br />
Swoops the fierce squall, ‘midst blinding sleet and snow,<br />
And, like a tiger springing on its prey,<br />
Bore down that gallant vessel to her doom.<br />
One moment saw her proudly ride the waves<br />
Exultant in her beauty and her strength ;<br />
The next, behind that curtain-cloud of storm.<br />
Hopelessly stricken, crushed, and settling down.<br />
So sank ihe Eurydice — as smart a craft<br />
As ever bore our meteor flag aloft.</p>
<p>Home from the West Indies she had sped,<br />
With wide-spread wings, and many a favouring gale,<br />
Till England’s longed-for shores were reached at last :<br />
Then, up the Channel, proud of har past fame,<br />
The brave old frigate pressed upon her way,<br />
With tensioned canvas spread ; to gain her port<br />
She rounds the Wight, and there before her lies<br />
The hoped-for haven— Portsmouth — full in sight,<br />
With home and kindling holding welcome out,<br />
Almost within the sea-worn wanderor’s grasp.<br />
God! what a moment that to be struck down ;<br />
To change home’s welcome for a watery grave ;<br />
To strew three hundred corses on the shore<br />
Where stalwart tonus, full of high hope and life,<br />
Were looked for by thair kindred and their Queen.</p>
<p>The news has cast a grief-cloud o’er the land,<br />
Dark’ning alike the palace and the cot ;<br />
And words of heartfelt sympathy well forth<br />
For those thus lost to us, and those bereaved.<br />
In meek submission to the Divine will<br />
We gather now our dead, who nobly died<br />
In full discharge of duty — even so,<br />
As though they fell in battle, face to face<br />
With England’s direst foe. Above their grave<br />
The sea lies calm, and golden-tinted clouds<br />
Look down with a mild pity on the spot<br />
Where lies the Eurydice ahd her brave crew.</p>

<p>Sunday, March 24, 1878.</p>
<p>The training-ship Eurydice—<br />
As brave a craft, I ween,<br />
As ever bore brave men who loved<br />
Their Country and their Queen —<br />
Built when a ship, sir, was a ship,<br />
And not a steam-machine.</p>
<p>A year or more she had been out<br />
About the Indian seas ;<br />
And now, with all her canvas bent<br />
Before a homeward breese,<br />
Up Channel in her pride she came,<br />
The saucy Eurydice.</p>
<p>“Only an hour from Spithead, lads:<br />
Only an hour from home!”<br />
So sung the captain’s cheery voice<br />
As she clove the sunlit foam ;<br />
And each young sea-dog’s heart sang back,<br />
“Only an hour from home !”</p>
<p>We saw the hills of Devon rise<br />
Fair in the Sabbath sun<br />
We marked each hamlet gleaming white—<br />
The church spires one by one.<br />
We thought we heard the church bells ring<br />
To hail our voyage done!</p>
<p>No warning ripple crisped the wave<br />
To tell of danger nigh.<br />
Nor looming rock, nor driving scud ;<br />
From out a smiling sky.<br />
With sound as of the trump of doom,<br />
The squall broke suddenly.</p>
<p>A giant squall of wind and snow<br />
From off the Devon shore —<br />
It caught us in its blinding whirl<br />
One instant and no more<br />
For ere we dreamt of trouble near<br />
All earthly hope was o’er.</p>
<p>No time to shorten sail— no time<br />
To change the vessel’s course ;<br />
The squall had caught her crowded masts<br />
With swift, resistless force.<br />
Only one shrill despairing cry<br />
Rose o’er the turmoil hoarse,</p>
<p>And broadside the great ship went down<br />
Amid the swirling foam ;<br />
And with her four hundred men<br />
Went down, in sight of home<br />
(Fletcher and I alone were saved)—<br />
Only an hour from home !</p>

<p>The following lines (signed “F. G.”) on the loss  of the Eurydice, appears in the <em>Baily’s Magazine</em> for this month :</p>
<p>‘Twas on a bright and breezy day<br />
A noble ship came sailing home,<br />
Dashing from either bow the spray,<br />
And ploughs up the milk white foam.</p>
<p>For the last time the gallant band,<br />
Close to “Old England on the lee,”<br />
Had said their prayers for those on land<br />
Who asked God’s aid for those at sea.</p>
<p>The sun is sinking towards the west,<br />
Tinging with gold the belying sail;<br />
The sailors take their Sabbath rest,<br />
And laugh and tell the oft-told tale.</p>
<p>The sister’s joy, the mother’s bliss,<br />
The dream of meeting of old friends,<br />
Of tight grasped hand, of lover’s kiss,<br />
For all their hard-ships make amends.</p>
<p>No cheery-hearted coastguard fails<br />
To point the ship to those who stand<br />
Around– whose prayers are in the sails<br />
Which waft her towards the friendly strand.</p>
<p>No wonder that the captain thought<br />
With honest hope and pride of soul,<br />
To bring the good ship, “smart and taut,”<br />
Like a swift racehorse to the goal.</p>
<p>Mid life and hope the thick black clouds<br />
Snow-filled that put the ship from view;<br />
The fierce tornado strikes her shrouds,<br />
She’s gone ! with all her home-bound crew.</p>
<p>The blood-red sun comes brightly back<br />
And lightens up the evening sky,<br />
And  paints what <em>was</em> the vessel’s track,<br />
As if in empty mockery</p>
<p>Alas ! for skill of human mind!<br />
He from whom good and evil come,<br />
Who rides upon the stormy wind,<br />
Took the three hundred wanderers Home.</p>

<p>WRITTEN ON A SICK BED</p>
<p>A sunny afternoon, so fair, so bright ;<br />
A Sabbath afternoon, so free from care!<br />
And those along the shore admire a sight<br />
Which stirs the heart of Britons everywhere.</p>
<p>A noble ship returning from the seas,<br />
A man of-war with sails all set and smart,<br />
So she may haply catch the slightest breeze<br />
To help her onward to the longed-for port.</p>
<p>And there on board the influence of the day<br />
Makes itself felt, and men have leisure given<br />
To rest, to read, to think, perchance to pray,<br />
And raise the soul awhile from earth to heaven.</p>
<p>Look at the group upon the headland there,<br />
Their eyes all dazed, their faces blanched with fear;<br />
They gasp for breath, and ask ” Where is she now?<br />
Tis but a moment since that she was here.’</p>
<p>A blinding snow storm falling fast and thick,<br />
A sudden squall that comes from off the shore—<br />
A lurch, a cry, then orders short and quick ;<br />
Too late, too late— she sinks —is seen no more!</p>
<p>More than three hundred men now lie at rest<br />
Beneath those treacherous waves so calm and clear ;<br />
Three hundred of our bravest, bonniest, best;<br />
All England feels the blow and sheds a tear.</p>
<p>Not for the lost alone, but for the left;<br />
The widowed souls now weeping for their love;<br />
The children fatherless; the parents reft<br />
Of their dear boy, now ocean’s treasure-trove.</p>
<p>Shall we not all contribute to their needs,<br />
And help these helpless ones, so sad and lorn?<br />
Let sympathy end not in words, but deeds!<br />
Remember ‘tis for us their hearts are torn!</p>

<p>There sailed the ship Eurydice—<br />
On board three hundred men,<br />
With all her steady canvas spread,<br />
For British seas again.<br />
From far Bermuda’s isles she sailed,<br />
That lie along the West,<br />
And left the realm of setting suns<br />
To seek the port of rest.</p>
<p>And now the Lizard’s past, and they<br />
Descry the distant land<br />
Loom dark along the rugged line<br />
Of cloven rock and sand;<br />
There rise before their eager gaze<br />
Fair hamlets and rich towns,<br />
There stretch stern Cornwall’s jagged cliffs,<br />
There Devon’s gentle downs.</p>
<p>The Sabbath morning rises blue<br />
Above the gloom of night,<br />
And on their lee they hail with joy<br />
The castled coast of Wight.<br />
Serene among its sombre mists,<br />
Like sea-beast in its lair ;<br />
And on the crowded deck there stands<br />
The happy crew at prayer.</p>
<p>No solemn warning from the sky<br />
Broke o’er their glad repose,<br />
As sweet upon the wintry air<br />
The sounds of worship rose.<br />
No voice from Nature’s myriad tongues<br />
Foretold their danger near,<br />
Within the sight of British land<br />
They did not dream of fear.</p>
<p>But now the tempest fiend awoke,<br />
And smote the mighty ship ;<br />
And low upon the stormy deep,<br />
Her lofty topmasts dip ;<br />
As when through forests of the south<br />
The dread tornado flies,<br />
O’erthrown upon the shattered earth<br />
The stately cedar lies.</p>
<p>Through open ports the waters rush<br />
With swift and surging stream,<br />
And like a giant stricken down,<br />
She lies upon her beam.<br />
And while wild shrieks of anguish fade<br />
Into death’s feeble gasp<br />
The engulfing billows clutch their prey<br />
In their relentless grasp.</p>
<p>Sad fate ! condole for Britain’s loss;<br />
Her brave three hundred men<br />
Shall never tread her glorious soil<br />
Or battle-decks again.<br />
Amid her sorrow let her bow,<br />
And weep like Niobe<br />
While blighted hearts and homes lament<br />
The lost Eurydice.</p>

<p>Ho! merrily home with her gallant crew,<br />
The dear old coast-line in full view,<br />
Up Channel under a press of sail<br />
She sped, careering before the gale.<br />
Taut and trim as a ship should be,<br />
For Spithead bound the Eurydice !</p>

And the manriners dreamt that toil was o’er;<br />

For the sun-burnt lads from the tropic isles;<br />

Around and aboard the Eurydice.</p>
<p>A change in the sky ! A sudden squall !<br />
And the blinding sleet’s bewildering fall !<br />
Down, down in a vortetx of foam and spray<br />

Fall, and will fall through the weary years ?<br />
Fond friends bitterly, night and day,<br />
Mourning the dear ones gone for aye;<br />
Sadly raising the cry to Thee–<br />
“O God, have pity on <em>all</em> at sea !”</p>
<p>Sad blow indeed ! Yet we’ll think with pride<br />
Like British tars at their posts they died.<br />

The dirge of the Eurydice?</p>

<p>“Eurydice,” twice-told, ill-fated name,<br />
The fullest agony of grief to claim.<br />
A bride beloved upon her marriage day<br />
Snatched ruthlessly by death’s stern hand away.<br />
Not her adoring lover’s destined bliss<br />
Was nearer consummation than was this<br />
Two oceans passed, and close at home once more<br />
Gazed at in rapture from old England’s shore,<br />
With all sails set, beneath a sunny sky,<br />
Wind and tide favouring. What bliss is nigh !<br />
Nay it is well-nigh grasped, that ” Welcome Home,”<br />
When the proud ship plunged into the tomb,<br />
As on the beauty of her out-spread wings<br />
The fatal blast in frenzied fury springs,<br />
Without a warning all those noble, brave<br />
Young throbbing hearts are silenced ‘neath the wave<br />
Without a warning o’er the calm bright sea,<br />
A message called them to eternity.<br />
Nor Orpheus’ self for his Eurydice<br />
Knew the wide sorrow that felt for thee.<br />
How many lives what love as true and strong,<br />
Will to their close the grief for thee prolong ?<br />
If Orpheus-like we fain would search the deep<br />
For thy dear treasures that -within it sleep,<br />
No power of wealth or talent can attain<br />
To bring the warm life gushing back again ;<br />
‘Twould be a cold and shadowy ghost alone<br />
That could not for lost love and hope atone.<br />
But oh ! begone, ye mystic shadows dim,<br />
Let holier, brighter faith now point to Him !<br />
Sleep, loved ones; “Sleep in Jesus;” may you rest<br />
Till ” the sea yields her dead,” then fully blest,<br />
May you, with Him, dwell through eternity<br />
In that good land where shall be no more sea,<br />
No tears, no partings, on that blissful shore,<br />
Where gallant ship shall pass by nevermore.</p>

<p>The day was bright and fair day could be,<br />
The blue with many sail was dotted o’er;<br />
Yet rode an angry surge upon the sea.<br />
That dashed its unspent wrath and baffled roar<br />
Around the frigate as she neared the shore—<br />
The stout old ship Eurydice.</p>
<p>Her every sail was set, and cheerily<br />
The crew responded to the boatswain’s call.<br />
“Keep her before the wind awhile,” said he;<br />
“We’ll make the port before the evenfall.<br />
Stand by, my lads! for yonder comes squall—<br />
A gale may be.”</p>
<p>Below was heard the cheery voice of song,<br />
As kits were packed and hammocks were untied;<br />
The hearty laugh as the joke along.<br />
Or Jack described the beauties of his bride.<br />
And suddenly stopped short— as by the side<br />
Lurched the Eurydice.</p>
<p>Above, the sun was down, and thick the dark,<br />
Dense clouds were driven before the rising blast;<br />
And staggering ‘neath a cloud of sail, the bark<br />
Tried to outspeed the sleet that hurried past;<br />
While ever and anon her trembling mast<br />
Dipped to the raging sea.</p>
<p>Then, rising, shook herself, as if to dare<br />
The winds and waters to their very worst;<br />
And gallant hearts and true were there<br />
To brave the dangers that the good ship durst;<br />
But fell, and stern adown the tempest burst,<br />
And smote Eurydice.</p>
<p>No timid shriek was heard above the roar;<br />
Captain and crew, each man was at his post;<br />
No panic as the stout old ship heeled o’er.<br />
And wisdom and good heart were needed most;<br />
No craven heart, I ween, when all was lost,<br />
And ’neath the waves sank she.</p>
<p>Then in the deadly gloom a moment white<br />
Fluttered her dripping canvas the sky.<br />
Like a pale ghost to greet the gathering night—<br />
The silent hail of those about to die.<br />
Into the deep without groan or cry<br />
Vanished Eurydice.</p>
<p>Whose was the blame? Not theirs who fought with Death<br />
That battle stiff and stern upon the deep<br />
Unconquered; they but yielded up their breath ;<br />
And still within their ocean-home they sleep.<br />
While many a British heart their fame will keep<br />
Who fought and died at sea.</p>

<p>“There is sorrow on the sea—it cannot be quiet”— Jer. xlix. 23.</p>
<p>The following poem, written by the late Captain M. A. S. Hare, of the Eurydice, in a friend’s album some years since, will be read with mournful interest:–</p>
<p>I stood on the shore of the beautiful sea,<br />
As the billows were roaming wild and free;<br />
Onward they came with unfailing force,<br />
Then backward turned in their restless course;<br />
Ever and ever sound their roar,<br />
Foaming and dashing against the shore;<br />
Ever and ever they rose and fell,<br />
With heaving and sighing and mighty swell ;<br />
And deep seemed calling aloud to deep,<br />
Lest the murmuring waves should drop to sleep.<br />
In Summer and Winter, by night and by day,<br />
Thro’ cloud and sunshine holding their way ;<br />
Oh ! when shall the ocean’s troubled breast<br />
Calmly and quietly sink into rest!<br />
Oh when shall the waves’ wild murmuring cease,<br />
And the mighty waters be hushed to peace?</p>
<p>It cannot be quiet—it cannot rest ;<br />
There must be Bearing on ocean’s breast :<br />
The tide must ebb, and the tide must flow,<br />
Whilst the changing seasons come and go.<br />
Still from the depths of that hidden store<br />
There are treasures teased up along the shore ;<br />
Tossed by the billows- then seized again—<br />
Carrieed away by the rushing main</p>
<p>Oh, strangely glorious and beautiful sea !<br />
Sounding forever mysteriously,<br />
Why are the billows still rolling on,<br />
With their wild and sad and musical tone?<br />
Why is there never repose for thee ?<br />
Why slumberest thou not, oh mighty sea?</p>
<p>Then the ocean’s voice I seemed to hear,<br />
Mournfully, solemnly— sounding near,<br />
Like a wail sent up from the caves below,<br />
Fraught with dark memories of human woe.<br />
Telling of loved ones, buried there,<br />
Of the dying shriek and the dying prayer ;<br />
Telling of hearts still watching in vain<br />
For those who never shall come again :<br />
Of the widow’s groans, the orphan’s cry,<br />
And the mother’s speeehless agony.<br />
Oh, no, the ocean can never rest<br />
With such secrets hidden within its breast.<br />
There is sorrow written upon the sea,<br />
And dark and stormy its waves must be ;<br />
It <em>cannot</em> be quiet, it <em>cannot</em> sleep.<br />
That dark, relentless, and stormy deep.</p>
<p>But a day will come, a blessed day,<br />
When earthly sorrow shall pass away ,<br />
When the hour of anguish shall turn to peace,<br />
And even the roar of the wares shall cease.<br />
Then out from its deepest and darkest bed<br />
Old Ocean shall render up her dead,<br />
And, freed from the weight of human woes,<br />
Shall unietly sink in her last repose.<br />
No sorrow shall ever be written then<br />
On the depths of the sea or the hearts of men,<br />
But heaven and earth renewed shall shine ,<br />
Still clothed in glory and light divine.<br />
Then where shall the billows of ocean be?<br />
<em>Gone !</em> for in heaven shall be “no more at sea !”<br />
‘Tis a bright and beautiful thing of earth,<br />
That cannot share in the soul’s “new birth ;”<br />
‘Tis a life of murmur and tossing and spray,<br />
And at resting-time it must pass away.</p>
<p>But, oh thou glorious and beautiful sea,<br />
There is health and joy and blessing in thee<br />
Solemnly, sweetly, I hear thy voice,<br />
Bidding me weep and yet rejoice—<br />
Weep for the loved ones buried beneath,<br />
Rejoice in Him who has conquered death ;<br />
Weep for the sorrowing and tempest-tossed,<br />
Rejoice in him who has saved the lost ;<br />
Weep for the sin, the sorrow, and strife,<br />
And rejoice in the hope of eternal life.</p>

<p>Return from death ! -return Eurydice !<br />
Appear again — nor sojourn in the grave;<br />
A thousand hearts are bleeding now for thee,<br />
And Britain’s self is mourning for the brave.</p>
<p>No lute melodious charms the cavern’d deep,<br />
To yield thee up, and life again restore  :<br />
With thee descending there for ever sleep<br />
Those lov’d and gallant hearts for evermore.</p>
<p>Nor yet shall fable unremember’d fall<br />
As thou returnuring seek’st again the sea.<br />
The voice of Memory, Orpheus like shall I call,<br />
And cry Eurydice! Eurydice!</p>
<p>From gallant life to death- one moment’s space,<br />
A darken’d sun- a stroke of unseen wing,-<br />
As though in air, some mystic Spirit chase<br />
Had cross’d the world in wildest Wandering.</p>
<p>Down, down Eurydice- beneath the storm-<br />

Thou through the briny space did’st hide thy form,<br />
And now we seek thee in thy rocky bed.</p>
<p>We seek thee now with love no fable knows,<br />
In cavern’d deeps- not Hades seen more drear,<br />
Nor Orpheus, sorrowing o’er his tender woes,<br />
Could mourn a fate more sad or more severe.</p>
<p>We seek thee eagerly- and now the tears<br />
Are mov’d again that fond Affection shed;<br />
Lo ! to the light thy long-lost form appears,<br />
And seems to bear a message from the dead.</p>
<p>In vain ! thy silent formn is changed and sad;<br />
We must awhile thy memory forego,<br />
Nor even with thy name restor’d be glad,<br />
Whilst it retains a record of our woe.</p>
<p>Affection may not gaze upon thy wrack,—<br />
Grief leaves Old Time to count the tearful cost,<br />
For e’en like Orpheus, Memnory looking back<br />
Is deemed to blend thee with the lov’d and lost.</p>

<p>1894</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Conan Doyle, The Home-Coming of the Eurydice</p>
<p>Conan Doyle was a resident of Southsea at the time of the disaster.  The poem was originally published in <em>The Speaker: The Liberal Review</em> dated March 24th, 1894, as “The Ballad of the Eurydice”. It was later collected as “The Home-Coming of the Eurydice”.</p>
<p>Poetry - The Home-Coming of the Eurydice</p>
<p>[Lost, with her crew of three hundred boys, on the last day of her voyage, March 23, 1878. She foundered off Portsmouth, from which town many of the boys came.]</p>
<p>Up with the royals that top the white spread of her!<br />
Press her and dress her, and drive through the foam;<br />
The Island’s to port, and the mainland ahead of her,<br />
Hey for the Warner and Hayling and Home!</p>
<p>“Bo’sun, O Bo’sun, just look at the green of it!<br />
Look at the red cattle down by the hedge!<br />
Look at the farmsteading—all that is seen of it,<br />
One little gable end over the edge!”</p>
<p>“Lord! the tongues of them clattering, clattering,<br />
All growing wild at a peep of the Wight;<br />
Aye, sir, aye, it has set them all chattering,<br />
Thinking of home and their mothers to-night.”</p>
<p>Spread the topgallants — oh, lay them out lustily!<br />
What though it darken o’er Netherby Combe?<br />
‘Tis but the valley wind, puffing so gustily—<br />
On for the Warner and Hayling and Home!</p>
<p>“Bo’sun, O Bo’sun, just see the long slope of it!<br />
Culver is there, with the cliff and the light.<br />
Tell us, oh tell us, now is there a hope of it?<br />
Shall we have leave for our homes for to-night?”</p>
<p>“Tut, the clack of them! Steadily! Steadily!<br />
Aye, as you say, sir, they’re little ones still;<br />
One long reach should open it readily,<br />
Round by St. Helens and under the hill.</p>
<p>“The Spit and the Nab are the gates of the promise,<br />
Their mothers to them—and to us it’s our wives.<br />
I’ve sailed forty years, and—By God it’s upon us!<br />
Down royals, Down top’sles, down, down, for your lives!”</p>
<p>A grey swirl of snow with the squall at the back of it,<br />
Heeling her, reeling her, beating her down!<br />
A gleam of her bends in the thick of the wrack of it,<br />
A flutter of white in the eddies of brown.</p>
<p>It broke in one moment of blizzard and blindness;<br />
The next, like a foul bat, it flapped on its way.<br />
But our ship and our boys! Gracious Lord, in your kindness,<br />
Give help to the mothers who need it to-day!</p>
<p>Give help to the women who wait by the water,<br />
Who stand on the Hard with their eyes past the Wight.<br />
Ah! whisper it gently, you sister or daughter,<br />
“Our boys are all gathered at home for to-night.”</p>

<p class="admonition-title">The Loss of the Eurydice   - Thursday, May 2nd, 1918</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://hopkinspoetry.com/poem/the-loss-of-the-eurydice/">Gerard Manley Hopkins</a>, 1918-05-02, p. ?</p>
<p>Foundered March 1878.</p>
<p>THE Eurydice–it concerned thee, O Lord:<br />
Three hundred souls, O alas! on board,<br />
Some asleep unawakened, all un-<br />
warned, eleven fathoms fallen</p>
<p>Where she foundered! One stroke<br />
Felled and furled them, the hearts of oak!<br />
And flockbells off the aerial<br />
Downs’ forefalls beat to the burial.</p>
<p>For did she pride her, freighted fully, on<br />
Bounden bales or a hoard of bullion?–<br />
Precious passing measure,<br />
Lads and men her lade and treasure.</p>
<p>She had come from a cruise, training seamen–<br />
Men, boldboys soon to be men:<br />
Must it, worst weather,<br />
Blast bole and bloom together?</p>
<p>No Atlantic squall overwrought her<br />
Or rearing billow of the Biscay water:<br />
Home was hard at hand<br />
And the blow bore from land.</p>
<p>And you were a liar, O blue March day.<br />
Bright sun lanced fire in the heavenly bay;<br />
But what black Boreas wrecked her? he<br />
Came equipped, deadly-electric,</p>
<p>A beetling baldbright cloud thorough England<br />
Riding: there did storms not mingle? and<br />
Hailropes hustle and grind their<br />
Heavengravel? wolfsnow, worlds of it, wind there?</p>
<p>Now Carisbrook keep goes under in gloom;<br />
Now it overvaults Appledurcombe;<br />
Now near by Ventnor town<br />
It hurls, hurls off Boniface Down.</p>
<p>Too proud, too proud, what a press she bore!<br />
Royal, and all her royals wore.<br />
Sharp with her, shorten sail!<br />
Too late; lost; gone with the gale.</p>
<p>This was that fell capsize,<br />
As half she had righted and hoped to rise<br />
Death teeming in by her portholes<br />
Raced down decks, round messes of mortals.</p>
<p>Then a lurch forward, frigate and men;<br />
‘All hands for themselves’ the cry ran then;<br />
But she who had housed them thither<br />
Was around them, bound them or wound them with her.</p>
<p>Marcus Hare, high her captain,<br />
Kept to her–care-drowned and wrapped in<br />
Cheer’s death, would follow<br />
His charge through the champ-white water-in-a-wallow.</p>
<p>All under Channel to bury in a beach her<br />
Cheeks: Right, rude of feature,<br />
He thought he heard say<br />
‘Her commander! and thou too, and thou this way.’</p>
<p>It is even seen, time’s something server,<br />
In mankind’s medley a duty-swerver,<br />
At downright ‘No or yes?’<br />
Doffs all, drives full for righteousness.</p>
<p>Sydney Fletcher, Bristol-bred,<br />
(Low lie his mates now on watery bed)<br />
Takes to the seas and snows<br />
As sheer down the ship goes.</p>
<p>Now her afterdraught gullies him too down;<br />
Now he wrings for breath with the deathgush brown;<br />
Till a lifebelt and God’s will<br />
Lend him a lift from the sea-swill.</p>
<p>Now he shoots short up to the round air;<br />
Now he gasps, now he gazes everywhere;<br />
But his eye no cliff, no coast or<br />
Mark makes in the rivelling snowstorm.</p>
<p>Him, after an hour of wintry waves,<br />
A schooner sights, with another, and saves,<br />
And he boards her in Oh! such joy<br />
He has lost count what came next, poor boy.–</p>
<p>They say who saw one sea-corpse cold<br />
He was all of lovely manly mould,<br />
Every inch a tar,<br />
Of the best we boast our sailors are.</p>
<p>Look, foot to forelock, how all things suit! he<br />
Is strung by duty, is strained to beauty,<br />
And brown-as-dawning-skinned<br />
With brine and shine and whirling wind.</p>
<p>O his nimble finger, his gnarled grip!<br />
Leagues, leagues of seamanship<br />
Slumber in these forsaken<br />
Bones, this sinew, and will not waken.</p>
<p>He was but one like thousands more,<br />
Day and night I deplore<br />
My people and born own nation,<br />
Fast foundering own generation,</p>
<p>I might let bygones be–our curse<br />
Of ruinous shrine no hand or, worse,<br />
Robbery’s hand is busy to<br />
Dress, hoar-hallowèd shrines unvisited;</p>
<p>Only the breathing temple and fleet<br />
Life, this wildworth blown so sweet,<br />
These daredeaths, ay this crew, in<br />
Unchrist, all rolled in ruin–</p>
<p>Deeply surely I need to deplore it,<br />
Wondering why my master bore it,<br />
The riving off that race<br />
So at home, time was, to his truth and grace</p>
<p>That a starlight-wender of ours would say<br />
The marvellous Milk was Walsingham Way<br />
And one–but let be, let be:<br />
More, more than was will yet be.–</p>
<p>O well wept, mother have lost son;<br />
Wept, wife; wept, sweetheart would be one:<br />
Though grief yield them no good<br />
Yet shed what tears sad truelove should.</p>
<p>But to Christ lord of thunder<br />
Crouch; lay knee by earth low under:<br />
‘Holiest, loveliest, bravest,<br />
Save my hero, O Hero savest.</p>
<p>And the prayer thou hearst me making<br />
Have, at the awful overtaking,<br />
Heard; have heard and granted<br />
Grace that day grace was wanted.’</p>
<p>Not that hell knows redeeming,<br />
But for souls sunk in seeming<br />
Fresh, till doomfire burn all,<br />
Prayer shall fetch pity eternal.</p>
