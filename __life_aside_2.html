<p>We have already seen how developments were taking place in Sandown in 1878, such as the opening of the pier, even as the Eurydice lay in Sandown Bay.</p>
<p>As the hulk of the ship was moved into St. Helen’s Roads, we also find that the developments were happening there around the same time, works that would change the outline of the Island on a map in an even more significant way than the addition of a pier.</p>
<p>Over the coming years, the area around Bembridge and St Helens would change signicantly, the result works that were in full swing in 1878.</p>

<p>The first inklings of what were to come appeared in 1864 with the adoption of <em>The Bembridge Railway, Tramway, and Pier Act, 1864</em>, weer ranyone to be paying attention to the matter.</p>

<p>Recites that the making of a Railiway from the authorised Line of Railway from Ryde to Lower Shanklin, near Yar Bridge, to Bembridge Point, with a Pier or Landing Place there, and a Tramway from the said intended Railway to Bembridge Down, all in the Parish of Brading in the Isle of Wight and County of Southampton, would be of great public and local Advantage; that cerrtain flooded and uninclosed and Waste Lands on the Shore of the Sea in Brading Harbour, and adjoining or near the proposed Railway, which are in the present State incapable of Cultivation, may, by reason of the Works of the Railway, be conveniently reclaimed, and it is expedient that Powers should be given for the Reclamation and Improvement of the same; and that the Company and the Isle of Wight Railway Company should be empowered to enter into Contracts and Arrangements as herin-after provided.</p>

<p>We would call the attention of the inhabitants of Brading to a report lower down with reference to their harbour. It seems that no one examined the Act of Parliament obtained by the new company, and if the inhabitants do not look out they will find bye-and-bye that they will have no harbour at all, which would indeed be a calamity.</p>
</div>
<p>As some local inhabitants started to realise what might be involved, a public meeting was called; but was it already too late to stop the development?</p>

<p>BRADING HARBOUR</p>
<p>In accordance with a requisition, a public meeting was convened by the Rev. John Le Mesurier (vicar), and churchwardens, in the girls’ school-room, Bembridge, to consider the best means of preserving rights and privileges of the inhabitants of Bembridge in respect to Brading Harbour. The Rev. J. le Mesurier occupied the chair, and the meeting was well-represented by all classes more or less interested ia the harbour.</p>
<p>The first called upon Capt. John Douglas McDonald, R.N., who was the means of gettiag the requisition signed for convening the meeting.</p>
<p>Captain MCDONALD commenced by raying theta did not wish to put himself prominently forward on this question, but by pure accident it came to his knowledge that they were being defrauded out of their rights and privileges in the Brading Harbour. They were specially indebttd to a friend in London to whom he wrote for information. All the replies in  answer to letters were to the effect that they were too late. He did not wish to be done, however, so he started a letter off at once to the authorities, which he would read later on. In the first place all this had arisen from the negligence of that parish in not attending to what was in print prior to 1874. He thought everyone was taken in by the heading “to get an Act of Parliament for the improvment of Brading Harbour and works attached.’ Not to start under any wrong impression, he did not think there was anyone present who did not wish to see a railway or good road—(hear, hear),—or an improvment to the harbour, and would not mind paying a little toll, but they would all like to have some part of the beach left to them as a public right of way. This the company had obtained, and it was now actual law, and, as far as he could understand, they could not move anywhere on the beach without paying a toll. He, for one, wished to live in Bembridge for some years to come, and would not put up with that without a struggle, and he hoped they would all join in using lawful means to avert such a thing. The the tolls they would have to pay, if the Act was allowed to proceed, would be more than the public taxes in any part of the Kingdom. Feeling this very deeply he wrote officially to the Board of Trade and to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. He had been in correspondence with a friend in town for some time before that. The letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty was to the following effect :—</p>
<p>I beg to call the attention of their Lordships to he above-named Act, which has given full power to a company to enclose the harbour now existing at Bembridge, or, at least, to reduce its proportions as to render it of little service. When I state from the best authority that over 655 vessels of the usual coasting craft, carrying coals, timber, &amp;c., entered the harbour during the year 1876, of which number about 600 discharged their cargo at the quay at Brading, the rest either at St. Helen’s or here, you can form some estimate of the value of Brading Harbour as it now exists. Moreover, it is the resort of all the pilot vessels, fishing craft, small yachts, &amp;c., in this locality, most of whom have moorings laid down in the bight of the harbour. Also numerous yachts are in the habit of being laid up here for the winter. Under the above state of the case I trust their Lordships will hesitate to give their sanction to clause 38 contained in the said Act, without a full and complete inquiry into the merits of the case.</p>
<p>A similar letter was sent to the Board of Trade, and the following was their reply :—</p>
<p>I am directed by the Board of trade to acknoledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ult., on the subject of tho works which the Brading Harbour Improvement and Pier Company propose to construct inn Brading Haven, in pursuance of the authority conferred upon them by the above Act. In reply. I am to point out, as indeed your letter admits, that Parliament has authorised the construction of the embankment to which you object. It has further, by the 38th section at the Act to which you call attention, conferred on the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the duty of approving of the working drawings, and I am to observe that is it obvious that the Board of Trade have no power to repeal or alter an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>They had not got a reply from the Admiralty, but they would hear that that was going on all right, and that it was their sheet anchor. With reference to the reply from the Board of Trade, he would say they ought not to have signed away the  public right of water. The speaker then quoted from “Phear” on the rights of water. This harbour, fortunately for them, happened to be under the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, and was enclosed in the plan furnished to the authorities at Portsmouth. No shingle could be taken away without their permissionm and their rights extended up to Brading. HE wanted them now to select a committee to act in the matter.</p>
<p>Captain John Macdonald, R.N., then explained the differnce between the original and amended plan, and it was clearly shown that if carried out Brading Harbout would be a harbout of refuge no longer.</p>
<p>Different sections of the Act were then read, including schedule of charges.</p>
<p>Mr de Pass next addressed the meeting, and on one or two points he differed from the previous speaker. He argued that it would be of no use for them to endeavour to upset the whole Act of Parliament, but they should bring all their forces to bear to keep the company to their first plan. The difference between the first and second plan was in having a harbour for vessels or having no harbour. (Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>Captain McDonald said he quite agreed with regard to the old plen, but there was one one thing they had forgotten—that was about the tolls which could be levied even when the old plans were completed. It had been an open place in the harbour from time immemorial, and as long as he could stir a hand in the matter a toll should not be paid unless the people had a place to land their boats. (Hear, hear.) If they had a harbour they wanted a free one. (Appllause.) If the choice was between a harbour and a railway he would rather have the harbour. If the harbour was shut up where were the fishermen, &amp;c., to get their bait. (Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>Mr. de Pass: Two plans had been deposited. The first plan might hare been opposed successfully and there would have been an end to it. Now the company had deposited a second, which meant to shut up the harbour entirely, which would be great oppression. The original Act was named the “Bembridge Improvement Act”. The people of Bembridge went to sleep—(laughter)—and did not go to Brading to see the Act. The Act was passed for the improvement of Bembridge, and they believed it to be an improvement till their eyes were opened, and saw that this little part of their rights was being taken away. Bembridge Harbour was free, and if the people of Brading liked to allow their harbor to be shut up, it was their affair, but he did not think they would allow it. He did not think it could be closed up by the signature of any party unless it was proved that no real good could accrue to Bembridge without destroying the harbour. He afterwards referred to the tolls, and argued that they would be obliged to come down as the public would not patronise the company.</p>
<p>Captain McDonlaod said that according to the plans they were not allowed the smallest portion as being free.</p>
<p>Captain Clayton advocated forming a committee at once, which wasaccordingly done, consisting of the following:— Captain McDonald, Captain Clayton, Messrs. T. E. Osborn, Searl, W. W. Osborne, Mursell, Weaver, Damp and Jones.</p>
<p>The meeting then broke up.</p>
</div>
<p>As the Hampshire Advertiser observed, reaching Bembridge had until now been hampered by the lack of direct access to it from places such as Ryde, so the development would, udoubtedly, bring some benefits if access could be improved.</p>

<p>” Improvements.” — Anyone who has visited this part of the Island, and noticed the beautiful sandy beach, the picturesque sea and land views, and the healthy climate, must have felt some little surprise that it has not been so well frequented as other places. Its beauties and advantages have at last been discovered, however, and, as with the rest of the Island, things are looking up here. The chief reason which haa prevented Bembridge from being oftener visited has been the fact of it being rather difficult of access. Although only a short distance from Ryde there is no getting a carriage there, unless one goes round the harbour, whioh adds several miles to the journey. If a carriage is taken to St. Helen’s, it has to be left there, and passengers are ferried over in small boats for 1d. The harbour here is of considerable width, and the channel of some depth, but an unfortunate bar across its mouth has prevented it being useful to large vessels, though yachts, barges, &amp;c., find no difficulty in navigating it, and no less than 655 coasting craft, carrying coal, timber, &amp;c., entered the harbour in 1876, and 600 discharged cargoes at Brading. This being the case, the inhabitants naturally wish to preserve the harbour, though desirous, at the same time, of seeing as many improvements carried out as possible. The great improvement ia a projected railway, and, while welcoming it on one account as likely to benefit them, they are strongly opposed to the company, who have obtained powers to improve the harbour as well aa make a railway, and they propose a scale of tolls, at which the inhabitants are highly indignant. No vessels could come in without a toll, aod all the old rights and privileges of the fishermen will be gone for ever. Although the Act of the company has actually passed, Captain McDonald, R.N., has taken an active part in calling attention to its provisions, and has written to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Board of Trade, but hitherto without a favourable reply. This gentleman was instrumental in calling a public meeting of the inhabitants last week, when it was clearly shown that the company had trenched coniderably upon their original plans, and that the harbour would no longer be free if they carried out all that was intended. A committee, consisting of the following gentleman, was appointed to do what they could to preserve the rights of the inhabitants : — Captain McDonald, Capt Clayton, Messrs. T. E. Osborn, Searl, W. Osborn, Morsell, Weaver, Damp, and Jones.</p>
</div>
<p>Presumably despite the committee’s best efforts, work towards the reclamation was begun, the activity prompting various brief histories of an earlier attempt to reclaim the same land to appear.</p>

<p>Reclamation of Mudlands at Brading Harbour.</p>
<p>Brading Harbour, although a pretty sheet of water at high tide, presents nothing but a vast expanse of mud flats when tbe water is out, and the channel, which runs between them to Brading quay, is very intricate. Nowhere does the water flow over the mud flats more than two or three feet, and nothing is easier tban for a vessel to get aground in making her way up the harbour. The celebrated Hugh Middleton, the engineer who did so much for the water supply of London, as long ago as the 17th century, is said to have conceived the idea of reclaiming these mud flats, and converting them into arable land, but owing to tbe defective engineering appliances of those days, he did net succeed, and old inhabitants of St. Helen’s say that wood work aid other relics of his attempt existed till quite recently. A company has been formed with much the same object in view as Hugh Middleton, with the addition of a railway. They are now actively at work, and have already reclaimed a plot of land at Bembridge, which will be converted into a railway station. An embankment is now being constructed across tbe harbour to shut out the sea, and thus reclaim about 800 acres of land. A large quay will be made at St. Helen’s Mill, where goods will be landed and carried by railway to Brading. instead of being taken by boats. The entrance to the harbour will also be improved, so that vessels of larger burden can enter. A railway is now in course of construction for the conveyance of passengers to Bembridge and St. Helen’s. As both these are pretty places, and possess a good beach, there seems every probability that they will, ere long, become watering places of importance.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">THE RECLAMATION OF BRADING HAVEN. - Saturday, November 3rd, 1877</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000495/18771103/004/0002">Hampshire Advertiser</a>, 1877-11-03, p. 1</p>
<p>It may not be uninteresting to many of our Isle of Wight readers, now that the reclamation of Brading Harbour is a work in progress, to know that such a work was attempted so far back as 1616, by Sir Hugh Myddleton, whose successful enterprise in connection with the New River Company has given him enduring fame. Smiles, in his ” Lives of Engineers,” refers to this work, and says that it is probable ” that, at some early period, neither swamp nor lake existed at Brading Haven, but a green and fertile valley, for in the course of tbe works undertaken by Sir Hugh for its recovery from the sea, a well, strongly cased with stone, was discovered near the middle of the Haven, indicating tbe existence of a former settled pppulation on the soil. The sea must, however, have burst in and destroyed the settlement, layiug the whole valley under water. In King James’s reign, when the recovering of drowned lands began to receive an unusual degree of attention, the project of reclaiming Brading Haven was again revived; and in the year 1616 a grant was made of the drowned lands to one John Gibb, the King reserving to himself a rental of £20 per annum •• • It appears that Gibb sold his right to one Sir Bevis Thelwall, who at once invited Sir Hugh Myddleton to join him in undertaking the work. • • • A satisfactory arrangement having been made with the King, Myddleton began tne work of reclaiming the Haven in the course of tbe same year (1620). He sent to Holland for Dutch workmen, familiar with such undertakings, and it is obvious that be mainly followed the Dutch method of reclamation, although it would also appear that be also employed some invention of his own. No description is given of the paiticular method a opted by Sir Hugh in forming his embankment, but it would appear that he proceeded by driving piles into the bottom oi the Haven, near Bembridge Point, where it is about the narrowest, and thus formed a strong embankment at its junction with the sea, but, as would appear, without making adequate provision for the egress of the inland waters.”</p>
<p>A very curious contemporary manuscript by Sir John Oglander, is still preserved amongst the archives of the Oglander family, who hold a great part of the ueighbounng land, from which it would appear that after the ground was recovered, it was not of much value. The best portion was that nearest Brading ; 200 acres were worth about 6s 8d the acre, and all the rest about 2s 6d the acre (!). Wheat, barley, cabbage, and oats, all failed to grow on it ; but rape succeeded best ; all the others came to nothing. At last, on the 8th of May, 1630, there came a very high spring tide, when the sea made a breach, and, not being attended to soon euougb, got worse and worse, till at last it was all covered again with the sea. The total amount lost in the attempt is said to be about £7000. The manuscript referred to further says that though the country people were much against the reclamation of the harbour, yet it ” caused a great deal more health in tbese parts than was ever known before.” The gates whioh served for a sluice were dug up some years ago near the boatbouse on St. Helen’s, ” Duvver.”</p>

<p>On Saturday last the men engaged on these works were entertained at dinner by employer, Mr. F. Seymour, as a token of his good feeling towards them for the assistance they have given him in carrying out his contract. A large iron house was erected for the occasion on Bembridge point, and most tastefully decorated. Flags of all aatioas were gracefully draped around the walls, running from end to end of the building, while handsome mottoes, expressing welcome and good will to the men, were plentiful. At intervals, showing out between the flags, were stars formed of new shovels and pick-axes, and from the ceiliug hung a battered old navvy’s barrow, a true emblem of hard work.</p>
<p>The chair was occupied by Mr. Frederick Seymour, with the Rev. Le Mesurier on the right, and the vice-chair by Mr. Pinchbeck. Three hundred of the <em>employes</em> and men sat down to an excellent dinner, beautifully served up, and entirely cooked by the men. The scene was most imposing, the tables admirably laid, and everything of the best provided, while choice flowers ornamented the dessert. More surprising was the manner in which the several dishes were served up and cooked owing to the difficulty of finding cooking accommodation. — Grace having been said by the Rev. J. Le Mesurier, Mr. Seymour proposed the health of the Queen, the Royal Family, and the Army and Navy, which toast he felt sure would be heartily responded to, especially as owing to the unsettled state of affairs in the East nobody could tell when the service ot the latter might be required, and he felt sure that with men of the physique those present, her Majesty’s &amp;dominions were in safe keeping.—The toast was received with hearty cheers, showing that everyone present believed in maintaining the prestige of the mother country.—In the absence of any military or naval guest, Mr. Le Mesurier kindly returned thanks, and then addressed the men, complimenting them on their excellent conduct hitherto, and saying he should always he happy to assist any individual of their number with his advice. Order re-established, and the men’s glasses having been filled with wine, Mr. Seymour mild: Brother working men, I wish to propose a toast which I feel sure you will receive with hearty good-will, and that is the health of the Bradiiig Harbour Company, and their Chairman, Mr. Spencer Balfour, for you must not forget it is owing to them that we are met today in this friendly way ; you must also recollect that although every week you look to me for your wages, I have to look to them for the necessary funds to carry out this great undertaking, which have always been forthomniug. In all our undertakings through life we dependent on each other, and it is union which gives strength. In your case you depend on the contractor, the contractor on his company, who find the money, and when that fails we are the same as a without its main spring. I also take this opportunity of thanking you sincerely for the assistence you have given, and to one and all I am greatly obliged. I compliment you on your good behaviour during the time you have been is my employ; you have had to work under the most trying circumstances. and have had great difficulties to contend against, as must naturally be expected when dealing with the elements, but I must say you have done your duty like men, and if, by God’s will, I am enabled to bring this undertaking to a satiafacitory result, I hope you will do me the honour of dining with me again ; and I must also thank my worthy friend at the emd of the table, Mr. Pinchbeck, for the able assistance he has given me, and rest assured, men, he is your best friend. I must also thank the members of the committee for the great trouble they have taken in choosing these pretty decorations, and for the great skill they have shown in providing the good dinner they have enabled me to put before you; and now, my men, I know you want to get to Portsmouth, so I will not detain you, I wish you all a very merry Christmas, and many happy new years. and I trust that many of them will be spent in my employ.</p>
<p>Mr. Pinchbeck then proposed “The health of Mr. Seymour,” in appropriate terms, which was received with tremendous cheering, a salute of guns outside, and the chorus, joined in by all with great gusto, of “He’s a jolly good fellow.”</p>
<p>An excellent song having been given by one of the men, the pleasant meeting broke up. A steam launch was in readiness to convey the men to Portsmouth, where the majority go every Saturday.</p>

<p>Captain J. W. D. McDonald, retired captain, R.N., has addressed the following letter to the Shipping and Mercantila Gazette :—” I forward herewith copies of letters, &amp;., referring to works now being carried out in Brading Harbour, and feel assured that, after a careful study of the metier, you will agree with me that it is quite time there should be some understanding as to what department has the power of controlling or preventing injury to the public rights, as involved in the conservancy of harbours, as well as the preservation of foreshores, &amp;c. At present the result of my experience in the matter leads me to believe that the authorities do not quite understaud what power they have, or where it begins and ends. I may possibly be wrong in the conclusion arrived at, but, to my judgment of the case, it seems a matter of surprise that, although I have been (as you will see by the correspondence) in constant communication with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, as well as the Board of Trade, yet the fact remains, that the Brading Harbour Company may do what they like, without any step being taken by the authorities to put a stop to their encroachments. Surely there should be some sort of supervision over works of this nature. There should be a public functionary to visit and report from time to time as to how the works are progressing, and that they do not exceed the powers granted by the original Act. It most at ought not to be left to a private individual to have to keep up a constant attack on the parties who are paid for and invested with the duties of this particular department. If a coastguardsman sees a fisherman or other person take up a piece of plank or spar washed up on the beach, and carry it away, the individual is informed that he has no right to it, but that it must be deposited in the keeping of the coastguard, and he will be eutitled to a certain amount for the salvage. If he objects to leave his piece of plank or spar, and takes it off, he is liable to a fine or term of imprisonment. If the Coastguiud are invested with this power as regard wreckage or drift wood, what is to prevent their having the power to stop any parties removing shingle or sand from the sea-shore? In one case a person can be stopped for taking away a piece of timber, perhaps worth only 5s., and the other may take away thousands of tons of shingle and sand, and there is no authority to stop him from doing so. It is surely time the public should know who are the real guardians of the public rights in navigable waters, as well as those of foreshores, &amp;c. With respect to the granting of powers to a company, as in the case of the Brading Harbour Act, I venture to submit that, in future, notice of any attempt to interfere with tidal waters and navigable channels should be posted up at the Custom-houses and Coastguard Stations within a radius of 30 or 40 miles of the proposed alterations, so that the coasting and seafaring population may know what is proposed; also that the Coastguard officers be instructed to make inquiries as to the feeling of the inhabitants of the district, as well as to receive any remonstrance from pilots or fishermen resident in the district, such reports to be forwarded to the authorities. It is also essential that an inquiry should be instituted by qualified officers into the bearing or effect the alterations would have on Government works and national requirements. These observatious are made with the view of obtaining some certain, sure, and definite means of redress, as well as the prevention of injustice in trampling under foot the public right as involved in the question of conservancy of harbours, free navigation, and foreshores. At present, any inquisitive traveller will find our Coastguard Stations decorated with public notices about the numbering of fishing boats, concealment of wreckage, inducements to enter the Royal Navy, a long list of penalties for the infringment of Board of Trade Regulations, protection of seagulls (with penalties), treatment of the apparently drowned, and others <em>ad infinitum</em>. I should much like to see notices in some protecting the rights of the coasting and seafaring as well as the fishing communities.” Our contemporary, in a leading article, says :”The ‘Piers and Harbours Act’ does not, it is generally admitted, confer sufficient power on the Board of Trade, in the public interest, for the prevention of local abuses. Rivers and harbours should be under the control of a Government Department responsible to Parliament. To a certain extent the Board of Trade stands in an intermediary position, but its officers are not armed with the requisite authority for the defence of national rights; for we take it that navigable channels should not be arbitrarily and independently assuaged by any self-imposed body of Commissioners, however honourable they may be.”</p>

<p>As a proof of the value of an oyster fishery when properly managed the award which has just been made in this case will, we imagine, interest not only proprietors, but the oyster-loving public. It appears that the Brading Harbour Improvement Commissioners wished to take an oyster fishery in this harbour which Major Boyle had purchased and worked since 1871. To this, of course, the Major, who has devoted nearly the whole of his time to the cultivation of the oyster at these ponds since he purchased them, objected, unless he received what he considered a fair compensation. This was a matter on which there was a very great difference of opinion, and to decide the point it was agreed to refer it to arbitration. Mr. J. H. Chatton was agreed on as the umpire, with Mr. Gann as his asseoser, the arbitrators being Mr. H. D. Martin Ind Mr. R. C. Driver. Major Boyle had obtained the assistance of Mr. J. Binfield Bird. surveyor, of Cowes, who has for many years practically studied the question of oyster culture, and on whose valuation the case was opened. He had also the valuation of Capt. Johnson, the manager of the Medina and Newtown River Oyster Fishery Company.—The case was opened by Mr. J. W. Fardell, solicitor, of Ryde, who gave an account of the fishery from its commencement, after which Major Boyle was examined. He said that seven years ago he became interested in the Company, and eventually he bought them out, as they had paid no dividend. He then investigated the afiairs, and found that the labourers had never been paid, and that no stock of oysters had been kept on the ground. Eventually they sold the lease to him for £300, and he took it on and began to breed oysters. He bred them every year but one till the last. In 1872 they took out 450,000 oysters, and the average of deaths was about five per cent, during five years. The Major then handed in a statement of what he had purchased in each year. Last year they had had a most wonderful spat ; the wire netting, the cultch, and the bottom of the pond were covered with it. Some of it, casually picked from the pond, was here produced, and it was covered with young oysters about the size of a sixpence. If no notice bad been given him he should have kept on selling and also purchasing brood. —Edward Mursell was then examined by Mr. Fardell. He stated that he had lived on the place all his life and had to do with oysters ever since be was twelve years old. He was now 38; he dredged oysters for his father: he was in the employ of the first manager, Captain Calbach, and then Major Boyle engaged him as foreman. The old system under which he had worked did not do; but he was sure the one Major Boyle had carried out would be a success. He should think there was now about fifteen millions of young oysters in the pond, out of which they could save quite fourteen millions. In the channel all the large oysters were placed, and he should think there were quite 450,000 at the present time. It was an out-and-out growing ground. His wagns was £6O per year. Captain E. Johnson, manager of the Medina River and Newtown River Oyster Fishery, said he had been extensively engaged in the breeding of oysters. He had inspected this Oyster Fishery, and he believed there were over fifteen millions or about 280 to a square foot. He obtained from Major Boyle the number purchased and those sold, and the number stated left 485,000 in all. He believed there were quite 450,000 in the river.—Mr. Wright, on the part of the defendants, opened his case by stating that the Company were not compelled to take the oysters and they declined to do so, they not being marketable. The lease was worth nothing, the clauses being bad, and the spat was worth nothing, and the stock was overdone. He could not admit the amount for goodwill, and for a forced sale too much money was asked.—Mr. Brazier, oyster merchant from Southwick and Brightlingsea, was then called. He said he surveyed the harbour and breeding ponds. There was a large quantity of spat. He selected those he could fish up by the rake: there were only ten on a shell, on an average 250,000 might be put on the hurdles. The total amount of spat he put at 1,850,000, which at 5s. per 1,000 would be £412 10s. No. 2 pond was unfinished. He also examined the ground in the Harbour, which was 200 yards long by 120 wide. The oysters were very thin on the bottom. He took up 100 oysters and he estimated that there could not be more than 200,000, which at 50s. per 1,000 gave £500. He thought there was nothing in the business and no chance of success. Had never heard of a claim for the profit rental; 40 spat could grow on a shell. He valued the spat at £912 10s. The Fishery would never be a profitable one. His value for making ponds and all would be £1,564 5s. He counted a dozen or fourteen on an oyster shell. He was paying 7s. for channel oysters, and he had purchased 11,000 tubs at 2s. per 100. He got for them 9s., and for small channel 6s. 7d. and 8s. per 100; the spat was a splendid one.— Mr. Collard, of the Herne Bay Company, of which he is a director, said he went over the Fishery and he came to the conclusion that the value of the spat channel oysters laid down, construction of ponds, at a compulsory sale was £2,976. He had failed in artificial breeding himself. He had a sea fishery at Southdeep, and the fresh water had come down with snow water, which had killed them. It really was a very heavy spat. The laying ground was clean, and the very best he had ever seen, and he would not part with it on any account. —Cross-examined : He made out the profit, and then the goodwill. There was a market for the spat. He never saw so many oysters and so few clocks[?] on any ground. The valuations were :—For Major Boyle—Captain Johanson, £9,761 10s. ; Mr. J. Binfield Bird, £9,525. For the Company—Mr. Collard, £2,976; Mr. Brazier, £1,564. The umpires’ award is £8,000 showing that Mr. J. Bird’s valuation is taken as not far off the mark, Mr. Bird, in his report, stating that on or about the 17th of June and the 2nd of July a wonderful fall of spat had appeared, prior to which the pond had been most carefully prepared, and 12,000 parent oysters placed in it: 800 yards of wire netting was arranged, and 800,000 oyster shells placed on the top. Fascines, hurdles, tiles, slates, and clean shingle were also provided, and the result is thet the whole is literally covered with spat, many single oyster-shells having 50 on each, and although from the immense number it is impossible to form a correct idea of the quantity, yet he considedered 15 millions would be a low estimate. Major Boyle may congratulate himself on the success in breeding the oyster, and Mr. Bird on his so successfully and admirably valuing an exceedingly difficult property.</p>

<p>English Oyster Breeding.— Mr. Howard Martin, Surveyor to the Brading Harbour Improvement and Railway Company, writes as follows from 145, High-street, Croydon ; — ” In the present condition of the oyster trade and the breeding of oysters in Great Britain it may interest your readers to hear that for the second year in succession a ‘ fall of spat ‘ of a very remarkable character has taken place in the oyster-breeding ponds in Brading Harbour, Isle of Wisrht. In one of the ponds, about 3 1/4 acres in extent, the collectors placed to receive the spat throughout the pond are covered with the minute oysters, and an adjoining pond, about 2 acres in area, contains nearly as many in proportion. It is impossible to estimate the number with any accuracy, but there must be many millions in the two ponds. The fall of last year in a third pond (when the fishery was in the hands of Major Boyle, the then lessee) was nearly as large in proportion, as this greater success following it gives ground for the hope that, in places as favourably situated as the Brading Harbour fisheries, the breeding of oysters in enclosed ponds on the English coast will become, in the hands of those who follow right methods, a business with at least no more than that ordinary business risk of failure which every breeder of any kind of live stock must incur. The importance to the food supply of the nation of a solution of the problems involved in breeding oysters in England in enclosed ponds is sufficient, I think, to be my apology for this communication. I shall be pleased to allow any of your readers who take an interest in the matter to see the spat.”</p>

<p>The usual monthly meeting of this Club was held on Wednesday evening, the President, Dr. A. Carpenter, in the chair. There was tolerably good attendance of members. …</p>
<p>The President then called upon Mr. Howard Martin read a paper on<br />
OYSTER BREEDING.”</p>
<p>Mr. Martin, after a few preliminary explanations, said—The great scarcity and consequent hight price of oysters during the last feew years, has strongly attracted the public notice to the causes of the scarcity, and the the various means by which some of these causes might be remedied. One such cause, no doubt, has been the comparative failure, in many places for several years in succession, of oyster breeding, and there is reason to believe that the deficiency of the natural breeding placesmay be, to a great extent, supplied by artificially enclosed ponds prepared for the purpose, in which the parent oysters may breed, and the “spat”, or young oysters may be exposed from some of the dangers which prove fatal to them elsewhere. Some authorities on the subject believe the source of supply cannot be calculated upon with certainty in this country, but there are grounds for a more hopeful opinion. No created being probably appears to the unscientific eye more plain and straightforwards and less complicated than an oyster, and probably there is no living thing more a matter of controversy. It is said that whilst oysters have the most extraordinary powers of reproduction— one oyster emitting at one spatting nearly two millions of the embryo oysters— a very high temperature is essential to raise the development of the “spat,” and owing to our summers having been, for many successive years, decidedly cooler than the summers of the good old days when oysters were cheap and plentifiul, the annual crop of young oysters has failed us, and will not be resotred until we get once more a succession of old-fashioned summers. The balance of evidence does not appear to me to support so gloomy a view. There is no dount that a combination of favourable conditions is necessary to secure the life and development of oyster spat, and that unusually low temperatures, while it is floating or near the time of its attachment, will probably kill it; but it is by no means proved, on the other hand, that a very high temperature will ensure the life of the spat, or that it may not be emitted and thrive at a very moderate temperature. (After quoting authorities Mr. Martin continued)— It appears, therefore, that our summers are still hot enough for oyster breeding if we can secure other necessary conditions, either by the protection of the parent oysters in the spat in enclosed ponds, or by giving the parents a fair chance of breeding in their natural beds— a chance which, in many cases, has been denied them. There have been many inatances of natural beds having been to greedily dredged to be actually destroyed entirely; and many where the removal, for sale, of oysters of all ages and at all seasons has so diminshed the beds as to render them worthless. It is said, too, that when no ” close time” was enforced on the public oyster beds, oysters were frequently dredged for sale when about to spat, and emitted their spat in great quantities on the decks of the boats in which they were removed, thus wasting what might have developed into many millions of oysters. It to such causes as these—to short-sighted selfishness which “kills the goose that lays the golden eggs” all the world over, and does not rest until it renders extinct every valuable animal on which it to allowed to work its wicked will, that it seems to me, we must look for the causes of the scarcity of the oyster, and not to any unconrrollable alterate in the temperature of our planet or our country, even if such alteration really exists. The breeding places of the oyster are divided into four classes, namely:—(1.) Entirely natural beds, situated generally more or less in the open sea, such as those in the Bristol and British Channels, or in the North Sea, where work to done to protect or assist the reproduction the oysters. (2.) Natural beds, (such as those in the various creeks and bays the coast of Essex and Kent,) where breeding is associated by what is called “cultivating,.” i.e. the clearing of the ground from mud, weeds, and the living enemies of the oyster, and the laying down of sheds (or cultch it to called) and other suitable collectors to which the spat can attach itself. (3.) Foreshores on which collectors various kinds are placed to receive spat washed to them by the tides, from natural or partly natural beds in the vicinity, such those at Ré Oléron, Archacon, and other places in France. (4.) Enclosed ponds, in which the parent oysters are placed to spat, and in which the spat is allowed to remain until it is large enough for removal to the ordinary laying grounds, such those at Brading, Cowes, Hayling Island, and elsewhere. As has been remarked before, the supply from the natural and partly natural breeding places has diminished considerably during the last few years, and the use of artificial breeding places has been too recently introduced, and not sufficiently successful, (in this country, at any rate) to affect the supply; but there is good reason to hope that in the future it may come to be a very valuable addition to the natural sources. Oysters are hermaphrodites, and it is now pretty well established by microscopic observations, that they are self-impregnating. Indeed, apart from the evidence of the microscope, the probabilities of the case incline decidedly to that view. Oyster-beds are, in most cases, exposed to the action of the wind and of strong tidal currents ; and it is difficult to believe that spermatozoa could be carried by the action of the water (and they must necessarily be so carried if oysters be not self-impregnating) from one oyster into the other, with sufficient certainty to secure the regular and certain impregnation which undoubtedly occurs. Oysters are said to have been known to spat when between one or two years old, and there is no doubt that they frequently do so between the ages of two and three years. The time of spatting varies, according to the season and situation of the oyster beds, from May to September; but June and July are probably the months in which spatting most usually takes place. After describing the development of the spat, and its preference for certain kinds of “collectors”, Mr. Martin said he had been unable form any idea as to how long the spat floated in freedom. During the time the spat is floating, great quantities are eaten by shrimps and small fish, and carried by the currents or the action of the wind to places where, finding suitable surfaces to which to attach itself, it perishes, or where its attachment is of no benefit to the owners of the bed from which it started ; sudden and considerable fall of temperature may oftenkill nearly the whole of it while it is floating. When the young oyster is securely anchored, however, its dangers are not all passed. The human preference for oysters, as an article of food, is shared by crabs, starfish, and whelks. In addition to their living enemies oysters are, in some fisheries, frequently killed by sand or mud accumulating above them, or the chilling the water in which they lie by the passage of melted snow over the beds in times of thaw. It is not astonishing, therefore, that the natural productiveness of the oyster—great as it undoubtedly is—is not sufficient to meet the enormous demand made upon it for the supply of the markets, unless in the first instance the reproductive powers of the parents are allowed fair play by the enforcing of proper restrictions on their removal from breeding places, and in the second, great care be bestowed on the protection of the growing oysters when the parents have produced them. Having referred to the fishing grounds Hayling Island, and Brading Harbour, Mr. Martin said that when ponds were first laid out for breeding oysters, it appears to have been almost universally believed that the great essential to success was to obtain ” heat end tranquility” in the ponds, and jealously close every aperture by which water could escape from them, lest the floating spat should escape with it. The ponds were, in some instances, made shallow to secure the raising of the water in them to higher temperature, and in various ways much trouble and money were expended in endeavouring to secure these supposed necessary conditions of success. But success was not often the result. In some cases the parent oysters spatted prematurely, and the spat never appeared to live at all. In some cases, it lived a short time, but failed to attach itself to the collectors, and success appeared to be the exception rather than the rule. Mr. Martin concluded interesting paper by minutely describing the plan of operations carried on at Brading Harbour from his own observation.</p>
<p>Mr.Lee thanked Mr. Martin for his valuable paper, which contained so much uaeful matter, the result of thoughtful research, and suggested that the paper should be printed <em>in extenso</em>, as it would be exceedingly useful for future reference.</p>
<p>A formal vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Martin for hit excellent paper, and it was resolved that it should be printed <em>in extenso</em>. Mr. Martin exhibited a model of breeding ponds, and photographs of same: The President exhibited a large collection of fossil oysters, and other specimens; Mr. H. Lee specimens of oysters; and Mr. J. S. Johnson, Mr. F. Crowley, and Mr. H. Turner, placed their microscopes at Mr. Martin’s disposal.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">RYDE COUNTY COURT. - Saturday, March 8th, 1879</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790308/007/0005">Isle of Wight Observer</a>, 1879-03-08, p. 5</p>
<p>A sitting of this Court was held on Wednesday, at the Town Hall, before P. M. Leonard, Esq., judge, when the cause list was unusually heavy, and his Honour sat from ten in the morning till nearly eight at night without finishing the cases, the most important of which were as follows :</p>
<p>John Jacobs v. The Isle of Wight Railway Company. —The plaintiff in this case, who is a working fore-man to the Executors of Col. Hargreaves, coal merchants, at Brading, claimed £50 from the Isle of Wight Railway for injuries sustained by him in consequence of the alleged negligence of the company’s servants. Mr. Feltham, solicitor, of Portsmouth, appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, and Mr. John W. Fardell, of Ryde, for the defendants.</p>
<p>Mr. Feltham having briefly opened the case, called The plaintiff, who deposed that he was working foreman in the employ of the Executors of Col. Hargreaves. On the 30th of July last he was on land belonging to defendant company at the quay at Brading. He was expecting three barges in with coal from Southampton. He saw one barge coming to the quay and, thinking that it was for his company, he went to see what it was. It was part of his business to go to the barges as they arrived, examine the coal, and to make arrangements for its discharge. The barges had not arrived, but they came directly afterwards and he was waiting, as he saw them coming up the harbour, till they arrived. At that time there were some trucks upon the harbour works. The works were being carried out by the Brading Harbour Improvement Company and the lines of Isle of Wight RaUway Company were connected by a bridge, but at that time the bridge was not strong enough to bear the weight of an engine, so that the trucks were shunted or pushed on the bridge by an engine, and allowed to run over the bridge and down to the quay. He was with a Mr. Dawes at the time, who as they were standing by the side of the line saw the trucks coming down. Mr. Dawes asked what they should do, and witness said the ouly course open to them was to step on one side, for the trucks were coming with such rapidity that there was no time to run. If they had attempted to run they would have come over them. The width of the siding was about 4ft. There were several skips (iron buckets used to unload gravel) at the side, and the trucks would have cleared witness and the skips too if the clap of the trucks had been properly fastened up. The clap of the fourth truck as well (as several others) was down, and the consequence was that the clap came in collision with the skip, the skip knocked against witness, and knocked him down the quay into the water. Mr. Dawe was standing beside him and they both went over into the water together. The water was out of his depth. He heard no one shout to him to get out of the way, and assuming that they did there was no time for him to do so. He should have been obliged to run a hundred yards to have done so. He therefore thought it best to stop where he was. The trucks were not in charge of any one at the time. The engine sent the trucks over at full speed. They were obliged to go at a tremendous speed to get them up the incline, and they came into the yard with great impetus. He did not know whose duty it was to put up the claps of the trucks of the engine. The accident was caused solely by the claps being down. The blow he received quite disabled him for a long time. He was obliged to go about his work on crutches and have a carriage to take him to and from his home. He could do nothing but direct the other men as to what they were to do and keep the account. Before the accident he was able to do a good day’s work as well as any one in the yard, but since he had not been able to carry a sack of coals. He was three months under the doctor’s hands. He still suffered great pain. — Cross-examined by Mr. Fardell : I have known the quay about ten years and a half. The jetty ran a considerable way into the sea before these new works were commenctd. The Brading Harbour Improvement Company were constructing works to connect their works with the Isle of Wight Railway, and the trucks which caused this damage were started from the works of the Brading Harbour Company. I do not know whose engine it was started the trucks. I should not have stayed where I was if I could have got away. Many men have stood there before and since. I deny positively that I was warned against going on the works by any one. I did not hear any one call out to warn me. I did not hear the engine whistle. If I did I did not understand it was a warning to get out of the way. When I was knocked into the water a man named Charles Simmonds was very close to me, but he did not try to save me. I struggled to a post as well as I could and begged them to help me out because I felt I was fainting. When I got out a man named Stickley never said, ” If you had listened to me this would never have happened, and I never said “I am quite aware of that.” That I swear. I know Mr. Jones, but I am not aware of any conversation in which he said ” You had no business there, and if you had listened to me this would never have happened.” I never replied ” I know I was wrong. I cold see danger ; but I could not get out of the way.” There was a break truck but no one with it. There was no one in the trucks. I know the skip struck me first, and that I and Mr. Dawes both went over together.</p>
<p>Mr. Fardell said the question was one of liability, aud he should prove that the engine that pushed the trucks along belonged to the Brading Harbour works.</p>
<p>Cross-examination continued : I went to work the next day. I was not expected to work but only to look after the other men. I have not hindered any time, and my master has been kind enough to pay the same wages as I had before. Dr. Bulbeck attended me, and I authorised him to ask for £20 damages on my behalf [A letter was read from Dr. Bulbeck written on behalf of plaintiff.]</p>
<p>By Mr. Feltham.— I repeat I did not get any warning from anybody. There was no time for me to effect my escape. The trucks were coming at the rate of 20 miles an hour. Mr. Dawes was nearly drowned. Simmonds handed me a stick and helped me afterwards. The skip was the property of the Isle of Wight Railway Company.</p>
<p>Mr. Daniel S. W. Dawe said that he was a chemical manure manufacturer. On the 20th of July last he was in company with the last witness about 11 o’clock. He went to see one of the bargemen on the quay. Before he got there, he saw Jacobs, and they passed the time of day, and witness made the remark that there were some barges coming up the river, and plaintiff replied ” They are very likely ours.” Witness was then at the lower end of the jetty, on the railway company’s premises. While they were standing there he saw some goods trucks move slowly towards St. Helen’s. That was in the opposite direction. Soon afterwards he happened to look round and saw the trucks a few yards behind him. Mr. Jacobs said they had better stand where they were as it would be dangerous to run, and that where they were standing was a safe place. It would have been safe if someone had done his duty and placed the claps of the trucks up. Two trucks passed safely, but the next had the clap down and it struck the iron bucket next to Jacobs, and we were both knocked into the water. The skip would not have been struck if the claps had not been down, and the position would have been safe. There was a man standing on the opposite side, but he was not hurt. Heard no one warn Mr. Jacobs. If anyone had done so he must have heard it.—Cross-examined by Mr. Fardell : Did not see anyone in charge of the train, and I do not believe there was anyone. I heard no warning. I picked up Jacobs on the jetty. I did not see Lock. I never heard Lock tell us to get out of the way. I did not hear anyone tell Jacobs not to go on the quay as there were no vessels for him. I have seen the skips on the quay before. I had no conversation with Stickley. I did not take any notice of the whistle. I did not know it was to warn people. They might have been doing it for their own amusement (laughter) . I was hurt, but I have not taken any proceedings because I had no right there.</p>
<p>Mr. John Bulbeck, surgeon, but now out of general practice, said he was called on to see the plaintiff. He found that his leg was very much injured, and he was afraid that the bone was too. Plaintiff had a good constitution, and was a teetotaller, but it took nearly three months to heal, and he must have suffered a great deal of pain. He knew him before the accident, and considered him a very strong healthy man. His bill for attending him was five guineas.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fardell. —I was at one time called in whenever Messrs. Hargreaves and Co. required my services. I wrote the letter produced. I asked for £20 for the plaintiff, and I thought that was a very fair compensation. He offered, on behalf of the plaintiff, to accept that sum if it ceuld be arranged between plaintiff and the company without further expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Fardell made a lengthy and forcible defence, his three heads being— 1st. That the plaintiff had no right where he was when the accident occurred. 2nd. That the engine and trucks which caused the accident were not at that time under the management of the defendant’s company. 3rd. That there was such contributary negligence on the part of the plaintiff as to entirely disentitle him to come there and ask for damages. The Isle of Wight Railway Company, prior to the passing of the Act of Parliament authorising the construction of these improvement works in Brading Harbour, had a quay upon which they landed their goods. It ran into the sea a considerable distance, and it was upon this quay that the accident happened. Then the Brading Harbour Company obtained their Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a railway, as well as reclaiming the harbour. Under the provisions of their Act they thought it best to connect their works with those of the Isle of Wignt Railway, and this jetty was the part where the two works were connected. On the day this accident happened the works were not in a very advanced state, and it was not considered safe to run the engine over the short piece which connected the two. The trucks ran out of the jetty all right, but in bringing them back it was necessary, in order to drive these trucks up the incline to use great momentum by the means of the engine, which did not, however, go over the bridge. The engine, therefore which was employed to give this momentum, was not on defendant’s line, and did not belong to the company. The plaintiff had no right to go on the lines of the quay, and he ought to be able to prove that he went there for some lawful purpose. If he had a vessel coming up to the quay, that would have entitled him to have gone down to make the necessary arrangements, but in this case he was distinctly told the vessels had not arrived. With regard to his last point he should prove that the necessary signals, in addition to the warnings, were given to the plaintiff. Notwithstanding this, plaintiff went and placed himself behind the skipp, and the accident occurred. He called<br />
George Lock, labourer, working on the quay at Brading, who said he remembered the day the accident occurred. It was between 10 and 11, that the engine was just going to shove the trucks over. Plaintiff met him, and said, ” Is there any vessel in for us?” Witness replied, ‘No.” Then Jacobs said to Dawes, “Now we are here, let’s see the works at the end of the jetty.” That was all that was said, and the witness cleared the jetty of all the people, except Dawes and Jacobs. He saw nothing more of them till they were knocked into the water. Dawes said to plaintiff, before they were got out of the water, ” I knew we were in the wrong place.” They had no right there, and all the other men were cleared off the jetty. Witness stood on the opposite side when the wagons passed, and there was plenty of room for him.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Feltham. — There was plenty of room for me, and no wagon touched me. There were several men in the trucks. They had plenty of time to get away safely. We had no goods van. We don’t generall put coal on a goods van (laughter).</p>
<p>Mr. Feltham.— How many flaps were down ?</p>
<p>Witness. — Ah! you want to know more than I do. We have had several slight accidents. I cautioned plaintiff and Dawes myself, and told them they had better clear off the jetty. Jacobs then asked if there was a vessel in for him, and I said, ” No.” I am foreman of the jetty.</p>
<p>George Stickley, better known as ” Spider,” in the employ of Mr. Seymour, the contractor, said that on the day the accident happened he come from St. Helen’s to Brading Quay. He come there with an engine to shunt trucks. When they saw plaintiff they whistled three times, and witness went the length of that room towards him, and told him he must get out of the way or put up with the consequences.</p>
<p>Mr. Feltham cross-examined this witness, but failed to shake his testimony,</p>
<p>and His Honour said that if plaintiff was warned off and selected a dangerous spot in which to stand the company were not to blame for that.</p>
<p>Mr. Feltham contended that plaintiff was there on business.</p>
<p>His Honour.— But if he was told his barges were not there, he was there as an amateur.</p>
<p>Mr. Feltham.— We all know how these railway fellows will swear.</p>
<p>His Honour. — I am afraid other gentlemen will swear too. These men are the servants of two different parties entirely.</p>
<p>George Hemmings, the guard in charge of the trucks, corroborated as to the whistle being sounded three or four times, and said that he shouted to Jacobs to get out of the way. The next he saw of them was to see Jacobs’ hat flying over.</p>
<p>Mr. Fardell. — It is suggested he went over after his hat (laughter).</p>
<p>Witness.— He might if he had any respect for it (laughter). We were a quarter of an hour putting a plate right, so that plaintiff had plenty of time to get away. The trucks might have been going at the rate of 8 or 10 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Frederick Henshall, engine driver, said that on the 30th of July he was driving an engine belonging to the Brading Harbour Company. He brought some trucks to the Beckley corner, and was waiting for the order of the shunter, who was waiting for the signal of the platelayer. When witness got his signal he whistled three times, and then started the engine. He thought they must have heard the whistle ; it could be heard three miles.</p>
<p>George Wetherick, goods foreman at Brading Quay, also corroborated.</p>
<p>His Honour considered the accident caused entirely by plaintiff’s own act. If his business was to go to the quay to his barges he waa told that they were not there. After he was warned he did not attempt to get out of the way ; at least that was the evidence of the witnesses called, and he saw no reason to disbelieve them. On the ground therefore of contributory negligence he gave judgment for the defendants with costs.</p>

<p>AN ACCIDENT — happened at the Brading works on Monday. While a gang of men were at work on the gangway, William David Mursell, of Bembridge, let his foot slip. He fell into the tide and was drowned, and the inquest will be held this day (Wednesday). Another man named Jones also fell in, but was saved by a party in a boat and by Captain Seymour, who jumped overboard and rendered great assistance.

<p>An ordinary meeting of this Board was held on Monday afternoon, at the Surveyor’s Office, High Park, when there were present — Messrs. Stone (chairman), Brook, sen., J. O. Brook, Caws, Moody, Reed, Callaway, Matthews, and Tutte.</p>
<p>The St. Helen’s sewage.</p>
<p>The Clerk read a letter, which had been received from the Secretary of the new company which is now making a roadway and embankment across Brading Harbour. At the last meeting of the Board it was agreed to write a letter to the company, pointing out that the company, by constructing their works, were interfering with the sewage matter which came from the sewage farm at St. Helen’s, and claiming as good an outlet for it as they had before the works were constructed. The company, in reply, repudiated any liability.<br />
their works affected the Board.</p>
<p>The Chairman said that the company seemed to misapprehend the question. They had previously allowed their sewage to drain into what was virtually a tidal harbour, and the company would convert this into an inland lake or fresh-water stream, into which the Board could not carry the sewage. Perhaps what flowed from the sewage farm could not, strictly speaking, be called sewage ; still there could be no doubt it was highly impregnated with sewage matter. The company said they were prepared to allow them to connect the Board sewers with theirs, but this they could only do provided the outfall was unobjectionable, but they were not told where this was to go to. They might drain into the stream for land drainage, but not for sewage. They must know where their outfall was to be before they could go to the Local Government Board. They had a common law right to drain into the harbour ; that had been turned into fresh water, and as the company had altered it he contended they must put things right. The Board were there first.</p>
<p>It was understood that the Clerk should write another letter on the subject.</p>
</div>
<p>That wasn’t to be the only run in between The Brading Harbour Company  amd the sewer commissioners, as the following review of a court case in 1886 demonstrates.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">THE BRADING RECLAMATION WORKS. - Wednesday, April 7th, 1886</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000495/18860407/041/0004">Hampshire Advertiser</a>, 1886-04-07, p. 4</p>
<p>The case of Estcourt v. The Brading Harbour Company was heard before Mr. Justice Wills, on Friday, without a jury.</p>
<p>This was an action to restrain the defendants from maintaining a dam or other obstruction across the river Yar, near Brading, in the Isle of Wight, which the plaintiffs, the Commissioners of Sewers for the Isle of Wight, contended was wrongfully constructed, and was an obstruction to the river Yar, so as to obstruct its natural flow of water from the Sandown level. The defendants denied that the dam was wrongfully constructed, and pleaded that they were justified in erecting tbe said dam owing to the plaintiffs having so altered the flow of the river Yar as to be injurious to their works, and also that the court had no jurisdiction in the matter. The facts of the case are shortly as follows :— The Brading Harbour Company, which was incorporated under a special Act in 1874, had reclaimed a large tract of land at the mouth of the river Yar, which they said was liable to be flooded, owing to the plaintiffs having lowered a sluice in a sea wall which was erected to keep out the sea from certain lands at the mouth of the river. The defendants, to protect themselves against inundation, had erected a dam in the river below the sluice so as to interfere with the flow of the river. And the action was for an injunction to restrain them from so obstructing the river.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Webster, for the plaintiffs, contended that the defendants had no right to interfere with the natural flow of the river, and that, under section 10 of their private Act, the defendant company shall at all times maintain to the satisfaction of the Commissioners the free discharge of all waters draining into Brading Harbour, and under section 29 that company before commencing any works shall submit them and have them approved by the Commissioners of Sewers, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction in respect of the dam.</p>
<p>Mr. Graham, for the defendants, called attention to section 41 of the Companies’ Act, 1874, which provides that questions touching the companies’ works shall be referred to an engineer from the Board of Trade. The Commissioners of Sewers had no right to interfere with private property, and the sluice from time immemorial had been at the same level.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Wills.— Your difficulty is section 10. The stream is prima facie within the jurisdiction of the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Graham.— They have only jurisdiction if they acquire the land.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Wills referred to section 39. The following cases were cited for the defendants :— ” Duke of Newcastle v. Clark “(8 Tamp., p. 612), ” Cross- man v. Bristol and South Wales Railway Company” (1 Hemming and M., 531), and” Stacy v. Nelson” (12 M .and W., 535.</p>
<p>Mr. Chester followed on the same side.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Wills, in giving judgment, said :— At the time of the passing of the Act of 1874, the Commissioners of Sewers had a right to maintain a sluice that would induce to the better draining of the land. The Act of Parliament seems to take the view that the draining of the upper land should not be interfered with by works on the land below. (The learned Judge then referred to section 10 of the company’s private Act 1874.) I see nothing to prevent the Commissioners from exercising what was up to that time their prerogative, to alter works if that would discharge fresh water from their level, and to alter the works at the expense of the company. Section 39 says the Company before commencing any works shall submit such works and have them approved by the Commissioners of Sewers. This interferes with the rights of the company, and the real meaning is that no works interfering with rights of drainage shall be commenced without the Commissioners having the power to veto them. Section 41 says that certain works shall be referred to an engineer from the Board of Trade. This is not such a work. Section 39 refers to one class of works, section 41 refers to another. It is said that there is no jurisdiction to grant this injunction, and that the Commissioners cannot maintain an action for damages, and therefore cannot maintain an action for an injunction. It may be that they cannot maintain an action for damages. The court has power to grant an injunction, I therefore give judgment for the plaintiffs with costs.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">A HOLIDAY RAMBLE. - Saturday, April 27th, 1878</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18780427/032/0008">Isle of Wight Observer</a>, 1878-04-27, p. 8</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Isle cf Wight Observer.</p>
<p>Sir,— When any one who has been absent from a locality for some time returns he notes the slowly-made changes which have taken place during his absence with a keener eye yhan those living near the place, who hardly understand wht time has done. So it was with me. … From Priory Bay I made my way round by the shore to the St. Helen’s point. When I first visited the Island, some 20 years ago, the woods used to stretch luxuriantly at this point right down to the waters’ edge ; the force of the sea breakers was stayed by a tremendous reef of rocks. Mr. Smith, on obtaining the estate here, thought it would be a good speculation to use the rocks for building. Unfortunate design ! No sooner were they rooted up than the encroachments of the sea on the now unprotected shore caused a succession of landslips, till, in one or two cases, the fringe of woods on the shore seems to have been washed entirely away, and the shore is almost impassable at some places for the blue slipper, into which the foot sinks. At all events, I am told it cost the imprudent Mr. Smith as many thousands to protect his fast-decreasing property by a sea wall as he gained hundreds by the sale of nature’s protectors — the rocks. In my waltc, or rather scramble, on the shore, I noticed that this wall had again been washed down in many places, and some parts evidently during the past winter, for fine pine trees had partially fallen with the slip of the earth, and were drooping their tail tops over the shore, as if lamenting the change. Several were fallen down on the shore, and had been cut off. Altogether it seemed to me at this part of my ramble that the beauty of the shore just beyond Priory Bay had, to a certain extent, departed. A dilapidated wall looks so much worse than a wood gently sloping to the sea. This wall extends right round to the remains of old St. Helen’s church, which still stand as a landmark to passing vessels This, too, did not seem to look so nice as in bygone days. There used to be a pretty little wood behind it, full of flowers and wild strawberries. This seems to have partly gone too, and the wall and a fence made it inaccessible. A fence surrounded the old church ground, which was at one time open, and much used by the villagers for tea parties, &amp;c. I suppose this is done because the land was at one time consecrated and no doubt contains many remains of poor mortality. Some of the villagers could remnember when the headstones were there. A walk across the Duver soon brought me in sight of what I had greatly desired to see— Brading Harbour Improvements. The old Duver was just the same as ever ; but looking over the miilpond I could see that a number of houses had sprung up since my last visit. I passed by the Brading Harbour Oyster Fishery Company’s beds, and noticed they were not quite denuded of oysters, although a staring notice as to trespassers, and a reward of £5 for information leading to the apprehension of any one taking the oysters, caused me to ” sheer off “. I could not help thinking that the gallant Major who got so large a sum awarded him for the fishery was a very lucky individual. As I passed by the mills, for the first time I had a good view of the much-talked-of harbour improvements, and I must confess to some little disappointment. The work did not look nearly so forward as I had been led to understand, and I believe it will be a long time yet before all the sea is kept out of the harbour and fat kine graze upon the mud flats. Up to the present they have made a railway running down by the side of the harbour nearly as far as the mill, and have heaped up quite a quay nearly opposite. A bank of stones, sand, &amp;c., runs from Bembridge, on the opposite side, and bears some rails, but still there is the deepest anu most difficult part of th© channel to be overcome- before the two lines will meet and passengers conveyed to Bembridge, or the sea be dammed out from the mud flats. There seems to be a considerable amount of work to be done before this is arrived at. St. Helen’s Green seems to be gradually awaking to a sennse ot its merits, and the population is increasing at a great rate, to judge by the number of new houses which have sprung up. My walk home was rather a hurrid one in consequence of a wet eveing, but I found time to notice with regret that some one, with hideous taste, had substituted a stone wall for the green hedge that at one time used to encircle the parish church uf St. Helen’s, and that the pretty little tollhouse at St John’s had been pulled down, to be removed further on I suppose.</p>
<p>I remain, Sir, yours, &amp;c,<br />

<p>County Bench</p>
<p>SATURDAY — The county magistrates in attendance were Mr. F. White-Popham (chairman), Mr. J. Coape, Sir Barrington Simeon, Bart., Major-General the Hon. J. G. Somerset Calthorpe, and Sir Graham Hamond Graeme, Bart.</p>
<p>Alleged Attempt to Defraud.— Frederick Cooper, labourer, was charged with uttering a forged order called a sub-ticket, with intend to defraud. —David Pike, canteen keeper, of the Brading Harbour Company, deposed that prisoner was employed on Brading harbour works, and lived at St. Helen’s, where the canteen was kept. The labourers were paid only once a week, on Saturday. The contractor’s office was at Bembridge. Most of the labourers lived at St. Helen’s. It was the practice for the company to issue tickets to the men for small sums. A sum of money was placed in the hands of witness and he cashed the tickets, which were in his own handwriting. He handed them to the timekeeper, who issued them to the men who required them. On the 21st inst. prisoner came to the canteen with the ticket now produced, and witness handed him 2s for it. Noticed soon after prisoner had left that the ticket was not in due form.— Cecil Raymonf Seymour, timekeeper on the works, living at St. Helen’s, explained the issue of the tickets, being deducted from the men’s pay at the end of the week. On Wednesday last, when there was 5s due to the prisoner, the witness Pike brought him the ticket in question.He did not issue this ticket to prisoner. Issue of the tickets was a matter of convenience for paying money in advance to save him as timekeeper from carrying about a large amount in silver. The men could purchase anything at the canteen when they received the money for the tickets. Police-constable Goerge, onthe morning of the 22nd inst. apprehended prisoner on the works at St. Helen’s, when prisoner said he got a ticket from the timekeeper on the 21st, and the timekeeper, in prisoner’s presence, denied it. The Chairman, in dismissing the case, said the magistrates thought that, however convenient the system of tickets for payment of advances, it was a pity the tickets were payable only at the canteen in which the contractor for the work had an interest.</p>

<p>CHARGE OF UTTERING A FORGED ORDER- Frederick Cooper, navvy, St. Helen’s, was charged with uttering a forged order.— Daniel Pyke said he was canteen-keeper at the Brading Harbour Improvement Works, at which the prisoner was employed. At the work they made use of order tickets, each ticket being for 2s. The men were paid by on Saturday, but during the week any workman by going to the timekeeper could get a ticket or tickets, which they brought to him at the canteen, and he gave them money for it. On Wednesday last the prisoner brought him the ticket produced, for which he gave him 2s., but after he left he noticed it was a forged ticket, which he gave over to the time-keeper. By the Chairman : What do you sell at the canteen, and do the workmen make purchaeas there when they receive their money ?- Witnesss: They sell groceries at the canteen, and the men do not make purchases at the time they are paid, but afterwards return and make purchases.— The Chairman : Has the contractor an interest in the profits of the canteen?-Witness; Yes; the contractor has an interest in what is sold at the canteen.—Cecil Reynolds Seymour said he had been timekeeper at the Brading Harbour Works for about a month, and on every Monday he received 35l. worth of order tickets, and sent the same amount in cash to the last witness at the canteen. Each ticker was for 2s. On Monday last the prisoner came to the office and received an order and another on Tuesday, but he did not give him the order on Wednesday. The ticket produced, which he received from the last witness, was a forged order. After giving the prisoner 4s., there was still 5s. due to him.— The Chairman put the same questions to this witness as he did to the last as to the canteen.— The Chairman, in discharging the prisoner, strongly condemned the way in which the men were paid.</p>

The eastern peninsula is there called the <em>Isle of Bembridge</em>, the western the <em>Isle of Freshshwater</em> ; and twelve years later it was proposed to make the latter into a real island by cutting a trench to the sea at Freshwater Gate, and to fortify it as a refuge and citadel in case of an invasion.</p>
<p>p62</p>
<p>From Brading town to St. Helen’s stretched until recently the wide estruary of Brading Haven. Now, with the exception of enough to make a useful harbour at Bembridge, this great estuary, where Sir John Oglander’s father would shoot ” forty fowl of a night,” has been reclaimed by the directors of the ” Liberator ” Companies.</p>
<p>The nature of the appeal made by this wild scheme in the first instance to the daring speculators who, seventeen years ago, embarked the resources of the company in an enterprise of which not only the practical difficulty, but the financial worthlessness, had already been proved by actual experiment, as early as the reign of James I., will probably remain among the unknown factors of commercial failure. The belief in the possibility of getting “Something for nothing,” due to the notion that land won from the sea is a kind of treasure-trove, may have quieted the first misgivings of shareholders. But the fact that Sir Hugh Myddelton, the engineer of the New River, though a ” crafty fox and subtle citizen,” as Sir Oglander noted, had ultimately failed, not only to maintain his reclamationofBradingHaven,buttomakeit paywhilethedamlasted, was well known in the history of engineering ; and though the mechanical difficulties might be overcome by modern machinery, the nature of the harbour bottom for the growth or non-growth of crops and grasses could hardlyhavechanged. Briefly,the past history of the Brading reclamation was as follows. In 1620 Sir Hugh Myddelton dammed the mouth of the river Yar at Bembridge, opposite Spithead, and on the seven hundred acres of land so reclaimed he “tried all experiments in it ; he sowed wheat, barley, oats, cabbage-seed, and last of all rape-seed, which proved best ; but all the others came to nothing.” ” The nature of the ground, after it was inned,” wrote Sir John Oglander, ” was not answerable to what was expected, for almost the moiety of it next to the sea was a light, running sand, and of little worth. The inconvenience was in it, that the sea brought so much sand and ooze and seaweed that these choked up the passage for the water to go out, insomuch that I am of opinion that if the sea had not broke in there would have been no current left for the water to go out, so that in time it would have laid to the sea, or else the sea would have drowned the whole country. Therefore, in my opinion, it is not good meddling with a haven so near the main ocean.”</p>
<p>This experiment had cost in all £7,000, when the sea broke in ten years later, and Sir Hugh Myddelton’s fields once more became harbour-bottom, and cockles and winkles once more grew where his meagre crops of oats and rape had struggled for existence. Some years later an offer was made to repair the dam for £4,400, but this fell through. No one thought it worth while to spend the money, though small arms and creeks of the harbour were from time to time banked off and reclaimed by adjacent landowners. The attempt which had baffled Sir Hugh Myddelton was suddenly revived by the Liberator directors seventeen years ago. The sea was banked out, almost on the lines of Sir Hugh Myddelton’s dam, a straight channel of double the size necessary for the mere drainage of the higher levels was cut for the passage of the river and the holding of its waters during high-tide, when the sluices are automatically closed ; and a railway and quay were added, with a hotel at Bembridge. Solid and costly as their embankment was, the sea broke in, steam-engines and machinery were toppled from the dvkes and buried in the mud, workmen were drowned, and the whole enterprise was within an ace of becoming a little Panama. But at last the sea was beaten, 643 acres of weltering mud were left above water, and the reclamation, such as it is, is probably won for ever. But at what a cost ! Four hundred and twenty thousand pounds are debited to Barading reclamation, of which vast sum we may assume that £100,000 were expended on the railway quay and buildings, leaving £320,000 as the price of 643 acres of sea-bottom.</p>
<p>As reclamation of mud-flats and foreshores has lately been much advocated as a means of providing ” work and wages,” and of adding to the resources of the country, the present state and probable future of the land won from the sea at Brading is a matter of some interest, omitting all considerations of the original cost. We may concede at once that, from the picturesque point of view, the reclaimed harbour is a great improvement on the ancient mud-flats. It has added to the Isle of Wight what seems a piece of Holland, covered with green pasture and grazing cattle. This area is as much withdrawn from the intrusion of man as the old lagoon ; for as on the mud-flats there were no roads, no rights-of-way, and no footpaths, so the reclamation is a roadless district, secured absolutely to the use of the occupiers, and incidentally to the wild-fowl which swarm by its shallow pools and drains. The broad embanked river runs straight through the centre, and divides into two the level which lies like a green sea between the ring of surrounding hills and the harbour-bank. In this river, the waters of the ancient reclamations higher up the valley collect during high-water, when the pressure from the sea automatically shuts the sluices, and pour out during low-tide, when the pressure of the sea is removed, through the iron gates, near which lie, with the grooves still sound and sharply cut, parts of the sluices made for Sir Hugh Myddelton of English oak in the year 1621. The general shape of the reclamation is an oval, with one of the smaller ends facing the sea and the other abutting on ancient dams near Brading, two miles higher up the valley. The whole of this has been converted into firm, dry land ; neither is its quality so inferior as Sir Hugh Myddelton judged. Possibly the improvement in the seventeen years during which the old sea-bottom has been exposed to sun and rain, has been proportionately more rapid than in the ten in which it was exposed to the air after 1620. Then half the area was described as consisting of ” light, running sand of little worth,” though the upper portion promised to become valuable pasture. Those advocates of reclamation of land from the sea, who propose to ” leave it to Nature ” when the sea has once been barred out, can see at Brading and Bembridge what it is exactly that Nature does, and how far art can help to make old sea-bottom into pasture for cattle, and even into a playground for men and women, in seventeen years. It must be remembered that in this case Nature has been hurried, and made to do her work before her time. Left to itself, the harbour would have silted up in the course of centuries, and the pastures would have grown of themselves on land already covered with the alluvial mould. As it is, the sea was swept trom the land, which had to take its chance as it was—mud, sand, shingle, or cockle-beds, just as they came. There was not even an earthworm on the whole six hundred acres to move the soil and help the rain to wash the salt out of it. The wonder is not that the change has taken place so slowly, but that the change from a soil supporting marine vegetable growth to a soil largely covered with grass, clover, and trefoil, has matured so quickly. What was once the head of the bay is now good pasture covered with cattle and letting for 30s. an acre—there are one hundred and fifty acres of this good ground. Nature had already prepared it in part—for it was mud washed from the valley above—and still preserves in contour, though covered with grass, the creeks and ” fleets ” in which the tide rose and fell. All round the fringes of the flat, where it joins the old shore, the earthworms have descended and made a border of fair soil. On one side sewage has been run into the hungrier soil, and there, on a natural level, the true use and place of such experiments is seen. Three crops of grass a year are cut from ground which otherwise would not fetch more than 53. an acre a hint, perhaps, for the disposal of some of the London “effluent.” There remains a portion of dead, sour greensand on which no herbage grows, though the advance of soil and grass may be noted, like the gradual spread of lichen on a tree. Each patch of rushes, each weed and plantain, gathers a little soil round its roots or leaves, and the oasis spreads until all is joined and made one with the better ground. A cattle-farm and nursery garden occupy the centre of the seaward curve. The farm is already surrounded by rich grasses, clover, and sweet herbage, and the garden is a wonder of fertility. Not only vegetables, but roses, chrysanthemums, carnations, lavender, and other garden flowers are there reared in profusion ; and in the winter masses of mauve veronica are in blossom. In walking over what is now good pasture, the evidences of the recent nature of all this agricultural fertility crop up on every side. Where the turf lies in knolls and hillocks, the sea-shells may still be seen lying bleached or purple among the roots of the grass, and what would be taken for snail-shells elsewhere are found to be little clusters of the periwinkles and mussels for which Brading Haven was once famous. But perhaps the greatest success in the conversion of the old harbour to daily use is the present condition of the ” light, running sand” near the sea. This sand must have a stratum of clay beneath it, for groves of poplar trees planted on it are now in vigorous growth. But for some years the land lay barely covered with cup-moss, lichen, and thin, poor grass, a haunt of rabbits and shore-birds. It is now converted into a golf-ground, and studded at short intervals with level lawns of fine turf for ” putting greens,” which daily extend their area, and promise before long to convert the ” running sands ” into a beautiful and park- like recreation ground. The beauty of the whole scene is much increased by the number of half-wild swans, which are constantly in movement, either swimming upon the pools and streams, or flying to and from the sea. These swans are among the natural agents busied in aiding the reclamation of the land. They feed almost entirely upon the weeds which would otherwise choke up the dykes, and it is believed that two
swans do as much work in keeping the waterways free and open as could be done by a paid labourer.
The history and fortunes of a given area of land are the constant subject of story. The rise and fall of the importance of a particular part of the sea, except perhaps as constituting a fishery, has seldom been made the theme of a historian. Yet there are certain areas of sea off the English coasts which have an average population much greater than that of the adjacent land, and have maintained this pre-eminence for centuries. There are the great roadsteads off the English coasts, places in which ships and their crews congregate as naturally for food, shelter, or refit, as do the sea-fowl off certain parts of the coast. The proximity of a great harbour is not a necessary feature of such roadsteads. The fleets of vessels which in certain winds lie off the ” Downs ” in the Channel have little or no communication with the shore. But usually the roadstead lies off a harbour, and the permanence of the port makes the occupation of the adjacent sea a matter of course, so long as the harbour continues to be used. For some reason this has not been the case at Portsmouth and Spithead.</p>
<p>St. Helen’s Roads, off St. Helen’s Point, and opposite the mouth of the old Brading Haven, now Bembridge Harbour, was once the favourite anchoring ground of the British fleets when about to leave for foreign service ; and their communications with the island were almost as frequent and important as with Portsmouth itself. The fleets used to leave Spithead and anchor off St. Helen’s, sending to Bembridge, at the point where a spring of fresh water runs down from the sloping cliff to the sea, to fill their water casks, and to the little village of Bembridge itself for their fresh meat, so long as they remained, which was taken out daily to the ships in ” row-barges.” Hence the old inn was originally called the ” Row-Barge ” and the country people, farmers, and village tradesfolk profited greatly by the presence of the fleet. For a time the Isle of Wight held the place for which it seemed naturally suited in those days, of a victualling-ground for the minor needs of the fleet. Sir John Oglander, long before this, had foreseen this possibility, though he did not expect the development which brought the ships to the mouth of the harbour which lay almost in touch with his own park at Nunwell. He proposed that a new port and road should be made at Cowes for a “rendezvous.” “If the country would have so much discretion as to make good use of that harbour, as first to have an honest man to be captain there, to build storehouses, to have by a joint store of all provision, and to have that their rendezvous, and to victuall there, they need no other market nor means to make the island happy and fortunate.”
The first account of a British fleet lying for a long period off St. Helen’s is preserved in the Fleming Collection at Rydal Hall, and gives the list of ships and ” order of array ” for an expected battle with the French in 1545. Henry VIII. , only two years before his death, drifted into war with both France and Scotland on the burning question of the betrothal of the baby princess, Mary Oueen of Scots, to Edward the Prince of Wales. Henry was at that time in the position of a tenant for life of a large estate, who has exhausted the savings of his ancestors and his own credit. He had only two more vears to live, but the national, or rather the royal, exchequer was drained. All his father’s savings were spent. The whole of the Church property had already been sold in the greatest possible hurry at the lowest possible price. The last financial expedient of debasing the coinage till the proportion of base metal was as four to six, had brought nothing in, and destroyed credit; and Henry, in his old age, found himself threatened with a French invasion, and without means to equip a sufficient fleet.</p>

The idea of reclaiming the extensive mudflats, which for years hare only been haunted by the ” winkle picker,” originated with Mr. E J. H.

<p>The Reclamation of  Haven.— After many ominous shakes of the head from people residing in the locality of St. Helen’s, there can be no doubt that Mr. Seymour has successfully completed the task of keeping back the water from the extensive mud flats which for years have furnished such capital spots for the ” winkler ” aud the fowler. The idea of reclaiming the extensive tract of submerged laud called  Haven, originated with Mr. R J. H. Saunders, C.E., who succeeded in forming a company to provide the requisite capital. No trifling amount was required, for already the amount expended has reached the formidable sum of £80, 000. For this investment the company have some 700 acres of land, and although at present this does not look very promising, there can be little doubt that, in a few years time, there will be a good return from it. At the top of the harbour are what are known as the marshes, a tract of low land which has evidently been at some period reclaimed from the sea by an embankment, and this is stated to be one of tho best pieces of grazing land in the Wight. The farmers say that it fattens beasts extremely well, and some consider this is owing to the salt which still remains in the land. There is every hope, therefore, that in a few years’ time the land now reclaimed will be equally good. But the reclamation of the harbour was by no means the whole of the company’s scheme. They are now constructing a railway to St. Helen’s and Bembridge, and a large portion of the embarking work will also serve to carry the railway. Bembridge is at present a locality very little visited, owing to the difficulty and trouble of reaching it. Horses and carriages have had to go a long way round to get to it. and the pedestrian from Ryde could only shorten the route by crossing a ferry at St. Helen’s. Nevertheless, Bembridge is one of the prettiest little places in the Island, and very healthy. Already a number of gentry have settled there, and when it is connected with the other parts of the Island by rail, it will probably soon arrive at the dignity of a town, and the company, who have shown so much enterprise, will reap a rich reward.</p>

<p>Could old Sir Hugh Middleton re-visit this earth and again cast his eyes over the watery expanse that lays beyond “ye ancient borough of Bradinge,” he would find the desire of his heart accomplished. For two years the navvy has been toiling away St. Helens and Bembridge ; and strong and able workmen under the able direction of Mr. Frederick Seymour have devoted their minds and bodies to one object—to reclaim Brading Haven from the sea. On Thursday last that work was accomplished and over eight hundred acres of what will in the course of a few years be probably fine pasture land were reclaimed from the sea. This land will be the property of the Brading Haven Reclamation Company ; and imagine that its value will more than equal the cost the reclamation. We cordially congratulate Mr Frederick Seymour in having brought so arduous an undertaking to successful termination. The name this gentleman will be handed down to posterity as the one who carried out the mightiest engineering work ever done in this island. Not merely has this gentleman reclaimed 80 acres of land, but the inhabitants of Bembridge and St. Helens have been greatly benefitted by his enterprise in other matters; and we hope that he will meet with substantial recompense for the great work he has accomplished. The Isle Wight is larger by over 800 acres than it was when we went to press last week.— <em>Ryde Newspaper.</em> [Mr. F. Seymour has many friends in Jersey].</p>

The match was less remarkable as a display of skill, than from the fact that it was played upou ground till recently covered by the sea, and hardly yet firm enough to enable a good match to be played. The Brading team won easily, but a considerable number of persons assembled, more curious it appeared as to the firmness of the ground than the ability of the cricketers.</p>

<p>Bembridge and its Prospects. —Our correspondent writes as follows :— I paid a visit to this little village on Tuesday on the occasion of the annual regatta, and was surprised at the change which a few years had made in the locality. Situated at the extreme eastern end of the Island, and cut off from communication with Ryde by the harbour, it has hitherto been so difficult of access as to be quite out of the way of the general tourist and traveller . All this is being altered, and in a few months Bembridge will be as accessible as any other watering place in the Island. Desirous of examining the effects of the new reclamation works which keep back the water from what used to be ” Brading Harbour,” I walked from Brading to Bembridge along the old shore. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen’s side, just above the Mill, and terminating on the Bembridge aide near the Point. The sea is effectually kept out, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, the “harbour” now appears to be a brown and barren waste. As the mud banks have dried they I have cracked, and are covered with large fissures. Thousands of oookles, winkles, and sea weeds have come to a dry death in consequenoe of the reclamation, and their dried shells, which smell rather offensively, can be found by hundreds by scraping the surface of the banks. It will not be many years, however, before smiling green fields will make the inhabitants forget that this extensive tract was once covered with water. Here and there a blade of grass, hardier than its fellows, can already be seen sprouting. The new railway runs from the Brading Station by the side of what was the Harbour to St. Helen’s Mill, and will cross to Bembridge on the embankment. I noticed that there was still a good deal of water behind the embankment. This is fresh water, brought down by the River Yar, and flows through large flood gates up to the sea. On entering the village I saw a great change even within the last two years. A speculative gentleman, who had great faith in the place, many years ago built a large hotel and a number ot houses, but, no doubt owing to the difficulty of getting to the place, these remained empty for a number of years. I noticed, however, that all the houses were now let, and that a number of visitors were walking about. With a railway brought close to it, I have not the slightest doubt that before many years are past Bembridge will rival Sandown and Shanklin. The arboreal beauties of the place are most striking. Avenues of trees shelter the roads, and the pathway to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of Shanklin Chine. The beach is as good as that of Sandown, and protected by a reef of rocks. Altogether there seems some justification for the inhabitants waking up to a sense of the long-neglected beauties of the locality, and indulging in the confident hope that their prosperous days are at hand.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">BEMBRIDGE AND ITS REGATTA. - Saturday, August 30th, 1879</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790830/017/0006">Isle of Wight Observer</a>, 1879-08-30, p. 6</p>
<p>Although the guide books acknowledge the picturesque beauties of the “little village of Bembridge,” they also complain of the difficulty of access to it. There have been hitherto no better means of reaching it from Ryde than taking a carriage or walking along the road to St. Helen’s, and then crossing the mouth of the harbour at the ferry. This is so very awkward a route, and so extremely hilly, that Bembridge has remained till within the last year or so one of the most out-of-the-way places in the Island. On paying the place a visit on Tuesday, however, we were astonished at the change which about two years had made in the appearance of the locality. This change was almost entirely due to the new reclamation and railway works, which are still incomplete. Arriving at Brading by train, we took the opportunity of getting from thence to Bembridge by skirting along the shores of what used to be Brading Harbour. The reclamation works consist of a huge embankment, which stretches across the harbour in a slanting direction, commencing on the St. Helen’s side just above the water mill, and terminating on the Bembridge side near the Point. This effectually keeps out the sea, and, instead of looking like a beautiful lake, Brading “Harbour” has now the appearance of a desert. The mud-flats are all dried — at least as far as the surface is concerned, — but, remembering certain awful warnings of people who had sunk into treacherous mud up to their knees, we did not venture far. The banks as they have dried have cracked, and are covered with extensive fissures that do not add to their beauty. It has been a sad time for the winkles, cockles, and sea plants. In some sandy places, on scraping the surface, scores of cockles which had been dried up in their shells were found, while there were numerous winkles and sea weed which had met a like sad fate. Through the centre of the reclaimed banks flows a rather large stream called the Yar. It is a curious fact that there are two streams in the Island which go by this name, and this causes some confusion in the minds of the tourists. The stream has been the principal difficulty in carrying out the work, and an exit had to be provided for it by means of flood gates. In a few years time the appearance of the reclaimed land will be as pleasing as it is now the reverse. Nature soon throws her green mantle over the most desolate-looking spots, if there is plenty of water, and doubtless in a few years the inhabitants, viewing the green meadows here, will almost forget that they were once covered by the sea. Even now in some places a blade or two of grass may be seen shooting up. There is little doubt that centuries ago this harbour consisted of smiling fields, upon which the sea burst, either suddenly or by degrees, till 700 acres were covered. In the interesting account of the unsuccessful reclamation by Sir Hugh Middleton, it is stated that in the centre of the harbour a well was found, proving the truth of our statement. The new railway runs by the side of the harbour as far as the mill, and will then cross the embankment to Bembridge, where a station is in course of erection. On entering the village we were struck with the alteration in the appearance of the place, which seemed waking up to a sense of its own importance. The shops had been enlarged and the once desolate looking hotel was occupied. Bembridge happened to have been visited some 30 years ago by one of those unfortunate individuals who ” live before their time.” Charmed with the beauty of the place, he thought that nothing more was necessary to attract visitors here than to provide accommodation for them. He built a large hotel, and speculated in building, but empty house property soon showed him that something more than natural beauty was required to induce people to reside here. We noticed, however, that all the houses now appeared full, and unmistakable visitors were walking about. A stroll through the place convinced us that it would not be many years before Bembridge would rival Shanklin and Sandown. It has a beach hardly inferior to the latter, and the approach to the shore is so beautifully wooded as to remind one of the celebrated chine of the former. Its arboreal beauty is the chief cha- racteristic of tne village, which nas some of the most lovely avenues we have ever seen. No doubt we saw the village at its best on Tuesday, that being the second day of the regatta.</p>

<p>—Between the Bembridge and St. Helen’s Cliffs, at the Isle Wight, the sea entered and formed a lake known Brading Harbour, covering area of about 900 acres. A company has been formed for the purpose of constructing a railway from the Isle of Wight Railway Company’s main line to St Helen’s and across the mouth of the harbour to Bembridge. The work is being carried out by Mr Seymour, contractor, and after a number attempts the tide has been completely shut out of the harbour by a thick embankment taken across from St. Helen’s to Bembridge, and the land reclaimed is bo used for farming, and building purposes.</p>

<p>The Reclamation or the Harbour.</p>
<p>The company who have been carrying out the new reclamation works at the mouth of Brading Harbour have met with a most serious reverse. The high tides a few days ago made a breach in the embankment, which has been gradually getting larger and larger, and now the sea has resumd its sway over the whole extent of mud flats which had been dry for some months, and vessels actually go up to the quay at Brading again for chalk. The railway which runs by the side of the harbour is also covered at high tide, and on taking a walk over it on Sunday we noticed that the rails were covered with seaweed, and that sand and shingle were banking up round it in some places. The extent of embankment washed away, in spite of every exertion, is said to be over 70 feet. The work of restoration was put in hand immediately after the breach, and the work is being prosecuted most vigorously, but we understand the embankment will take a different course, so as to avoid the heavy sea wbich runs, in here occasionally.</p>

<p>The Reclamation Works.—</p>
<p>We last Monday paid a visit to the reclamation works at Brading Harbour, and found that the damage which had been done there was quite as great as had been reported. There was one part of the embankment, near the Bembridge side, which had to bear the brunt of the heavy sea which rolls in here. The embankment was sound enough, but nothing had been placed on its sides to keep the sand down in its place. The result was that the extraordinary high tide of a fortnight since washed over it, wetted the sand, which flowed away from the embankment like so much water. In a very short time a breach was made, and the sea had such a hold that it was impossible to stop it. The breach has since reached some 70 yards in width, and the sea has covered the whole of the harbour just the same as it did before the embankment was made. Vessels now come up and down the harbour to Brading Quay for chalk as if nothing had ever happened to check them. On walking down the side of the harbour we noticed that in several places the sea had covered the railway, and that the seaweed had washed over the rails, while the sand and shingle had silted up round them. It is, of course, of the utmost importance that the work should be put right, and a number of men are now at work re-making the embankment, which, we believe, will cross the harbour at a different point than it did before. Mr. Seymour has entered into a fresh contract to complete the work, and it is rumoured that his estimate of the cost of the new work required is £10,000. Mr. R. J. H. Saunders, the engineer of the company, writing to a contemporary, thus explains the cause of the accident : ” You will, no doubt, have heard that the extraordinary tide of last Friday night passed over the unfinished work at Bembridge, and within a very few hours a breach was made in the embankment so that the sea now flows again over the land reclaimed in June last. This is, of course, very disappointing, as the work was nearly completed along the whole length, and was everywhere considerably higher than the previous extraordinary tide. There was, therefore, no apprehension or thought of danger, and consequently no precautions were taken. This will, however, be a warning in the future to make assurance doubly sure, and to leave no point undefended. You will be pleased to learn that the work of restoration has already been put in hand. The directors were over the works yesterday with Mr. Grantham, the consulting engineer of the company, when, after very careful consideration of the whole question, it was unhesitatingly decided to prosecute the work vigorously, and an agreement was entered into for carrying it out at once with Mr. F. Seymour, the contractor, and I have every reason to believe I shall within two or three months have the satisfaction of informing you that the sea has been effectually shut out.”</p>

<p class="admonition-title">SHANKLIN RIOTS. - Saturday, April 10th, 1880</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18800410/013/0006">Isle of Wight Observer</a>, 1880-04-10, p. 6</p>
<p>The Electors of Shanklin are requested to read the undermentioned facts: 1. That on the 17th day of March, a meeting of Mr. Cotton’s constituents was held in the Assembly Rooms, in Shanklin, and a large number of Mr. Ashley’s supporters attended the meeting and prevented Mr. Cotton and other speakers from being heard, by hooting, yelling, and creating a disturbance throughout the whole of the proceedings ; and it was evident that it was the predetermined intention of Mr. Ashley’s supporters to prevent Mr. Cotton having a hearing, and not to treat him with the respect which candidates have a right to expect from their audience on such occasions. 2. That a few nights after the meeting the glass in the house and conservatory of Mr. Coster, a gentleman of Conservative principles, were smashed, that gentleman being absent from the Island at the time. 3. A meeting of Mr. Ashley’s supporters was held on the 2nd of April, and at which meeting the supporters of Mr. Cotton from Ventnor, Sandown, St. Helen’s, and other places were present, the men from St. Helen’s being chiefly of the labouring classes ; they arrived at Shanklin two hours previous to the meeting, in the open day ; this fact was well known to Mr. Ashley’s committee, and no communication as to the presence of these men or their attendance at the meeting was made to Mr. Cotton’s committee. The men behaved themselves respectably and orderly prior to their going to the meeting, and when in the hall had no weapons, nor appeared to be prepared for a disturbance, but, on the contrary, the sup- porters of Mr. Ashley appeared in the hall armed with bludgeons, short lengths of gas pipe, and other dangerous weapons, and evidently intent upon creating a serious riot. 4. That about 7.30, as Mr. Dampier-Child approached the Institute, he met a crowd of disorderly people, and was struck on the head by a missile. He went to Capt. Harvey’s house to warn him that a disturbance was likely to take place. Capt. Harvey, not supposing a disturbance was likely to occur, persuaded Mr. Dampier-Child to accompany him and another gentleman to Mr. Cotton s committee rooms. Just prior to arriving there they were surrounded and attacked by a mob of over 1 00 persons, residents of Shanklin, who threatened to take their lives. Mr. Dampier-Child and the other gentleman were knocked down and kicked senseless whilst ou the ground, and Capt. Harvey escaped from the crowd after being severely handled and receiving some heavy blows. It must be distinctly understood this riot took place before the time fixed for Mr. Ashley’s meeting, and that this mob of Mr. Ashley’s supporters had some time previously assembled, armed as before mentioned, with the intention ot creating a most serious riot. 5. That, in consequence of this not, many supporters of Mr. Ashley advised Col. Atherley, the Chairman, not to hold a meeting that night, for if he did serious consequences would ensue ; but eventually, about 8.30, the doors were opened, and it is certain that by this time the men from St. Helen’s had heard of the riot out of doors, and that one of the gentlemen who had been seriously injured in the riot was oue who was much respected amongst them. 6. That as soon as Col. Atherley appeared interruptions took place, by singing. A gentleman, also much respected by the St. Helen’s men, got up in a chair and informed Col. Atherley that if he would withdraw he thought he could obtain a quiet bearing for Mr. Ashley, the gentleman’s chair was immediately whipped from under him, and he was thrown on the floor by some of Mr. Ashley’s supporters. He got up again to carry his intention, the chair was again whipped from under him; and this time a most dangerous wound was inflicted on his head by some supporter of Mr. Ashley striking him from behind. Hereupon a riot ensued, but how long it continued the committee are not aware. The St. Helen’s men were met by several persons leaving Shanklin, about 9 o’clock, in an orderly manner, not offending any one, and, so far as Mr. Cotton’s committee can learn, no damage was done to the person or property of any one in Shanklin by Mr. Cotton’s supporters; whilst on the other hand, four gentle- men were assaulted aud three of them seriously injured by cowardly attacks from Mr. Ashley’s mob, who continued to do injury to property by breaking windows, &amp;c., until after midnight. The Committee offer these facts to the inhabitants of Shanklin and of the Isle of Wight generally, without any comment. H. HARRIS, Chairman, Mr. Cotton’s Committee, Shanklin</p>
<p>ANSWER TO THE CHARGE OF TORY RUFFIANISM IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT.</p>
<p>A True Account oj the late Riot at Shanklin from ihe commencement. It will be remembered that a short time since, Mr. B. T. Cotton held a meeting at Shanklin, and attempted to deliver an address to the electors, but the disturbance in the Hall was so great that he was unable to obtain a hearing, one of the ringleaders of the disturbance being the servant of Col. Atherley. On Friday last, a meeting was announced by the Hon. Evelyn Ashley, to be given at Shanklin, when doubtless bearing in mind the recep- tion given to Mr. Cotton, by the Liberals, some of tne Conservatives, aa private individuals, and not by the instructions of any person, determined to give the would- be Liberal member and the gallant Colonel a similar re- ception to Mr. Cotton’s. Thus far the cause of the Tories assembling is shewn, but the pamphlet which has been extensively circulated purporting to have been written by ” One who was there,” relates nothing of the rioting which took place before the meeting commenced. The electors shall bo shown how the gentle Shanklin Liberals treated gentle- men as they were quietly walking through th 3 streets. Mr. Latimer Saunders, Captain Harvey, and Mr. Dampier Child were walking through the High-street of Shanklin, about an hour before the Liberal meeting commenced, when they were set upon by a party of Liberal roughs and knocked down. Mr. L. Saunders had two teeth knocked out ; Mr. Dampier Child a rib broken, and all three gentlemen were severely bruised all over their bodies. I shall say nothing about the damage committed on Capt. Harvey’s house and property, or the serious assault perpetrated on him, as I saw nothing of the matter, but will give you aa account of the meeting. On the doors of the Hall being opened, the front seats were taken by about twenty respectable youag men belonging to Ryde ; these were followed by a number of Shanklin men, all of them having sticks in their hands, with the exception of one, he evideatly;ieader of the Shanklin party, and well known to the Ryde men, haying formerly been employed in Ryde, was armed with a piece of Iron, it having the appearance of having been cut off a gas pipe. After these had been in the Hall a little while, a tremendous cheering was heard outside, and the so-called ” gang of hired ruffians ” made their appearance. Of course a scene of considerable confusion ensued for some time, the Liberals cheering Ashley, and the Conservative giving cheers for Cotton, interspersed with cries of ” Wno sacked the Bobby!’’” After this had continued for some time a message was seat from the platform to Mr. R. Seymour, asking him if he could quiet his men, the reply was sent back that if the Chair- man would allow him to speak from the platform where he could be seen and heard, he would do his best to quiet the men. This very reasonable request was refused. Mr. Seymour then attempted to gain the men’s attention by standing on a chair, when before he could address them the chair was pulled from under him, when of course he fell on the floor. (About this time Mr. Ashley and the Chairman left the Hall.) Mr. Seymour no way daunted by his futile effort to gain a hearing, stood upon another chair and again tried to quiet the men, and again the chair was pulled from under him, this time causing him to fall on his head. This was the signal for the rioting inside the Hall to commence, the person who pulled the chair away being levelled by a chair striking him on the head. A tall dark gentleman then sprang from the platform and commenced striking among the navvies right and left. Of course this was not borne with very long, one of them behind rushing to the front and seizing the striker, forced the stick from him and paid him back in his own coin. A general fight now ensued, the navvies being without any weapons but those with which nature had provided tham, breaking un the chairs in the Hall and thereby obtaining some. I think this will do away with the assertion of ‘” One who was there,” that the navvies were armed with bars of iron and bludgeons, for if they had had these weapons there would have been no need for them to have taken the trouble to break up the chairs to arm themselves with. I left the Hall upon seeing the fight that was going on, and joined a crowd of about five hund-ed people who were assembled outside. I had been there about five minutes when the leader of the Shanklin roughs with his bar of iron in his hand appeared on the steps, wildly waving his arms, and shouting “All Shanklin men inside.” As no one responded to this call I suppose all the Shanklin men were inside, or else that there were no men in Shanklin. Of course when the navvies came out of the Hall they presented a somewhat different appearance to what they did when they entered it each one being armed with the leg or some portion oi a chair, so I suppose they had left their bars of iron and bludgeons behind them. No doubt they may have had some drink before entering, and also upon leavin- the Hall, but it was in the same way as the writer of this had it, and that was by paying for it from their own pockets; they were perfectly sober. The last I saw of the navvies they were marching on the Sandown-road with a crowd keeping at a respectable distance, pelting them with stones. Of course the heads of the Liberal party will try to make capital out of this affair, but there is not the slightest doubt that if Mr. Seymour had not been assaulted there would have been no riot.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">RECLAIMING LAND FROM THE SEA. - Saturday, April 17th, 1880</p>

<p>Our Engraving represents a view of the entrance to Brading Haven, Isle of Wight, at low water, and a portion the new embankment recently constructed to reclaim the Haven from the sea. It was until recently a large tract marshy ground, with a bold inlet of the sea, at high water, covering all the low lands between Bembridge and St. Helen’s, about eight to nine hundred acres being overflowed by the sea every tide. Originally this marshy ground was greater extent; but a portion was reclaimed in the reign Edward I. by Sir William Bessel, then warden the island. In 1594 German Richards, Esq., made an acquisition mill, marsh, and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge. In the reign of James I. an attempt on a grand scale was made by Sir Hugh Myddleton to inclose, and recover the haven from the sea; but after an expenditure of £7000 it was discovered that much of the recovered land was a light, running sand; and, finally, after various experiments, the project came to disastrous issue. In April, 1877, the “Brading Haven Reclamation Company accepted a tender of Mr. Frederick Seymour, of Bembridge (who had previously constructed the railway from Brading to St. Helen’s), for the construction of an embankment to reclaim the land contained in the Haven; which arduous work was successfully completed on Feb. 22 last, thus adding 800 acres of valuable land to the Isle of Wight. It is intended to continue the railway on the new embankment (which is one mile in length) from St. Helen’s to Bembridge. As, doubtless, many of our readers know, Bembridge is a village of great beauty, clothed in leaf and shade, nestling at the foot of Bembridge Down. It is an extremely picturesque spot, but, having previously been out of the ordinary track, has attracted but little notice. It is, however, well worthy of a visit, and its many retired nooks afford capital accommodation for picnics. Its sands, too, are firm and smooth, and offer good opportunities for sea-bathing. The view from the summit of Bembridge Down is the finest in the island. To the north the eye looks over the gently swelling grounds of St. Helen’s and sea view to Ryde; and, when glancing over the Solent, with fits majestic ships, commands the harbour of Portsmouth, Hayling Island, and the line of the Hampshire and Sussex coasts, where the slender spire of Chichester Cathedral may be seen pointing heavenwards —while the coast terminates in the blue haze which marks the position of Beaohy Head. To the south is beheld Sandown Bay, with its loamy cliffs alternately rising and sinking, until they tower in the gigantic mass of Dunmore and Shank!in Down. To the west the eye commands a wide view of the inland hills and valleys ; immediately below, the Yar winds its sinuous way through the green pastures of Brading Haven. Now that the land has been reclaimed and the facilities for reaching Bembridge are improved, in all probability this will become one of the favourite watering places in the Isle of Wight.</p>

There was a meeting on Monday, the 9th, at which complainant attended, and defendant’s books were gone through by Mr. R. Seymour, the time keeper. It was then found that defendant had not accounted for several sums which had been paid to him by the cashier for the past nine months. On Friday, the 11th, the complainant, in company with another, went to defendant and demanded an account of the the sums which had been paid in by the cashier, a list of which was handed to defendant. Defendant became very abusive and assaulted him in a very violent manner.— Complainant stated that when he went to defendant under the circumstances detailed, defendant struck him with his fist on the temple and almost rendered him insensible. — The other evidence given was rather contradictory, a witness called by defendant asserting that very high words passed between the two parties in the course of which complainant put his fist in defendant’s face.</p>

<p>Discovery of a Roman Villa near Brading.</p>
<p>An addition has been recently made to the historical attractions of the Isle of Wight by the discovery of Roman Villa at Moreton Farm, near Brading. The remains disclosed have already excited considerable interest among archaeologists, and it has been suggested by some of the Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London that further excavations be undertaken in order to ascertain the extent of the building or buildings, only a portion of which has been yet discovered. The first discovery of the villa is due to Captain Thorpe, of Yarbridge, near Brading, whose acquaintance with the neighbourhood led him to investigations which have proved to be of considerable interest in their connexion with the early history and occupation of the island. Some accounts of these preliminary explorations bave been published. The external walls, at present cleared, measure about 52ft. by 37ft., and enclose about six or seven chambers, with passages, connected, there is reason to believe, with others. In addition to tessellated floors, remains of hypocausts, flues, fresco paintings, roofing tiles, coins, pottery, and other interesting relics, there are the remains of a mosaic pavement, with design upon it of unusual character, and one which is worthy of careful study and attention. The design, though grotesque, is doubtless symbolical, and may be connected either with the mythology of the ancients or the early introduction of Christianity. Its interpretation is not here attempted. Other decorated floors are known to exist the vicinity, and these, when properly examined, may assist in the explanation. The remains evidently cover a large area, much of which under cultivation, but every facility for investigation has been accorded by Lady Oglander, the owner of the land, and Mr. Cooper, the present occupier. Excavations have been accordingly renewed, and are at present under the direction of Mr. John E. Price, F.S.A., and Mr. F. G. Hilton Price, F.G.S. Work was commenced last week, and already a new chamber has been opened up, enclosing an interesting mosaic, the central design of which is a representation of Orpheus playing on the lyre, and surrounded by animals, as usual. The border is an unusually good example of what known as the guilloche pattern. Pottery, glass, and coins have been also found ; among the latter several third brass of the reign of Victorious, a.d. 268. These investigations are important in their relation to the occupation of the island by the Romans. It has been said that the dark hair and brilliant eyes of the veritable natives are due to the Italian colonists. Its annexation to the Imperial power, due to Vespasian, in the first century, and its association in the third century with the fortunes of Carausius and Allectus, are indications of prolonged connection with tho Empire, yet the historians of old are silent as to the rinding of remains. Some, indeed, speak of them unknown. Of late years, however, the contrary ins been amply proved, and it is import tant that all Mich discoveries as the present should be carefully studied and described Inscriptions or other data may yet bo found which may shed considerable light what is already known the history the Isle of Wight during the Roman colonisation.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">The Haven.— In 1781, Sir Richard Worsley, in his famous History of the Island, considered it, worthy - Saturday, December 24th, 1881</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18811224/014/0006">Isle of Wight Observer</a>, 1881-12-24, p. 6</p>
<p>to chronicle the Haven ” us a large tract of marshy ground, containing 856 acres, covered every tide by the sea.” The recovery of so large a piece of land from the sea had been long an object in contemplation, aud Sir John Oglander had preserved accounts of several undertakings for this purpose. A part of Brading Haven was taken in by Sir William Russell, Lord of Yaverland (Warder of the Isle of Wight, in the reign of Edward I.), at the time when Yarbridge was erected. In the year 1562, another parcel of land was walled in from the sea by Mr George Oglander aud Mr German Richards, when the North-marsh and some adjoining lands qere gained, and in 1594 a third acquisition was made of Mill-marsh and other meadows between the sluice and the bridge by Mr Edward Richards. The next attempt was of a more extensive nature ; a grant ot the Haven was obtained from King James the 1st, by Gibbs, a groom of the bed chamber. The owners of the adjoining lands contested this grant, which the King was very earnest in supporting. After a verdict obtained in the exchequer against the gentlemen of the Island, Gibbs sold his share for £2000 to Sir Bevis Thelwwall, a page of the King’s bed chamber, who admitted the famous sir Hugh Miiddletou to a share from the sea. The first taking of it in cost £4000, and £1000 more were expended in building a dwelling house, barn, a watermill, trenching, quick setting, and other necessary works, so that, including the original purchase, the total expenditure amounted to £7000. But after all, the nature of the ground did not answer the expectations of the undertakers, for though that part of it adjoining Brading proved tolerably good, nearly one half of it was found to be a light running sand. Nevertheless as incontestible evidence appeared, by the discovery of a well cased with stone near the middle of the Haven, that it had formerly been good ground Sir Hugh Middleton tried a variety of experiments on the land which had been taken in before he sold his share, sowing it with wheat, barley, oats, cabbage, and finally with rape seed, which last was most successful. But the greatest discouragement was that the sea brought up so much ooze, weeds and sand, which choked up the passage for the discharge of the fresh water. At length, in a wet season, When the inner part of the Haven was full of water, and a high spring tide, the water met under the bank and made a breach. Thus ended this expensive project, and though Sir John Oglander, who lived in the neighbourhood confessed himself a friend to the undertaking, he declared it as his opinion that the scheme could never be resumed to any profitable purpose, and the following estimate in 1699 of the expenses necessary to recover it shews that the enclosing was again in contemplation :</p>
<p>May 10th, 1699.— The abstract of an estimate of the charge of taking in, draining, and securing of the Haven of Brading, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The damme, or sea wall, will be best to stand near about where the old wall stood, with some difference in the range and variation of the line thereof.</p>

The charge of closing and secutely shutting in of ihe old channel, which will be most difficult and troublesome work of the whole undertaking, will come to the sum of 1000 0 0<br />
The profit or recompense to the undertaker, whoever he may be, who shall be found able and successfully to design and execute the work, cannot in justice be less than the sum of 1000 0 0<br />
The total is £4170 0 0<br />
Hy. Sher, Surveyor.</p>
<p>We reprint the historian’s record of 1781, and refer to the successful reclamation of the Haven in 1881, believing such will be interesting to our readers. We regret we cannot, as we should like to do, record the actual cost, and therefore beg our readers not to conclude the wonderful estimate of Hy. Sher, surveyor, of May 16th, 1699, has covered all. Doubtless the Englishmen had, or will have, before the accounts are totalled, a few extras, which the Dutchmen could not get a certificate for. We however, hope the Brading Harbour Reclamation Company have followed the wise advice of the old surveyor and made some difference in the range and valuation of the line of the wall, from the unfortunate lines of Sir Hugh Middleton and his partner. and that they have mingled with the clay used in their wall some other proper material, and may it prove the estimated profit or recompense of the old surveyor will be far exceeded.— Communicated.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">OPENING OF THE ROYAL SPITHEAD HOTEL AND BRADING HARBOUR RAILWAY. - Saturday, July 22nd, 1882</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000069/18820722/031/0007">Hampshire Telegraph</a>, 1882-07-22, p. 7</p>
<p>Any stranger passing through Bembridge on Saturday last could not fail to notice an unwonted air of excitement about this, at one time isolated little village. Flags were flying, a band was playing, and the trains, as they passed up and down the little loop line which runs to Brading, were gaily decorated with evergreens, flowers, flags, &amp;c. The cause of all this was the formal opening of the “Royal Spithead” Hotel, which may be said to be the consummation of a work begun six years ago, commencing with the reclamation of the harbour to the extent of over 700 acres, and the consetruction of a railway, &amp;c., and, finally, the erection of the really splendid hotel at the terminus. The new building is substantially built of stone, and stands upon a little neck of land which at one time formed a sort of bar at the mouth of the harbour. It is surrounded on three sides by the sea, and though there is sufficient space to allow of a very nice lawn, croquet-ground, &amp;c., on opening the garden gate the visitor is able to walk directly on the shingly beach, which is one of the most beautiful in the island. From every room in the hotel, too, there are most extensive views, embracing to the eastward, Spithead and Portsmouth, and the forts, while looking westward the opposite coast gradually fades into a misty cloud, and looking south the eye wanders along the downs or over the valley of the Yar. A more crommauding position it would not be easy to find. The hotel is worthy of its beautiful surroundings, and does credit to the architect, Mr. Theo. R. Saunders, of Ventnor. The exterior, of stone, is relieved by Bath stone and terra cotta dressings and a porch in the Tuscan style, but more attention has been paid to interior comfort than to meretricious exterior adornment. That no expense has been spared will be understood when we state that the building cost 10,000l. There are upwards of 30 rooms, all large, lofty, and beautifully furnished by Maple and Co., of Tottenham Court-road, London. The bedrooms are large and so arranged that they may be used either as a bed or semi-sitting rooms. Messrs. Ingram and Son, of Ventnor, are the builders. Nothing seems wanting, from the basement to the uppermost story, which can conduce to the comfort of the visitor. The management has been placed in the able hands of Mr. F. W. Scadden, who was messman to the Indian troopship Serapis during the voyage of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales to India, and who, at the end of the voyage, received at the hands of His Royal Highness a valuable watch, as a memento of the journey, and as a proof of the satisfaction he had given in the discharge of his duties.</p>
<p>In celebration of the completion of the undertaking and the opening of the hotel, the directors invited a great number of their friends to a grand luncheon at the hotel on Saturday afternoon. For the accommodation of these ladies and gentlemen, a special train was run from London Bridge, connected with a special steamer at Portsmouth Harbour, and bringing the visitors direct over to Bembridge, the entire journey occupying only two hours and 40 minlutes. It is, we understand, the intention of the London, Brighton, and South-Coast Railway Company to open up a direct passenger communication between London and this part of the island, while in the course of a few months an extensive goods traffic will be opened up, steamers running betwveen Hayling Island and Brading Harbour. The necessary wharves and landing stages are now in course of erection, and will he completed in a very short time. After having been shown over the hotel, about 100 visitors sat down to a <em>recherché</em> luncheon in the coffee-room, which was served in the most complete manner. The chair was taken by Mr. J. Spencer Balfour, M.P., who was supported by Professor Thorold Rogers, M.P., Mr. W. Borlaso. M.P., Colonel B. Galt, Colonel Malone, Messrs. J. B. Bird, J. H. Freeman, J. Bourne, C.E., Cooke, Baines, A. J. de Pass, S. Wright, J. R. Pattison, F.R.S., G. E. Brock, F. T. Bannister, G. T. Porter, R. Hicks, H. Grose Smith, the Rev. Canon Le Mesurier, J. O. Wilkie, J. W. Hobbs, C. Seymour. S. Walker, G. Wright, R. F. Grantham, Howard Brook, James Walker, C.E., H. G. Sumner. Professor Morris, E. A. Freeman, F. Sumner, J. Roberts, F. Walker, T. H. Saunders (architect), Herr Von Spindler, H. Threadingham, W. H. Wooldridge, G. Hirch, Sam Knight, Lieut. F. W. Price, Captain W.L Clayton, &amp;c., and many ladies.— After the luncheon, the CHAIRMAN proposed the loyal toasts, which were most heartily received, the band of the Ventnor detachment of the Isle of Wight Rifle Volunteers, which attended, playing “God Save the Queen”—Mr. BORLASE, M.P., said he haid a toast to propose which he felt would find a fitting response in the hart of every free Englishmnan, and he did not think there had been a time for many years past when the toast would be received with so much enthusiasm and good feeling as now, when we were engaged in a state of affiars in which our Navy had played so important a part. (Cheers.) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Presumably</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">reference</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">[bombardment</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardment_of_Alexandria)</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">*Anglo-Egyptian</span> <span class="pre">War*.]</span></code> If it became necessary for us to go further in the work we had commenced, he was sure that we should find that our Army would do its work equally well. There was a lady present whose brother, Mr. Freeman, was at that moment in Alexandria with that little brave force which had just been landed there. (Applause.) After having alluded to the efficiency of the Volunteer Force, the hon. gentleman concluded by expressing the hope that it would be long, before a fleet anchored at Spithead interfered with the earth works at Bembridge. (Applause.)—Col. E. GALT, in responding, said he should feel it an honour had time allowed, under present circumstances, to dilate upon the patriotic feeling which had been evinced by Great Britian during the present complications. He only hoped there would be found a head to properly guide the destinies of this country, for if so he was sure the arm to execute the plans would be found. (Applause.) He desired to thank the gentlemen who had invited him and so many others to this celebration of the completion of a splendid enterprise, and he wished them. success. (Applanse.)—Capt. CLAYTON proposed the “Houses of Parliament,” and said that, however much they might. differ upon politics, no one could question the hard work which members of Parliament had to perform. When they heard of members sitting for 24 hours at a stretch he felt sure they must all be grateful to them. (Applause.)—Professor THOROLD ROGERS, M.P., whose name had been coupled with the toast, said that if, ashis gallant friend had pointed out, members of Parliament had to work very hard, he could say that they rested very enjoyably. He knew of nothing more pleasant than such an outing as was afforded them that day, when they could get out of the heated atmosphere of Westminster and come down to that pleasant retreat. (Hear, hear.) He felt it was a very kind action on the part of those who had invited them. Not only might they watch here the forces by which the powers of nature were kept in check, but he saw that visitors here would have an opportunity of noticinag those artificial elements which the enterprise of the manager had brought into being. They could hear the eooing of pigeons (laughter), the clucking of hens, the quacking of ducks (laughter), and could even watch, with a sense of perfect rest, the somewhat vapid lives of the oysters. (Laughter and hear.) Everything combined, in this intensely rural retreat, to relieve the mind and to inspire a feeling of contentment. There was no obstruction but that of the wind and the waves, and he hoped the obstruction which these could offer to the success of this undertaking had been finally overcome. (Laughter and applause.)—Mr. PATTERSON proposed “The Bishops and Clergy and the Ministers of Religion.”—The Rev. Canon LE MESURIER responded, and after thanking those present for the hearty manner in which they had received the toast, said that he had watched wvith a great deal of interest the change which this undertaking had produced in the place. Some people had called Bembridge a “one-eyed place,” hut he thought time would prove thot they had two eyes, which were now wide open to the benefits which would accrue from the completion of this great enterprise. (Applause.) He complimented the Company upon the good conduct of the men they had employed. He had never seen any cause to regret their coming there, and he believed they had been the means of affording them great benefits. (Loud appluase.)—The CHIAIRMAN said he now came to the toast of the afternoon, “Success to the Brading Harbour Undertaking, including the ‘ Royal Spithead’ Hotel.” (Loud applause.) With regard to the latter portion, if they had all been so fortunate as to make, as good a luncheon as he had, they would feel that nothing would be wanting on the part of the management to secure it. (Hear, hear.) He was sure they all wished success to that hotel, and that it would long keep its hospitable doors open, and entertain travellers as pleasantly as it had that day. (Applause.) Without going into details which might be found wearisome, he might state that they had been pursuing this undertaking nearly five years. During that period they had encountered almost every difficulty which could have been foreseen, and many difficulties which, under no circumstances, could have been foreseen, and now they stood safely on a sure foundation, having seen the end of their troubles, and beginning to emerge into a mere stable period. They had cause for thankfulness, not merely that a good Provsidence had aided the undertaking, but for the great kindness which they had received from all their friends in the neighbourhood. At first these works were regarded, not perhaps with hostility, but certainly with some amount of dislike. He remembered on one occasion being over at St. Helens, and talking with a fisherman (a very intelligent man), who had been there many years. He (the Chairman) was dwelling with sanguine hope upon the time when there would be a bank across the harbour, a railway, &amp;c. This fisherman replied, ” Ah, it’s a long way across the water, sir,” and he said it in such a manner as to damp all the hopes he had entertained. However, the bank had been made, and the railway had come. He was told the aboriginal inhabitants had concocted a mild sort of pleasantry. They said they hoped their heads would never ache till the railway came. (Laughter.) He hoped their heads had not ached, and he was sure the railway had cured many other aches which must have been endured before—viz., leg aches. (Laughter and applause.) Coming down from London that morning the elements were very unpropitious, and it rained a great deal, but as he was coming down he thought of the experience they had encountered. Through storm and through sunshine, through every possible kind of vicissitude, tribulation, and trouble, they had struggled on to the attainment of the end of these works, and though he did not wish to boast or say one word of self-congratulation, he had seen no history of man’s endeavor undertaken and carried on successfully through more discouragements. At one time he almost lost all hope, and thought the thing would fail, as it had failed in the hands of a greater man (Sir Hugh Middleton) who tried this job, and was supposed by to have succeeded, as they had, when the sea broke in, and all his labour was overthrown. For 200 years engineer after engineer had broached the subject of the reclamation of Brading Harbour, and their were now fortunate enough to see it assured. Their difficulties commenced to pass away and the sun of fortune to shine upon them from the moment their estimable friend Mr. Freeman came to reside there. It was at the hour of darkest night, when all their money seemed destinedto be spent in vain, and all their hopes blasted; at this moment his colleagues and himself thought that, if ever these works were to be carried out, it was necessary to have a master mind, with long experience and intimate knowledge, of these works, and they eventualy came to the conclusion that, if any man could carry these works through, it would be Mr. Freeman. They asked him to como down, and at considerable sacrifices he consented, and the result was what they saw. Therefore, he thought no one had a better right to be coupled with the toast than his dear, long-valued friend, Mr. Freeman. (Applause.)—Mr. FREEMAN, in responding, thanked the Chairman for the compliment he bad been good enough to pay him, but he must say he never would have been able to do what he had if the Chairman and the Company had not so courageously backed him up through thick and thin. (Apolause.) If they had not found the sinews of war so generously no mere resolution on his part would have done anything. (Hear. hear.) The credit they had accorded him might be fairly shared, and now he was thankful to say they had arrived at such a pass that they could sit around that table and fairly congratulate each other on the completion of the work. Tho poet had said:—</p>
<p>Whoever has travelled life’s dull round,<br />
Whatever his fortune may have been.<br />
Has sighed to think he still has found<br />
His warmest welcome at an inn.”</p>
<p>(Hear, hear.) He eas sure they could not be more heartily welcomed than they were at that inn at the present moment. (Hear, hear.)—Mr. FREEMAN then proposed “The health of the Chairman,” who had not referred to the part he had taken in carrying out this work. They could have no idea how important was the help he had rendered, and how much he had done to encourage and carry forward the undertaking. (Applause.)—The toast was warmly received. and briefly responded to by theCHAIRMAN.—Mr. BAINES proposed “The Railway Companies,” specially mentioning the London, Brighton, and South Coast and the Isle of Wight Railways. He was sure they must all wish success to these railways, knowing what they received from them.—Mr. A. J. DE PASS responded, and pointed out that though it rained when they left London, the sun was now shining brightly. Might that be an omen; might prosperity attend them; and might they carry back pleasant reminiscences of the Isle of Wight.—The pleasant meeting then broke up, owing to the necessity of the majority of those present catching the steamer, which, it was feared, if there was any delay,— would not be able to cross the harbour bar.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">New Local Steam Service.— - Thursday, September 14th, 1882</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000290/18820914/003/0002">Portsmouth Evening News</a>, 1882-09-14, p. 2</p>
<p>Owing to the enterprise of some local gentlemen and others connected with the Bembridge Harbour Works Improvement Company, a new and most attractive steam service has just been successfully added to the attractions of tbe Solent, and one, moreover, which opens up some of the loveliest and least known bits of the scenery of the Isle of Wight. The service is at present worked by a new, comfortable, and rapid little vessel, built in Scotland, and appropriately named the Island Queen. She makes trips daily each way, leaving Bembridge Harbour at haif-past eight, half-past one, and a quarter-past four each day, and calling the Chain Pier, Sea View, the South Parade Pier at East Southsea. the Clarence Esplanade Pier, and Portsmouth Harbour. The charges are exceedingly moderate, return tickets being issued at 9d. and 1s 6d. for respectively second and first-class passages; and as the trip is as novel as it is really enjoyable, the steamer will doubtless become very popular. Yesterday a party consisting of the journalists of Portsmouth, bank managers, and other gentlemen who are interested in the development of the trade and prosperity of Portsmouth and Southsea, went over by invitation of the company and were much struck with the evidence that met their eyes of the enormous sum of money that is now being spent in the improvement of the east end of the island. Leaving out of question the symmetrical pier and other works at and around that beautiful spot, Sea View, we will confine ourselves chiefly to the marvellous transformation which has been wrought at Bembridge the Harbour Works and Improvement Company, under the supervision of Mr. Spencer Balfour, M. P., Mr. Freeman (who, regret to say, breathed his last a few days ago), and Mr. Walker, the very clever resident engineer of the company. Here, where all few months ago was waste of mud and sand and water, are now 700 acres of land reclaimed to the plough, a railway along which runs a well-appointed train to meet the main liae traffic Brading, and which calls at St. Helens en route; an exceedingly commodious and well arranged quay, where most of the cargoes of coal, timber, ami general merchandise for Ryde, Shanklin, Ventnor, and Brading are landed. The works also include the deepening of Bembridge Harbour, and the construction through the reclaimed land of a channel for the river Yar, a stream that drains about a third of the Island. The whole of these great works have been constructed in the most solid and efficient manner and they do infinite credit the engineer, Mr Walter. Close to the pier where the Island Queen lands her passengers, and close also to the new railway station, a commodious and elegantly fitted hotel has been erected and opened under the management Mr. Scadden, whose name as a successful caterer and careful host is so well known in Portsmouth and its neighbouring towns. A golf club has also been formed here, which already numbers fifty members, and no effort will be spared to render Bembridge one of the favourite resorts of the Isle of Wight. An idea of the value of much of the land that has been reclaimed may be formed from the fact that au expert in the employ of the Messrs. Sutton, the well-known seedsmen, estimates that it will require no manure for twenty years. A first crop of oats has just been threshed out with a surprisingly satisfactory result. Some large and well-arranged oyster beds have been established and other portions of the newly-created estate are gigantic beds of such choice vegetables as asparagus and seakale. It will thus be gathered that an exceedingly valuable property is being rapidly created, and people are already beginning to ask themselves how so very promising a field has been permitted to lie fallow for so long, but it seems that an unsuccessful effort to do what has now been accomplished was made two hundred and fifty years ago by Sir Hugh Middleton, who made the New River Waterworks in London. Under his direction a number of Dutch labourers were brought oyer from Holland on the supposition that they would prove to be especially qualified for the work, but they failed, and the failure seems to have deterred others from the undertaking until the successful effort which we now announce. In addition to the railway from Brading to Bembridge a carriage drive 35ft. wide has been constructed between the same points. After viewing the works, which we have attempted thus hastily to describe, and also a pretty acacia avenue for which the place is celebrated, and other points of interest, the party were hospitably entertained by Scadden at the Royal Spithead Hotel, and returned to Portsmouth delighted and impressed by successful effort thus been made to add to theattractiveness of the locality. Full particulars as to the sailing of the Island Queen may be obtained on the Portsmouth side at either of the piers.</p>

<p>The reclamation of land from the sea has always been more or less an enterprise of a difficult character, though it has frequently proved successful. As far back as 1678 the expanse of Brading Harbour, Isle of Wight, was first reclaimed but the sea twice made inroads through the banks. Later an attempt was made by Sir Hugh Myddleton, but again the force of water proved too much for the barrier which was built to check it. About twenty years ago Jabez Balfour secured the estate and built a strong sea wall, formed a harbour constructed a railway, built gas and waterworks, and erected a fine hotel on the sea front. Since that time , about five hundred and twenty acres of land have been gradually brought under a state of cultivation, and this land, together with a building estate of some twenty-eight acres, was sold by auction by Messrs. Douglas Young and Co. yesterday. Over three hundred persons were conveyed by special train and steamer to Bembridge, and the whole of the lots offered were disposed of, the total sale amounting to £13,890, a result which was apparently considered highly satisfactory by the vendors.</p>

<div><p>A Short History of The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club
Published by the club, circa 1922 - with some small changes for ease of reading. This account is of the early days of the club and formed the main part of a pamphlet which set out its history.</p>
<p>The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club can be said to have originated at a luncheon party held at the Royal Spithead Hotel in the spring of 1882, when to the assembled company that popular sportsman, Captain Jack Eaton R.N. suddenly proposed: “What was the Duver meant for?”</p>
<p>The party hazarded various suggestions, but Jack Easton would accept none of them crying out himself “It was made on purpose for golf”. So across the harbour the party went and had explained to them the intricacies of a game which was at that time unknown in England, save to a few enthusiasts who played at Blackheath, Wimbledon and Westward Ho!</p>
<p>Jack Eaton’s enthusiasm quickly spread to his hearers, and almost before the tour of the Duver was over, they had promised one and all to become members of the new club, which it was decided to call the Isle of Wight Golf Club.</p>
<p>A man of action, this commander of the eastern division of the Isle of Wight Coastguards very soon obtained a lease of the ground from the Brading Harbour Company, and it was not long after the date of the luncheon party that men were set to work under the supervision of experts “with strong Gaelic dialects“ to root up and cut down the gorse bushes, level the ground and transport freshly cut turf from the downs to the projected greens.
Naturally, the interest of the islanders was evoked in this new and wonderful game, and the preparations being made for the playing of it. Speculation as to the nature of the game ran high, some thinking it would be a sort of new kind of croquet, others that it would reveal itself as a form of dignified hockey with a touch of polo on foot. Both conceptions were about as far from the truth as that of an engineer of a steam yacht at that time in the harbour who “knowed it was worked somehow by steam, ‘cos he heard ‘em a talking’ about the best drive, and where the bunkers were to be.”</p>
<p>The list of members slowly but steadily increased, and no inconsiderable gathering of people was present at the opening ceremony. The honour of driving the first ball fell to a Mrs Hambrough, wife of the club’s first captain, Dudley A. Hambrough, and she acquitted herself well in what must have been something of a trying ordeal. In strict truthfulness it must be recorded that at the first match the interest of many spectators was directed not so much at the players as at one of the caddies , who was a very pretty barmaid from the Royal Spithead Hotel.</p>

<p>At a meeting held at the Marine Hotel, Ventnor, on July 31, a golf club was formed for the island, to be called the Isle of Wight Golf Club. The club have secured an excellent ground at St. Helens, where a beautiful course of nine holes will be made.

<p>This club, which has been estalished in connection with the Royal Spithead Hotel here, held its first autumn meeting on Thursday. Unfortunately the weather was totally against good scoring. Eight couples started to compete for the prizes, consisting of a gold medal, presented by Mr C. Tottenham ; a claret jug, presented by Mrs Henley Grose Smith ; and a set of gold clubs and one dozen balls presented by the club. On examining the cards it was found there was a tie between Captain Corse Scott and Mr R. B. Molesworth at 95 strokes for the Tottenham gold medal, and, on playing off the tie, Mr Molesworth won, doing the round in 88 strokes. Captain C. Scott, with a gross score of 95, reduced by an allowance of 8 to 87, carried off Mrs H. Grose Smith’s much coveted prize. The set of clubs was won by Captain Eaton, R.N., with a score of 99 reduced by an allowance of 2 to 97, and the prize of golf balls was won by Mr A. J.

<p>To the Editor of the Isle of Wight Observer.
Sir, — I observe in your issue of last Saturday, in reference to the Isle of Wight Golf Club, that it is stated that the club is in connection with the Royal Spithead Hotel, Bembridge. As this is in no way the case, I shall be much obliged by your correcting the statement in your next issue. The Golf Club merely holds its dinners, &amp;c, there, and of course it is the natural place for members from a distance to stay at when visiting the Island for golf. Yours faithfully, J. P.

The distinguished honour thus conferred upon the club comes most opportunely when we are celebrating the anniversary of its creation.

The ground steadily improves under the able direction of J. Beveridge, the custodian, and his brother Daniel, who are at the same time second to none in the art of club making. His Royal Highness’ s early departure from the Island has precluded the possibility of a visit to Bembridge, but it is hoped that at no distant date the club may be honourod by a visit, when Their Royal and Serene Highnesses will receive a true golfer’s welcome.</p>

RULES FOR THE GAME OF GOLF
THE ROYAL ISLE OF WIGHT GOLF CLUB</p>
<p>[Commentary: An early attempt at a universal rules code (“…shall suit all greens alike.”) from the now defunct Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club.
A remarkable document; well laid out, well written and more comprehensive than any other code of the time.
This code introduced definitions, out of bounds, hole size (albeit at 4 inches) and other concepts later incorporated in the R&amp;A codes.]</p>

The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club can be said to have originated at a luncheon party held at the Royal Spithead Hotel in the spring of 1882, when to the assembled company that popular sportsman, Captain Jack Eaton R.N. suddenly proposed: “What was the Duver meant for?”
The party hazarded various suggestions, but Jack Easton would accept none of them crying out himself “It was made on purpose for golf”. So across the harbour the party went and had explained to them the intricacies of a game which was at that time unknown in England, save to a few enthusiasts who played at Blackheath, Wimbledon and Westward Ho!
Jack Eaton’s enthusiasm quickly spread to his hearers, and almost before the tour of the Duver was over, they had promised one and all to become members of the new club, which it was decided to call the Isle of Wight Golf Club.
A man of action, this commander of the eastern division of the Isle of Wight Coastguards very soon obtained a lease of the ground from the Brading Harbour Company, and it was not long after the date of the luncheon party that men were set to work under the supervision of experts “with strong Gaelic dialects“ to root up and cut down the gorse bushes, level the ground and transport freshly cut turf from the downs to the projected greens.
Naturally, the interest of the islanders was evoked in this new and wonderful game, and the preparations being made for the playing of it. Speculation as to the nature of the game ran high, some thinking it would be a sort of new kind of croquet, others that it would reveal itself as a form of dignified hockey with a touch of polo on foot. Both conceptions were about as far from the truth as that of an engineer of a steam yacht at that time in the harbour who “knowed it was worked somehow by steam, ‘cos he heard ‘em a talking’ about the best drive, and where the bunkers were to be.”
The list of members slowly but steadily increased, and no inconsiderable gathering of people was present at the opening ceremony. The honour of driving the first ball fell to a Mrs Hambrough, wife of the club’s first captain, Dudley A. Hambrough, and she acquitted herself well in what must have been something of a trying ordeal. In strict truthfulness it must be recorded that at the first match the interest of many spectators was directed not so much at the players as at one of the caddies , who was a very pretty barmaid from the Royal Spithead Hotel.
These were but interludes in the development of the club, which each month added to its membership and on September 18th 1883 a letter was received from the Secretary of State intimating he had “had the honour to submit to the Queen you (the Secretary’s) request that the Isle of Wight Golf Club may be permitted to assume the title of ‘Royal ‘and that Her Majesty has been graciously please to accede to your request and to command that the Club be styled the ‘Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club’.”
With the bestowal of this royal patronage, the reputation of the club was still further enhanced and so many more members enrolled, that a special private room at the hotel had to be reserved for their special use. It may be remarked that this patronage has been extended by the royal family until the present day. The late King Edward was patron of the club until his death and our present King has been patron since his ascension in 1910. H.R.H. Prince Henry of Battenburg was captain for the years 1894-1895, and his two sons, Prince Leopold and Prince Maurice, are both Hon. Members at the present time.
The yearly crowdings at the two hotels resulted in the roof of the Royal Spithead Hotel being raised and another storey added, and this accommodation was further supplemented by a new private room which was built at a later date for the club members.
The plan shows how well and naturally the holes are laid out, giving a good length (2891 yards) width, and variety of holes, on such a relatively small area of ground. In fact it is doubtful if there is to be found anywhere, nine more attractive and varied holes in such a small compass; and yet despite its size, it will be found in playing (with a bogey of 37) to be a most enjoyable and difficult test of golf.
The natural hazards are sand dunes and hillocks, gorse, sea boundaries, and a public road, which round diagonally across the links, coming into prominence at 4 holes 1, 5, 6 and 9, and in a minor ways at the 8th, off a poorly played shot.
The three long holes, 1st, 8th and 9th are good three shot ones, in anything but calm, dry weather! The 3rd and 4th and 6th are superlative “fours” and would be hard to beat by comparison anywhere. The 2nd, 5th and 7th are very good and varied one shot holes, and of different length and difficulty and the 7th being a particularly clever punchbowl shot. Altogether the course is one of the most interesting nine hole in existence, and is full of character and individuality throughout, with the possible exception of the 5th, which is perhaps rather insipid and weak, but necessary, to keep up the proper sequence of play. This hole however together with the 6th are the only two remaining holes of the original course, as laid in 1892. That is to say they have been in constant play with little alterations for 47 years.
The links and clubhouse are situated on The Duver, St Helens, Isle of Wight, 4 minutes by ferry boat to Bembridge Station, Southern Railway, 10 minutes to St Helen’s Station via the Mill Pond Walk and Harbour Yards; 20 minutes by a good “bus service to Ryde and Sea View from St Helen’s Village.

The ladies course had 18 short holes with natural bunkers. The pavillion acted as the clubhouse as well. Gentlemen were allowed to play the course, so long as they were accompanied by a lady.</p>

The Spithead Hotel opened in 1882. In the same year the railway was extended to Bembridge, (the station was on the opposite side of the road) and with a new pier for steamers, the hotel was well positioned for visitors.q
Royal patronage was granted to the hotel in the following year, 1883
The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club, on the sand dunes across the harbour, was established by visitors to the hotel, the hotel was also popular with visitors to nearby Bembridge Sailing Club.
The hotel was demolished in 1989 and the site redeveloped.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">CLOSING PUBLIC-HOUSES ON SUNDAY. - Thursday, July 10th, 1879</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002100/18790710/110/0005">Isle of Wight Times</a>, 1879-07-10, p. 5</p>
<p>The Mayor said that the next matter on the agenda was a motion by himself and he hoped that they would all give their adhesion to it. That butchers, bakers, grocers, tailors, and candlestick makers, should not be allowed to sell on Sundays, and that publicans should be allowed to sell intoxicating liquors on Sundays had always been a marvel to him. A large number of publicans would only be too glad to close their hones if they could. He thought that as the Governing body of the town they ought to shew their respect for the Sabbath-day by trying to close public-houses. When they considered the number of people that public-houses kept at work on the Sabbath he thought they would see that there was good reason why such houses should be shut up. He proposed the following resolution:—” That the seal of the Borough be of to a petition to Parliament for closing Public-houses on Sundays.”</p>
<p>Councillor PURNIILL seconded the resolution.</p>
<p>Alderman Wallis said he could not support the resolution, on the ground that it was an Imperial measure and had nothing whatever to do with Corporation matters. It was bringing a party question before the Council. Suppose for instance that Councils were to take up the abolition of flogging in the army, it would be said at once that the Conservatives were trying to carry and the Liberals to stop it. If the matter were brought before the town of Ryde it would wear a different aspect. He did not mean to say that the petition came from the Mayor.</p>
<p>The MAYOR said he should be very proud of it if it had.</p>
<p>Councillor Spenser said he should record his vote against the resolution for the reasons advanced by Alderman Wallis. He thought it would be a great pity for the Council to deal in party politics. He did not think that public-houses should be shut on Sundays, but publicans had a right to shut the shops up if liked. (The Mayor said they were obliged to open at certain hours.) It was at their option to apply for a licence to enable them to do so. It was all very well for gentlemen, like the Mayor, who might have their cask of ale and wine cellar, but the poor man could not do that. The Mayor had said that public-houses being open on the Sunday was a nuisance. (The Mayor replied that he used no such word.) Councillor Spencer replied if the Mayor did not use that word he led them to suppose that they were so. Of course the Mayor knew that his motion would be opposed. It must eventually become a question of party politics— (The Mayor :—” No, Never.”)— It must eventually become a measure of that sort and he did not think that it should be introduced there.</p>
<p>Councillor Purnell remarked that the question was one which lay at their own doors and was really a town question. For public-houses to be open on the Sabbath was a great nuisance. He questioned whether it was the poor man who most used the public-house, on the Sunday, or whether it was the middle class. He thought that it was the beet movement that the Mayor had brought forward since he bad known him, and he would support it with both hands and stand up three times to do so.</p>
<p>Councillor James thought that he might stand between the two parties at that Council, for was he not prejudiced against the publicans, nor yet a total abstainer. He could not vote for the resolution because he did not think that it ought to be brought forward there. He had thought this matter over, and they bad to remember that there were thousands who could only come out of the large towns on the Sunday, and it would be a certain amount of hardship on them if the houses were all closed. He would say that the members of that Council ought to set an example. He was not going to sign any petition for they were living in a free country. He stayed away from public. houses, but he did not say to his neighbours they should not go. He admitted that there were too many licensed houses in the town, but at the same time the magistrates had not taken away a single license from the place. The Mayor had not done so aver since he had been Chief Magistrate. He understood that the power to do so was in the magistrates’ hands, and to take away new licenses.</p>
<p>The MAYOR : Unfortunately it is not, and not one of the old ones unless it is endorsed.</p>
<p>Councillor Newbald said it would scarcely be right to close public-houses and to leave hotels open.</p>
<p>Alderman Colenutt said that he could not understand how this could be looked upon as a question of Imperial policy, nor yet how it arose. If they wanted to get into a squabble between Tories and Reformers, then they could try it as question of policy, or as a question of Parsons and publicans, or so on (Laughter). [Alderman FUTCHER : That is the very thing the question arises out of.] It was a question which affected the social condition of the people, and that was to a certain extent entrusted to the care of the Municipal Authorities. If power were given to the Municipal Authorities, over the individual, to regulate moral conduct, and to deal with drunkenness, it was quite legitimate for the Town Council to deal with the question they had before them, and to regulate the vendors of the article which produced such mischief in the country. Intoxicating drinks terribly affected the best interests of their country’. He had had to do with workingmen, and in almost every case where they found mothers and their families not properly cared for, or in a state of distress, it was through the husband improperly using intoxicating drinks. There was the the greater temptation to men to use those drinks on the Sunday. There was an old saying that “Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do,” and they found the working-man often waiting on the Sunday for the public-houses to open. Who were the parties who suffered the most? Why the poor women and their children, who would not suffer so much if those houses were not open on the Sunday. It appeared to him, therefore, that this was a social question and if they could cause a reformation and induce people to drink lees it would produce a social benefit. He thought that they should ask Parliament to enact such laws as would lessen crime, and the degradation and expense, which that crime was sure to bring on to their country. He could not for a moment suppose that it was a question of Imperial politics, and he could only believe that his friend on the right had raised that point only to frighten them. Parliament had entrusted them with power over many matters, which affected them in their moral relations, and their social relations with one another, and therefore he thought that they should deal with the question as a means to prevent the commission of crime.</p>
<p>Alderman HARRINGTON remarked that drunkenness was such a prevalent crime and was of such blighting consequences and so affecting the prospects of their country that he was afraid that it was leading them below the position which they ought to occupy. That the question before them was an Imperial question he fully admitted, and the making of it a matter of party polities was one great cause why the Liberals lost their seats. They shortened the publican’s hours by an hour, and the feeling was so great, that he knew thousands, well he said thousands (nationally) but he knew several (locally), who voted against them on that account.</p>
<p>Alderman Colenutt spoke about intoxicating drink being a luxury, and there was no doubt that it was a luxury, for there was not the slightest nourishment in it. If gentlemen with means could afford to indulge in luxuries, he did not know that they could say much against them. Setting that aside, under the unfortunate public-house system the poor man went and spent that which would support his wife and family and by so doing brougut them to degradation. No man was worthy of the name of a man who neglected his wife and children, in order to indulge in a degrading luxury. That it tended to party politics to a very considerable extent there was no doubt whatever. It was a social, a personal, a domestic, and a religious question. If a man got drunk it was a personal question, for if it were in his own house, in the bosom of his own family, the law could not touch him. It was then a social question, but the law could touch him if he got drunk and went into the public road, for he then become a nuisance. The only influence that could be brought to bear, to stop the use of intoxicating drink, and the sad things resulting from it, was the religious influence. To shew men that they were going against the laws of God. If it were found in other countries, that religion prevented drunkenness, why should it not there? The Clergy and Ministers of England were to blame for the crime that existed.—(Councillor Purnell “Question.”)—Look ut the Jews, they confined themselves to certain sorts of meat because their religion taught them to do it. The Mahomedans abstained from intoxicating drink because their religion kept them from it. He did not see why the Christian religion, which was far superior to all others, should not produce a similar influence. This was the only way to stop this evil. In Scotland, where public-houses were kept closed, on Sundays, men would sit at home and drink whiskey “toddy” till they could not move. Scotland was one of the most drunken countries in the world. (Voices, “No ! No ! No ! ” ” Hear, Hear “.) He was afraid that the resolution would lead to a great deal of sly drunkenness. It was such a burning question throughout the country that he should support the cause. He should like very much to see the licensing power transferred from the magistrates to local governing, bodies like the Council; not only fur renewing licenses, but to stop them and to have full control over intoxicating drink. Refer it to the Watch Committee, and let them give instructions to the police; the committee to have power to appoint persons annually. It was very serious that there should be 143,000,000 of money spent yearly in drink, and must very seriously injure their country. There was a Committee formed in the House of Commons on the present agricultural depression, (laughter). They might laugh if they liked, but it was a very serious matter and from drink and a variety of circumstances they were rather a descending nation. It was said that this was a free country. Yes ; and everybody was free to go to the Devil their own way, if they liked, (laughter).</p>
<p>Councillor RIDDETT thought they were now wasting their time in discussing such a question as a whole.</p>
<p>Alderman Colenutt replied that no question effecting the interest of people was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Councillor Riddett said when marriage with the deceased wife’s sister was brought up he protested against it and he protested against the present subject as being one equally beyond the province of the Council. If they were to introduce social questions of that kind they would bo going dreadfully beyond their province. He had a good deal of sympathy with the movement and he wished to decrease the intemprance of the country and to secure to all classes the Sabbath Day as a day of rest, but he was not prepared to vote for a resolution, which he considered very wide indeed, and which would imply a great deal that they ought not to carry without further interest being considered outside those of public-houses. It was not because ho did not agree with the principle of the resolution.</p>
<p>Alderman DASHWOOD remarked that if anybody could shew or attempt to show, that the evil arising from intemperance were not greater than all others put together then there would be a reason for asking him not to support the resolution, but one gentleman said ” my sympathies go one way, but my votes must go another,” and yet he had not told them why. It was quite reasonable they should. For he had no doubt that gentlemen who considered it an Imperial question understood the reason very well why certain parties talked one way and voted another. He was not a teetotaller, but it was a question of keeping the Sabbath without desecration and what tended to desecrate it more than the way public-houses were kept open. Some one said it was quite optional to have a six day’s licenae, but that was quite a mistake for 95 per cent of the public-houses were in the hands of the brewers and persons had to take their licenses as they were handed to them.</p>
<p>The mayor said he never was so much surprided in his life as when he heard this talked about as being a question of part y polities and Imperial question. Such an idea never came across his mind when he put the notice on the <em>agenda</em>. If he had thought so he certainly should not have raised it, but he looked upon it as one that concerned the welfare of that Borough and no farther. He was astonished at Councillor Riddett saying that his sympathies were with the question of temperance and yet he could not support the petition. It was an enigma to him.</p>
<p>Councillor Riddett explained his meaning, which the Mayor said was the same thing.</p>
<p>Councillor ALLEN said he must be another enigma.</p>
<p>The Mayor said it dad been said that Scotland was the most drunken place in the world, but he denied it in toto. In Ireland, where public-bowies were shut up the whole of the Sabbaths they would find that the decreased percentage of crime was so very marked that it could not leave a doubt on any reasonable man’s mind of the good effects of closing such houses.</p>
<p>He put the resolution to the meeting. Councillors Ellery, Gunn, and Newbold left the room previously to the vote being given. Alderman Wallis and Councillors Riddett, Allen, James, Spencer, Dixon and Sweetman voted against the resolution. The ten other members voted in the affirmative and the Mayor declared the resolution carried. The Borough seal was then affixed to the petition, which was ordered to be forwarded to the proper quarter.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000170/18790712/012/0006">Isle of Wight Observer</a>, 1879-07-12, p. 6</p>
<p>A meeting of the Council was held on Tuesday afternoon, when there were present the Mayor (Alderman B. Barrow) ; Aldermen, Wallis, Colenutt, Futcher, Harrington, and Dashwood ; Councillors Newbald, Riddett, Whittington, Allen, James, Spencer, Ellery, Barton, Dixon, Purnell, Comden, Sweetman, and Marvin.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>CLOSING OF PUBLIC HOUSES ON SUNDAYS.</p>
<p>The Mayor said the next proposition was the one he had placed on the agenda paper himself, and with which he hoped the Council would acquiesce. It had long been the custom for the baker, grocer, and the other traders to close their establishments on Sunday, the only exception to the general rule were the publicans, and why they should keep open for the convenience of travellers, or pretended travellers, he could never understand. They could not, having regard to the enormous increase of drunkenness in the country of late years, refuse to take into consideration such an important question as the closing of publichouses on the Sunday. After the great number of signatures appended to the petition which he was about to read to them, he thought it would only be right for the Council also to show what their feeling was in the matter. If it was only the keepers of the publichouses who were concerned in this, there might be some reason why they should continue the present state of things, but there were barmen and barwomen constantly employed behind the bar, with no opportunity of a days rest, and exposed to a great deal of evil. He therefore begged to move that the seal of the Corporation be affixed to the petition to Parliament (read) for closing publichouses on Sundays.</p>
<p>Mr. Barton seconded.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallis said he could not support this resolution. He had nothing to say on the merits of the petition, but he opposed on the ground that this was and Imperial measure and had nothing to do with our municipal institutions at all. This was the ground taken by Mr. Pittis in a similar discussion in the Town Council at Newport. The discussion of anything outside the ordinary municipal work before them he considered was very undesirable. This was opening up a party question, such as was likely to evoke party feeling in the members of the Town Council, which ought never to be done. Supposing they were asked to seal a petition in favour of the abolition of the flogging in the army, such could not fail to evoke party feeling inasmuch as the Conservatives were determined to carry it through and the others to stop it, and the question now before them would become a party question in a similar way. It would not matter if the members of the Town Council signed in their ordinary capacity, but to seal the petition with the seal of the Corporation he considered was very undesirable. This was got up by the temperance party, for he did not believe the Mayor got it up himself, and as he thought it was needlessly introducing the ques- tion of party politics he should vote against it.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer said that he too should vote against it for the reasons advanced by the last speaker. He was not aware that he was elected by the burgesses to discuss any question of this sort, and he thought it was very unwise to bring such questions before the Town Council. On the merits of the petition too he must say that he should be inclined to vote against it as he saw no reason for altering the pre- sent law. The publican could close bis house on Sunday now if he chose.</p>
<p>The Mayor.— They are bound to keep open certain hours.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer said they had the option, if they chose, of taking out six days’ licences. It was also very well for gentlemen who had a wine cellar and kept a their ales and spirits indoors to talk in this manner All they had to do was to tell the butler to bring up a bottle when they thought they would like one. The poor man could not do that, and he should say to gentlemen like the Mayor who took up this question, ” You wish to deprive the poor man of a luxury which you indulge in yourself.” If the public houses were such a nuisance as the Mayor implied ———</p>
<p>The Mayor.— I never said so. I never said they were a nuisance.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer. — Well if you did not make use of the exact words that was evidently your meaning.</p>
<p>The Mayor. — Excuse me, I never said anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer. — The very fact of your desiring to send such a petition as this shows that you regard publichouses as nuisances. It is perfectly plain to me that was your moaning, and if you bring forward such a motion as this we have a right to say that we don’t regard publichouses quite in the same light as you do. You did not expect to bring this before the Council and get it passed without some opposition, did you : and I suppose we have a right to express our opinion.</p>
<p>The Mayor. — You are very unfair. I never said or hinted that anything was a nuisance, nor did I suppose that I was going to thrust this dowu the throats of the Council without hearing their opinion, I novcr said anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer. — Well I understood just so. He would not vote for this, for the reasons given by Mr. Wallis. They might as well have a petition in favour of the Tichborne Claimant, or the Army Discipline Bill, or thousands of other matters, it all came to the same thing eventually. This must become a question oi party politics (uo). Unless this matter wore taken up by a party it would be useless to expect, private members to do so. Therefore he did not see what use it was to send the petition.</p>
<p>Mr. Purnell said that flogging in the Army and the Tichborne trial were very different to this. There was no comparison, for they did net come within their experience, while the other thing was right in their midst. He should think indeed that they had something to do with it ; it was really a town question. He should like those who opposed to live the same as he had done opposite to a public-house open on Sunday, and they would see whether it was a nuisance or not. As for Mr. Spencer saying that the publicans could close now, why the brewers would not let them. If they could he believed they would all shut up. He thought it was a capital motion, in fact the best motion the Mayor had brought forward since he had known him (hear, hear, and laughter).</p>
<p>Mr. James said that he stood midway between some of the last speakers and the teetotallers. He had not entered a publichouse himself on Sunday for 20 years, but yet he should be very sorry to curtail his neighbour’s liberty in that respect. He considered this an imperial question, and as he had voted before against the discussion of imperial topics there, he should do so now. He should like to know exactly what was a publichouse. Were refreshment bars at railways to be closed? for if so, an immense amount of hardship would be entailed on a great many. He thought there were too many publichouses now, but he was bound to admit that during the five years the Mayor had sat on the bench he had not once refused to renew one of their licenses.</p>
<p>The Mayor. — Unfortunately, no. We can only refuse to grant new ones, not old ones.</p>
<p>Mr. Newbald did not see why they should attempt to close publichouses. Why not attempt to close clubs also on Sundays ?</p>
<p>Alderman Colenutt <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[misattributed;</span> <span class="pre">corrected</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">week</span> <span class="pre">later</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Alderman</span> <span class="pre">Harringotn]</span></code> did not see how this could be called a question of imperial politics ; it was rather a social one. He should think that the social condition of the people was to some extent of interest to municipal authorities, and if Parliament gave municipal authorities power to deal with drunkenness, it was quite legitimate for a Town Council to interfere as regards the vending of an article which did so much damage. It might be said that he had trafficked himself in the article, but he never sold any on a Sunday, and was not aware that his business ever profited by Sunday trading. One speaker had called drink a luxury. All he could say was that it would be a good thing if the luxury did not bring so much poverty and misery in its train. He had been acquainted with many working men, and in almost every instance where you found distress and that the family of children were not cared for, you could trace it to drink. There was a greater temptation for men to drink on Sunday than any other day, and he considered the closing of publichouses therefore would be productive of social benefit.</p>
<p>Alderman Harrington also supported in a lengthy speech, in the course of which he said that this question of temperance ought to be made a religious question, and he believed the clergy and ministers of England were largely to blame for the amount of crime we had (“question,” and Mr. Newbald walked out in an abrupt and suggestive manner). In the course of some lengthy remarks, Mr. Harrington referred to the temperance of the Mahometans, said Scotland was the most drunken country to be found (” question”), and gave some valuable statistical information as to exports and imports. We had been descending rather than rising with regard to our general state of prosperity, and one serious cause of this he believed to be drink. He was not a teetotaller. [Mr. Spencer : Then you ought to be.] He thought there was too much freedom now. Every one was free to go to the devil his own way, but for himself he should like to see that liberty curtailed.</p>
<p>Mr. Riddett said that viewing the extent of ground over which the last speaker travelled showed the danger they ran in wasting their time by the discus- sion of such questions. [Alderman Harrington (indignantly). — Be careful what you are talking about !] He did not specially refer to the last speaker.</p>
<p>Alderman Colenutt. — Any discussion of such an important social question as this cannot be called waste of time.</p>
<p>Alderman Harrington. — The youngest member in the room telling me such a thing ! I won’t have it.</p>
<p>Mr. Riddett said almost the first question he was called upon to discuss when he entered the Council was whether marriage with a deceased wife’s sister ought to be legalised. He expressed his opinion then that in discussing such questions they were going away from legitimate business. He might say that he had great sympathy with the efforts which were now being made to lessen intemperance and to secure to all classes a Sabbath day of rest. He thought, however, that legislation should be very cautious in this matter, and he was not prepared to vote suddenly in such a wide question which touched other interests besides those of the publichouse keepers. He would not say, however, that he had no sympathy with the principle of the resolution.</p>
<p>Alderman Dashwood said that if any one could show him that the evils arising from intemperance were not greater than all causes put together then there would be some reason for asking him not to support this resolution. How gentlemen could shelter themselves from their responsibility of givuv a vote he could not understand. Nor coidd he understand how one gentleman could get up and say “My sympathy goes one way but my vote goes another.”</p>
<p>Mr. Riddett. — Who said so ?</p>
<p>Alderman Dashwood.— You.— He was not a tee-totaller, for he was not prejudiced against a good glass of wine.</p>
<p>Mr. James.— Then you ought to be. You want to do away with it.</p>
<p>Alderman Dashwood said it was as much a question of keeping Sunday undescrated as anything else. What could be greater desecration of the Sabbath than to see all these public houses open ? As for saying it was optional with the publicans, and they could get six days’ licences if they liked, it was nothing of the sort. Quite 95 per cent, of the publichouses were in the hands of the brewers, and the publicans had to sell as much beer as he possibly could, and many of this class had told him how glad they would be if they could close on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Mayor said that no idea of party or imperial politics ever crossed his mind when he placed this motion the agenda. He considered it a social question which concerned this borough as it concerned every other. They might just as well deny the right of the Watch Committee to interfere with police, who were under the supervision of the Imperial Governmeut, as their right to speak and discuss a question like that before them. Of all the speakers, however, the one who had astonished him most was Mr. Riddett, who told him that his sympathy went in support of the petition but that he should vote against it. That to him was an enigma which he would not attempt to explain.</p>
<p>Mr. Riddett said that the Mayor had misreprepresented him. What he did say was that although he had sympathy with those who were endeavouring to get rest for the Sabbath Day, he should not support this unless other interests besides those of publicans’ houses were considered.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen.— I merely rise to say that I shall be another ” enigma ” Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p>The Mayor said that Mr. Riddett seemed to have expressed just the same idea as before. If there was anything destructive of the morality and reli- gion of the country he believed it was the drunkenness which was brought about by publichouses bemg kept open on the Sunday. He would close (it he had his way) every publichouse from 9 o’clock on Saturday till Monday morning. As to what had been said about preventing the poor man enjoying a luxury which the rich could not, that was a baby argument (laughter), because if they wanted beer they could buy it over night and bottle it. He had heard it said that Scotland was the most drunken country He denied it in toto. Ireland had been, but if they would only take the statistics of crime in Irish town- where they had closed the publichouses on Sunday, the per centage of crime was so much less that no one could doubt as to the good effects of closing those houses.</p>
<p>He then put the motion, which was carried. For it— The Mayor, Aldermen Colenutt, Futcher, Harrington, Dashwood, Whittington, Marvin, Purnell Barton, and Com Jen. Messrs. Gunn and Newbald had left, and those remaining were against.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">RYDE, THURSDAY, JULY 17, 1879. - Thursday, July 17th, 1879</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002100/18790717/088/0004">Isle of Wight Times</a>, 1879-07-17, p. 4</p>
<p>The course which the Ryde Town Council took last week, with regard to the petition in favour of closing publichouses on Sundays, must have met with the approbation of the majority of our fellow-townsmen, and of many of the publicans also. The general feeling of the meeting exhibited by those who dissented from the petition being sealed, was in favour of the movement, but their objection was on the ground that it was a matter of Imperial and not of local politics. This seemed a correct view to take, inasmuch, as the principle implied in the Premissive Bill has not yet been legislatively brought into the law of England, over the sale of intoxicating beverages. On the other hand it was urged, on quite as good a basis, that the matter was not yet a question of party polities, but one which seriously affected our social interest : that the question was not one of Imperial politics even, so much as essentially a social one, and that moreover, open public-houses on the Sunday very seriously deteriorated the value of property. Many of the argument. brought forward, although, everyway applicable to manufacturing towns, had locally but little weight. The population of Ryde and its neighbourhood being a highclass one and, therefore, not subjected to the too prevalent bad habits of workingmen. On reading the report, which we published last week, it is easy to see that the subject was one which affected individual and pocket interests, as well as the social well-being of our Borough, but the neutrality of Councillors. Ellery, Gunn, and Newbald, placed the majority of the votes on the side of law and order. We cannot help thinking that the most important speech, during the late discussion, was that of Alderman Harrington, which in our last report, unfortunately, by an accident, was attributed to Alderman Colenutt. He looked on intoxicating beverages as luxuries, and such undoubtedly they are, and the most expensive of the present age. He reviewed it from a social, personal, domestic, and religious, point of view, and put forward the important suggestion hat the Corporate bodies of the Kingdom should have full control over licensed houses, instead of the Magistrate. If, however, this course were pursued there would be the great danger that the publican interest would be more rampant than under the present system. In the majority of English towns it is the publican interest that secures the election of anti-teetotal candidates at municipal and general elections. The position the Mayor assumed was not that the control of the liquor traffic is not an Imperial question, for that is, at once, self-evident to anyone, but that in no sense did he look upon it locally as a question of Parliamentary, or of Party Politics, when the sanctity of the Sabbath is concerned. This seemed misunderstood by some of the members of the Council, for no good man would attempt to call into question the correctness of this view of the matter. When Alderman Harrington said that it was a subject to be dealt with by the ” religious influence” he took up a strong position, and if this course were but followed up by the clergy of all denominations, there would soon be no need for the interference of the Government, for Sunday custom would become speedily extinct and publicans would close their houses when there was no longer any demand. A most important part of the subject is the Sunday labour, which is entailed on so many thousands of bar-girls, by those unfortunate individuals, who think that they would die if they did not gratify their drinking propensities on the Sunday. Many of these young women have to work seven days in the week, and have virtually no Sabbath free from the helotry of the bar.</p>
